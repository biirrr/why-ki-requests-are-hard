goodreads	13195	1	Angela	2008-08-05T00:00:00Z	A book about a child who goes to school, but she is neglected by her parents (mother?). She is very unclean. Possibly abused. Mute. I believe the teacher helps the child to speak by becoming her ally. I read this about fifteen years ago and I cannot remember what it is called.				TW: abuse
goodreads	13195	2	Krista the Krazy Kataloguer	2008-08-05T00:00:00Z	Well, it sounds like The Bears' House by Marilyn Sachs (c1971). Here's the plot summary: Although she sucks her thumb, smells bad, and loses herself in the make-believe world of the three bears' dollhouse, ten-year-old Fran knows how to take care of her baby sister better than anybody else. I've read it, and there's definitely a teacher involved who tries to help her.				
goodreads	13195	3	Angela	2008-08-05T00:00:00Z	Thanks Krista. I will look into this. This was an excellent book and I really hope to find the title and author so that I can re-read it.				
goodreads	13195	4	Lisa Vegan	2008-08-05T00:00:00Z	It also sounds like One Child/Sheila (except it was a father, not a mother) or one of the other books by Torey Hayden: http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/... Her books are true stories from when she worked in special ed, and are ya/adult, not children's. Although Krista the Krazy Kataloguer usuaally gets it right, I thought I'd jump in.				
goodreads	13195	5	Angela	2008-08-05T00:00:00Z	I just came across her when I was researching it on Amazon. It does sound like it and the year it was written is about right. I always remembered it being the mother, but it could have been the father.				
goodreads	13195	6	Cindy	2008-08-05T00:00:00Z	In Torey Hayden's book Ghost Girl the student is mute and abused. I don't remember if it was her mother or father who abused her, I read it years and years ago, but check it out and see what you think.				
goodreads	13195	7	Ellenjsmellen	2008-08-05T00:00:00Z	Has this been solved? I'm not sure if it's Torey Hayden's One Child, but I remember a book that starts out where a girl ties a little boy up to a tree and sets him on fire. Is this the one?				
goodreads	13195	8	Lauren	2008-08-05T00:00:00Z	not sure which hayden book starts with the little girl tying the boy up and burning him, but it's definitely one of hers.				
goodreads	13195	9	Lisa Vegan	2008-08-05T00:00:00Z	I don't think that's from One Child/Sheila, but I'm not certain because all of Torey Hayden's books' contents have melded in my mind.				
goodreads	13195	10	Amy	2008-08-05T00:00:00Z	One Child is about Sheila, and starts with the girl tying the boy up to the tree. Her mom has abandoned her, her dad takes care of her but she is neglected. The sequel to this is The Tiger's child. I read both these books in the past year. If you go to Torey Hayden's website, it shows her books.				
goodreads	13195	11	Lisa Vegan	2008-08-05T00:00:00Z	Ah, thanks Kirei. I loved all of Torey Hayden's books but had forgotten that.

Here's the plot summary from Amazon: Fields of white opium poppies stretch away over the hills, and uniformed workers bend over the rows, harvesting the juice. This is the empire of Matteo Alacran, a feudal drug lord in the country of Opium, which lies between the United States and Aztlan, formerly Mexico. Field work, or any menial tasks, are done by """"eejits,"""" humans in whose brains computer chips have been installed to insure docility. Alacran, or El Patron, has lived 140 years with the help of transplants from a series of clones, a common practice among rich men in this world. The intelligence of clones is usually destroyed at birth, but Matt, the latest of Alacran's doubles, has been spared because he belongs to El Patron. He grows up in the family's mansion, alternately caged and despised as an animal and pampered and educated as El Patron's favorite. Gradually he realizes the fate that is in store for him, and with the help of Tam Lin, his bluff and kind Scottish bodyguard, he escapes to Aztlan. There he and other """"lost children"""" are trapped in a more subtle kind of slavery before Matt can return to Opium to take his rightful place and transform his country.

Shot and killed in front of her, the body is soon removed, the only clue to the death a spot of blood and a crumpled piece of paper. Mira discovers a list of names on the paper, including her own, and the word 'Watcher' beside one of her contemporaries in the village. Suddenly Mira feels threatened and, increasingly paranoid about the motives of those around her, she plans her escape from the community she's known all her life. Heading towards the capital, she soon discovers an urban nightmare she'd never suspected. A city led by ruling families, where the families are kept in power through their reliance on 'spares' - or clones. Mira herself is a clone of Clarissa, the daughter of one of the governors. Clarissa's brother spots Mira on the streets and is intrigued by her. As he discovers the truth behind his family situation, he determines to help her escape. She is too dangerous to be left 'at large' and is being pursued. Together they head for France, where they know a third 'spare' is being brought up."	unusable

The overall plot is that the clones are raised on an island off of south eastern US coast. The clones are raised in """"ideal"""" environment. They get regular injections, are educated, etc. Occasionally it is found that one of them has an illness and they disappear or have a surgery and go back to their utopian lives. Two males and a female get wise to the strangeness of the situation and start investigating. One is murdered. The girl is found to be sick on a regular checkup and disappears.

Thanks in advance. Deborah				
goodreads	37787	2	Lisa Vegan	2008-08-05T00:00:00Z	Deborah, Was it one of Nancy Friday's books? Most of them are women's fantasies but she wrote one with women telling their actual experiences. Edit: Hmm. My Secret Garden and Forbidden Flowers are both women's sexual fantasy books. Don't see any actual stories. Either she or another author wrote one back in that era, and I know that I have it somewhere on my bookcases at home, but not easily/quickly available to look at. I'll keep thinking if these books are not the ones you're trying to remember. Edit again: Shared Intimacies, Erotic Interludes, Pleasure, etc. by Lonnie Barbach are also possibilites although those go into the 1980s.

From Head Butler website: """"As âDonbasâ opens, Jacques is 16 years old, 6 feet 2 inches tall, 180 pounds. He's the youngest person in the box car filled with Romanians that the Russians are shipping east in January of 1945. But his youth vanishes fast when he watches guards execute some would-be escapees. On one hand, he envies their death: âno more cold, misery, hunger.â On the other, he wants to live. Which means he'll have to escape. This is a book about noticing everything, paying sharp attention, looking for an opening. His first conclusion: Don't try to escape in winter, don't think you can get out of Russia without knowing Russian. But after a few days of working in the coal mines of Donbas (now considered part of the Ukraine), his thoughts turn from escape to survival. The work is wet and cold. A cave-in could come at any time. Exhaustion, exposure, hunger --- death comes in many forms here. I have never read an account of work in a mine that made me so claustrophobic. I found myself reading faster, as if getting to the end of a particularly horrible shift would provide some relief. But it didn't --- above ground, there were sadistic guards and icy winds. âMany prisoners died,â Jacques reports matter-of-factly. âOver half the camp. Four hundred and fifty weak and sick weren't suffering any more.â Jacques is comparatively well off. He is strong and uncomplaining, a good worker. He gets privileges --- when he goes to nearby homes for dinner, it's a delight to read as he eats and eats and eats. But he's never fooled; there's always a power-mad guard around the corner. And one does beat him so badly he almost dies. Which makes it all the more satisfying when, with the permission of a senior officer, Jacques stomps that sadist mercilessly. âIt was a good feeling while it lasted,â he says. I think even a pacifist would agree. After two and a half years, his luck runs out. Jacques is trapped in a cave-in and rescued only by a friend's heroic efforts. He fears his legs will be amputated. It's winter, but so what --- he must escape. His legs are running with pus, he is a mass of sores, but he slips onto a train, hides in an open coal car and begins the slow, freezing ride to the West. Books like this have a built-in handicap --- we know the author survived. Only the best of the breed make us forget that there's a happy ending. And this is the best; reading these pages, you will feel cold and hungry, raging with fever, wet and dispirited. But mostly, you will feel Jacques Sandulescu's spirit, his unyielding insistence on life, life in free air, life at all costs."""""	solved	Donbas: A True Story of an Escape Across Russia	8868250	by Jacques Sandulescu

We did a science fiction unit and read a bunch of sci-fi short stories like Harrison Bergeron and poems, etc. This poem was about aliens looking down on earth and seeing these creatures (cars) racing down the streets and highways. The aliens mused about what they saw, wondering whether the globby soft tissues inside the hard metal skeletons were the creatures' brains or their guts? Can anyone out there help with this?

I didn't have to get very far into it to realize it was written by a racist. It was an awful book, but it was a very interesting look into the mind of a 60's racist. The book was written in the 60's.

goodreads	811897	1	Andy	2012-08-05T00:00:00Z	I think that might have been the subtitle of the book; something like Guy's name & Girl's name: an Adult Fairy Tale . The guy was an elven prince, raised by shepherds for his protection after a war or assassination. The girl was an elven princess who had to marry a prince, only supposedly there were none left. Details, the elves had an alternate form; his was a faun, and hers was a doe. Elves have pairs of sex organs, one above the other, in the case of a male, one is normally hidden, the other shows up as part of the arousal process. The book begins with a seduction scene between the princess in her doe form and the prince as he's watching his sheep. A dwarf princess sees our hero in his faun form and falls in lust with him. She sends several of her father's retainers to kidnap the elf and they succeed. This is kinda pointless, since dwarfs and elves are NOT sexually compatible. Dwarf males have long, coiled penes that they keep coiled around their waists except during sex. Dwarf females have corresponding organs. The way dwarfs screw (pun intended) is for the male to lay on his back, while the female is suspended from a harness and wound up, so that as the harness unwinds, the two partners are screwed together. Needless to say, this will not work with a massive but straight penis. Of course they try it anyway, the princess gets bounced out of the harness and... From what I remember, the book was more silly than it was funny, and I'd probably only read it once and put it away. It's more the fact that I can't remember it that makes it seem interesting. Thanks for reading.

It's non-fiction, written by a man about his daughter, who is nick-named Twink, and her cat.

By the way, this may perhaps be readily guessed from the amount of time that takes place over the course of the book (approximately 16 years) but, although as mentioned before, this is a lighthearted story about a special animal-human bond (view spoiler) [ the book ends on a weepy note with the beloved cat's death (hide spoiler)] .

She was German (not Jewish) and I think her name was Katarine but when by Katy/Katie/Kady or something like that. She had a brother named Peter but it was spelled different. Maybe something like Peider??? She wrote about many of her experiences. I specifically remember her talking about Nazi guards impregnating women prisoners and then the babies would have experiments done on them to try to change things like their eye color to blue. The book made a serious impression on me because it was the first book I remember reading about concentration camps. I would love to be able to find out the name so I can read it again.

goodreads	966737	27	Kris	2016-08-05T00:00:00Z	I Will Survive by Sala Pawlowicz for Pen's suggestion.				
goodreads	966737	28	SparksofEmber	2016-08-05T00:00:00Z	"A description of 'I Will Survive"""" found at franklinbookstore: Sala Pawlowicz (nee Kaminska) endured forced labour at an ammunition factory in Czestochowa. 'I Will Survive' was written with Kevin Klose, at the time a young reporter in New York (where Pawlowicz had settled after the war), who later rose to prominence as the president of National Public Radio (NPR), the United States' largest nonprofit radio outlet for news and cultural programming. The writing style in 'I Will Survive' is descriptive and heartfelt, and follows a chronological narrative from the German invasion of Poland to Pawlowicz's eventual liberation at Belsen in 1945, and subsequent recovery from typhus. The reader is drawn into a harrowing world of mindless brutality and degredation, but despite her sufferering, Pawlowicz's spirit emerges intact, fortified by events late in her captivity when an unknown benefactor began smuggling items of food and notes of encouragement to her."				
goodreads	966737	29	Pen Avey	2016-08-05T00:00:00Z	This is definitely the book Kathy mentioned a few comments back, as I also read it as a young teen and it had a lasting impression on me, too.				
goodreads	966737	30	Jennifer Thompson	2017-08-05T00:00:00Z	Hi, I too read this book as a teenager back in the 80's. It was titled I Survive (I think) and it was an autobiographical hardcover book written by a Polish jewish woman. I too remember her name as Katya or similar. I actually had the book for many years and then during a tidy up in the 2000's my husband tossed it out with some books going to a book fair. I am still so sad about that because it was such a moving (and well written) account of the experiences of this woman in the concentration camp... And, in doing a little searching and my memory dragging up Krystina as closer to the right name I found this which IS the book I read: http://www.books.e-oswiecim.pl/i-surv...

I canât remember how I figured it out but I did. It is Too Stubborn To Die:A Child of Nordhausen by Cato Jaramillo and Anne Florence.

goodreads	979007	1	Eric Flynn	2012-08-05T00:00:00Z	Hey Folks! Posting here, since I am asking about a piece of artwork with a book in it, not an actual book. Back in the early 90's, there was a surrealist art print that was really popular. It showed a young girl sitting on the floor, reading a book whose pages were blowing in the wind, some of which were tearing free and flying away, changing shape as they went. The seashore was coming down the hallway, right up to the little girl and was cleverly blended with the floor, so that you weren't sure whether the girl was on the floor or on the beach. There was also a fire on the floor. Does anyone remember the name of this print or the name of the artist? I'd love to find this again! Cheers, Eric	unusable			art

Anyway, that part was about a girl with a really pretty older sister and I believe their mother was concerned that she'd get into trouble because she was so pretty.

goodreads	1136789	1	Arielle Masters	2017-08-05T00:00:00Z	bumping - any luck, Rachel? You said forest/jungle and Australian author, so it's most likely not Olive, the Other Reindeer (author lives in San Francisco), but the artwork is somewhat similar in style... https://www.amazon.com/Olive-Other-Re...				
goodreads	1136789	1	Rachel Gill	2013-08-05T00:00:00Z	Hi, I was read a picture book in primary school that I'm hoping to track down. Most likely published in the 80's or early 90's. Unfortunately I cannot even remember a title or author. The book however stuck in my mind as it seemed to have very bright and colourful patterns and I believe there were a few titles published by this author. I'm thinking perhaps the artwork was painted, maybe even in watercolour by the author but I might be wrong. I'm also not sure but it might have been an Australian author. All I could find online which had some similar artwork as to what I remember is the first picture at this link: http://grainedit.com/2011/02/03/hvass... . This isn't the author but the style is very similar. And it isn't Eric Carle either I'm pretty sure of that. Sorry this is so vague, if anyone remembers something similar I'd be most grateful! Thank you, Rachel :-)				
goodreads	1136789	2	Mir	2017-08-05T00:00:00Z	Any chance it is Jan Ormerod ? She is Australian and her book Lizzie Nonsense had a family living in a forest. The mother and daughter were waiting while the father was away working. That's probably not old enough, but she has older stuff (as far back the 1980s) that I haven't read.

Thank you for bumping and for all your help but you can just delete this question if you like as I feel like a real ongoing nuisance! I'm sure I'll come across it one day when I'm not even looking for it :-) Kind wishes, Rachel				
goodreads	1136789	3	Cheryl	2013-08-05T00:00:00Z	Some of the art by Ellen Walsh and Leo Lionni is a bit similar, but usually not so bright. Hmm... Do you remember if there were mice, or jungle animals, or farm animals, or people, or.... ?

goodreads	1136789	7	Rachel Gill	2013-08-05T00:00:00Z	Hi all, Thank you so much for your kind help :-) Mary - all I can remember is a forest, I think that's where the picture book was set. I'm sorry that doesn't help much! Cheryl - thank you very much. None of these seem to resonate with me. But I really appreciate all your suggestions. Lobstergirl - this does look close but again, not exactly the one I remember. Nevermind though, as most things you forget you come across them when you aren't even looking so I'm sure one day when I'm browsing through some old books I'll come across it again! Thanks for all your help :-) Kind wishes, Rachel				
goodreads	1136789	8	Rachel Gill	2017-08-05T00:00:00Z	Thank you for the kind words of encouragement all! :-) Sorry Amanda I don't think it was The Children in the Jungle but I really appreciate the suggestion! Adele - although Rainforest Children doesn't look or sound familiar it seems to be the closest match yet!! Thank you very much. Perhaps it is the one. I'll try to get my hands on a copy.

She's both popular and prodigious, with a large range of illustrators. Someone might pop. You could also try http://www.illustratorsaustralia.com/... , but it is by no means exhaustive. Do you recall any of the narrative content?				
goodreads	1136789	18	Sarah A.	2020-08-05T00:00:00Z	Hi, Is there any chance it could be The Umbrella, by Jan Brett? That was a gorgeously drawn story about the rainforest. Or the Great Kapok Tree?				
goodreads	1136789	18	Tab	2014-08-05T00:00:00Z	This is a stretch, but Bringing the Rain to Kapiti Plain: A Nandi Tale has that cross of painterly and graphic pattern style of illustration. I remember it being really popular in the 80s (It was featured on Reading Rainbow)				
goodreads	1136789	19	Rainbowheart	2020-08-05T00:00:00Z	I know you said early '90s, could it have been pubbed as late as '94?				
goodreads	1136789	19	Rachel Gill	2014-08-05T00:00:00Z	Hi Cruth, Thanks for your suggestions! I'm quite familiar with Mem Fox and it isn't her stories. I looked through the website you suggested and nothing stood out as being the one I'm looking for I'm afraid. Unfortunately I'm hopelessly unaware of the narrative content. It was read to me in primary school once or twice which is many years ago now lol. All I can picture is the bright colours, and perhaps something with trees or a forest is also a distant memory I have. Thanks also for your suggestion Tab. Most appreciated. This one doesn't ring a bell with me, and I don't believe the story was native/indigenous at all. Sorry I know this is a difficult one! Grateful for both your suggestions though :) Kind wishes, Rachel				
goodreads	1136789	20	Rachel Gill	2020-08-05T00:00:00Z	Neither of those I'm sorry Sarah :-( Rainbowheart it's more likely 80's I think as I was read it in primary school. 1994 would have been too late.

Lois Ehlert was suggested earlier in the thread and is certainly very close to the type of artwork I remember! Perhaps reminds me more of Eric Carle's style however than the one I am picturing. And ok Ann thank you I'll do that. I just feel like a nuisance saying 'no that's not it' to everyone that's trying to help lol, everyone has been so kind :)				
goodreads	1136789	49	Ann aka Iftcan	2015-08-05T00:00:00Z	If you can give a reason why the book isn't it--or what is similar to your book--it helps to narrow the search down each time. So, keep on telling us no, but tell us WHY too.

She got in better shape, went back to school, divorced her husband when he fought her about the changes, and showed her child/children that it could be done.

But the beady eyes of the Rat King showed no form of innocence or purity. Some would claim that the world had been too hard on him for such a thing, and others would say it was lost in the constant loom of his own death âhovering, like a lurking rat- over him. But what they all agreed was that huddled in his ancient sanctuary, beneath the child-like face, laid a caged beast; a madness which at unexpected moments, could be released. it was saved on a long forgotten word document. I believe it must be from some book I wanted to read.	unusable			quote

In my opinion, this paragraph doesn't read like anything from a book--just the grammar and organization of it don't seem to come from a published novel. (The use of 'such a thing' and 'it' referring to 'innocence and purity,' confusingly worded; 'laid,' in the last sentence, which I'm sure should be 'lay;' and just small flaws like that which would be taken care of during the editing process, or so I'd assume, if this were from a book.)

goodreads	1181950	1	Ori Vandewalle	2013-08-05T00:00:00Z	I'm hoping this is a book I'm looking for and not a TV episode or movie. What I remember is just a fragment of a scene. Two male characters are having a meeting. One is a businessman pitching an idea. The idea is a way to introduce artificial scarcity by creating products that destroy every other instance of that product when it is consumed. It's supposed to give people the satisfaction of consuming the last of something in the world, which couldn't ordinarily be done in a world where everything can be replicated. The example given is an apple, which the businessman takes out of a very elaborately designed box that might be made of gold. When the other guy eats the apple, all other apples like it in the world instantly rot or have worms in them or something like that. The point of all this is to create something unique that can then be sold for a profit. That's all I can remember. I don't even remember if this is an important part of the story or just some throwaway scene. Whatever it is, I encountered it recently, within the past few months. Thanks for any help you guys can provide. Edit: It's from SMBC. Not book. Nevermind.	unusable			comicstrip

goodreads	1213463	1	Raz	2013-06-27T00:00:00Z	Not a lot to go on I know. I was thinking of a book which I read sometime in the 90s. It was a high-fantasy novel with magic, may have been part of a series. The protagonist, who I think was a man, spent some time at a city or castle or something with magic users who may have been wise and there to offer him advice on his quest, or to help with it. I seem to recall a large table and a feast and I think he just stopped at the castle/city/place on his quest. His friend, who he initially thought of as male (I think) switches genders and becomes female and says this is something all of them can do. I think the main character found this strange. I remember being disappointed by what happens to this secondary character, I think they either die, or they just disappear. This is definitely not by Ursula LeGuin and is definitely not The Left Hand of Darkness. I likely borrowed it from my local library from either the teenage section, or from the sci-fi/fantasy section. EDIT: I'm wondering if it's possibly a Tanith Lee book. My library no longer has any of her books though so I can't check and it's so long ago I can't remember all those I've read.	unsolved

The main protagonist's friend and traveling companion is a shape-shifter from another world, somehow trapped in this one and unable to change shape. At some point he experiences something that allows him to change shape again and changes from a man to a woman.

Main character is female - not male. The gender changer is a incubus/succubus who switches back and forth between genders during orgasm -- and it's more of a side-plot, not very prominent. Feasts do play a part, since the main character has to conjure them often. (It's a very silly book - more typical of Anthony than of Lackey.)	unsolved

I think it's an isolated incident, although something all of the magic-people can do. It strikes the hero as odd, I think he requests that his friend switches back, or at least he's uncomfortable enough with it. I definitely think it's only at the feast in the castle place where the friend is female, the rest of the time they're male. I think the magic-ish people weren't human, but human-esque. Strangely, I'm thinking there was a journey along a river in the book, or through snow where the 'friend' disappeared. (Definitely not Left Hand of Darkness or Ice Song though.) I do remember strongly thinking that this friend just disappeared, either being forgotten by the author, or left behind, or possibly died.	unsolved

goodreads	1213463	26	Ket	2015-06-27T00:00:00Z	I'm reading this book right now and remembered this post, wondered if you'd looked into it maybe being Imajica by Clive Barker: Imajica I haven't finished the book yet, but it seems to match your description. The secondary character is a magical being (mystif) at first perceived by the main character as a male, but later is defined as kind of non-gendered, which is normal for mystifs, and is later perceived as female. Not a huge plot-point, but definitely memorable. Would have been in the sci fi/fantasy section - has elements of the modern day, but half the book is taking place in another magical realm. Where I'm reading, the primary and secondary character just stopped to eat with a family, and the mystif was perceived as female and the head of the house made advances towards him/her, and the protagonist got peeved about it. In this book most of the magical realm characters are only human-esque. The two main characters are plodding through the snow in a perilous journey over a mountaintop right now in my reading in much the same way that the characters in Left Hand of Darkness traveled together. I don't know what happens to the secondary character, yet! But it was matching many other points so I wanted to put it out there. Also, it was published in 1991.	unsolved

May have been another person as well, I don't remember clearly. The book mainly is about the lead detective or prosecutor getting the main witness to talk about it. The witness, an attractive white woman, was a minor participant in the crime. The difficulty is that she lies. A lot. It takes multiple interviews with her to finally get her to tell the truth about what happened. Possibly disgusting detail: (view spoiler) [The drugs were hidden in a plastic bag in the female victim's vagina. The witness was made to pull them out after the killings by the shooters. (hide spoiler)] A couple of other details: The witness, years earlier, was raped by 2 soldiers. She refused to press charges against them because they might get the death penalty if convicted. The investigator took the woman to a restaurant or club to try and get her in a more relaxed state of mind. While there, a local ADA tried to pick her up and had to be warned off by the investigator. Book probably came out back in the 80s.

goodreads	1457836	1	Meagan	2013-08-05T00:00:00Z	I am trying to find a book I read as a child( I am 30yo). It was about a pioneer family. The story is told from the point of view from the daughter, who had blond hair. Parts of the story that I can remember: the girl hears drums at night and gets afraid. Her father comforts her. She has a doll that looks like her. Her family meet an Indian family that has a girl the same age as the pioneer girl. In the teepee the pioneer girl trips near the fire and her doll gets singed. The Indian girl saves the doll and gives it back to the pioneer girl. I don't believe this was a chapter book. I remember it was beautifully illustrated. Any ideas?

That seems to be a more involved, longer story for older readers than the one I remember, which is exactly as described. I believe it starts when the pioneer family has just moved, and they end up being invited to an event of some sort (not sure if it's in a teepee or maybe a longhouse?). The little girl watches everyone dancing around the fire, and when it's her turn, that's when she trips and her doll falls into the fire. I think it was about realizing that others are just like you and not to be feared. I do recall that it was beautifully illustrated. Can anyone help? Is the original poster still here?

goodreads	1468018	1	Stephanie	2013-08-05T00:00:00Z	This is not about a book but Iâve been searching for so long I wanted to give it a shot here. When I was younger I found this tape - it wasnât a home recording of a radio show it was an actual tape produced by a radio broadcast company Iâm guessing or something like this. It was an old radio show recording complete with voice actors and sound effects like the sound of running, a baby crying and gun shots. It was obviously a murder mystery and the intro had this loud organ music. The story was about a detective (I think he was a detective) and his right hand man; they went to the home of these three sisters one of whom was named Charity or Chastity or something like that but everyone called her cherry. I donât remember the names of the other sisters but I think they were also virtue names like Faith or Graceâ¦ Anyway so these two men came to their home to solve a mystery â they were hearing a baby cry in the night and there had been a murder (at least I think there had been a murder before they got there but there was for sure one while they were thereâ¦). The youngest sister Cherry was kind of crazy she cried and fainted and kept talking about âtheyâ. âTheyâ were coming and âTheyâ were angry and would kill againâ¦ no one know who âTheyâ was. In the end it turned out that it was cherry all along who had been doing these things even making the crying baby noises. She had been locked in her room as a child for hours and hours at a time and the mother goose characters on the wall paper in her room had taken on a life of their own. These characters where the âTheyâ she had been talking about and in her head they were the ones committing the murders and crying in the night but it was actually Cherry (or Charity or Chastity or whatever) who had been doing it all alongâ¦	unusable			looking for a tape / radio show

Unfortunately I read it as an ebook, so I didn't have a cover picture to go by. I am fairly certain it was set on Earth; at first I had thought it might have been The Puppet Masters, until I went back and read that. If I had to guess, if not Heinlein, it was another sci-fi author of that time period. I am fairly sure that, if not aliens involved in the story, then it was probably one of those where scientists get to playing around with some chemical/biological discovery that seems to improve people but has unintended side effects. Perhaps the chimp was an escaped test subject?

They find out the reason (view spoiler) [all life evolves to a certain level of intelligence, but there's a damping field traveling through space; we evolved while in the damping field, and when it goes away again the electromagnetism changes and our neurons send impulses faster (hide spoiler)] .

I've attempted an internet search but I'm only coming up with modern titles and I have a feeling this particular magazine folded.

goodreads	1549102	1	J	2014-08-05T00:00:00Z	Hello, I'm not looking for a book, so much as a story. A long time ago I found a book of Scottish Folk Tales (paperback compilation, possibly a Penguin book, from the 70s or 80s). One of the stories (the first) was about Why You Should Always Have a Tale To Tell. The story is about a traveller who takes shelter from a storm in a house on the moors, his host suggests they tell stories to pass the time. However the traveller knows no stories so he goes to bed early. That night a sound wakes him and he goes outside - he is then chased across the moors by *something* and tries to escape by swimming a river etc etc The next morning he is back at the house and leaves as soon as possible. The last thing his host says to him is about how now he'll always have a story to tell. Does anyone know a version of this story? Or the book it was in? I'd really like to rediscover the details! Many thanks!	unusable			story

This was one that I was not supposed to read, my mom had bought it for my older sister (she was starting to go to a lot of parties and my mother was really scared of something bad happening to her: I suspect this book was a way of scaring her/making her know the dangers of the world). But I took it and read it anyway when no one was seeing. Anyway, the book was written by a woman, and I think she was some kind of psychiatrist/psychologist (don't know what's the appropiate word in English here) who specialized on treating girls that had been sexually abused. I remember the book shocked me a lot because of the events described. Btw I was 10 or 11, so this must have been around 1999 or 2000. If I recall correctly, the book was divided on chapters and each chapter covered the experience of a girl, the techniques used by the woman to try to heal them, and reflections from the author about the case, society, etc. I remember two cases: one, the most shocking of them all, was about a girl who went to party and when she was coming home alone on the street, 4 boys picked her up forcefully and raped her in their car and left her on the street (one of the boys was pretty shocked about what his friends where doing and refused to rape her but didn't stop them either. The guys were saying that she wanted it because she was dressed like a slut). When she came back home she hid the fact from her family first, but later she told them. By the end of the therapy one of the things the author made her do was to write a pretend letter to her rapists in whichthe girl decided to """"forgive"""" the guys (of course they never knew who they were) in order to let go of the burden and be able to go on with her life. The other story I remember was about a young blond girl that went to the house of a friend and when she was alone with her father he touched her. It was quite the fearmongering book. I don't remember much else right now, but it may come to me later. The book was most probably from USA. I read the Spanish edition, but all the names were in English."

It is similar in nature -- a book aimed at a popular audience about science/math. I think this one is more math-focused. The two things I remember that aren't in 1,2,3 Infinity are: -- A section where the author talks about some scientific formula to discover if things are beautiful. He mentions the poem """"Kubla Khan"""" as the """"official"""" most beautiful poem. He also discusses which shape is most beautiful (I don't remember but it may have been the circle) and maybe even which individual word. There may have been some tongue-in-cheek here. -- A section where the author talks about gematria. He was discussing it with two coworkers (co-authors on another project, perhaps) and they expressed skepticism at how it could work. So he made some stuff up right there and then about how their names were meaningful, and the example I remember is how Warren Weaver's name meant that he would be naturally good at knitting war-related activities together.

It's about a teenaged girl who meets an older male artist, I believe in his 40s, who is not married but has had a partner for several years and they have children. When he falls in love with the girl, they begin an affair, and I recall one scene especially where the artist's partner tearfully explains that she never married him because she knew he would find """"the one"""" eventually and she didn't want to hold this genius artist back, and she knew in her heart that this teenaged girl was """"the one."""" There was also mention of the girl's school being near the artist's studio, and I believe she walked there for their assignations. I may be making it sound tackier than it was, though I really don't know. The author was male, I'm almost positive.

The camp is run by two guys - one looks ordinary, and the other a big burly guy (maybe ginger haired?). Both are friendly and nice. They have to march long distances each morning to eat breakfast. There's zip lining. There's canoeing. At the end, each kid is left alone in the wilderness by themselves. Something goes wrong, and the protagonist has to find and rally the kids together I think the protagonist, at the start of the book, tried to steal a car, crashed, and was in the hospital injured. That's how he got caught and sent to the camp. I also think near the beginning of the book, when the kids are being bused to the camp, one of the kids tries to escape by climbing out the bathroom window at a rest stop. The book was written before 2001. It was most likely a young adults books, for young kids.

Action occurs in the outback of southwestern Colorado and northern Arizona as Al, their adult leader, programs the group first to climb Storm King Peak (which nearly results in fatalities) and then to raft the white water of the San Juan River. The Hoods decide rafting the Colorado River will be wilder; so they steal Al's van and equipment, drive to the put-in at Lee's Ferry, sneak past the park rangers, inflate their rafts, and seven embark--one deserts. Rafting the wild Colorado is heady but difficult and dangerous. Misadventures develop the kids, but also breed disasters.

goodreads	1827494	1	Rainbowheart	2014-08-05T00:00:00Z	Hi, You guys got my last one so quickly, dare I hold out hope for a repeat performance? ;) When I was in college, we read an excerpt of a young lesbian girl's diary in one of my women's studies or women's history classes. It was from a book (an actual book) of women's diaries that I think was published in the '80s. Pink cover, maybe? The professor had a copy of the book on her desk, but we students only had photocopies of the relevant diary. Since we only read the one diary, I can't give details as to the contents of the rest of the book, but this particular diary was written by a young girl growing up in the early 1900s. Prior to the first World War, maybe 1900 to 1912 or something similar? The girl was about 10 or 11 when she started the diary. She lived in a small town and her father was a shopkeeper. He might have owned a general store. She wrote a lot about her friends and most particularly about all the crushes she had on young women, especially a teacher. As she gets older, she worries about this in the diary and about not falling in love with men. I think finally in late high school or college, she starts a relationship with a boy, but in the postscript to the diary it's revealed that the author did eventually end up coming out as a lesbian in the 1950s. Long shot, but I've wondered for years about this. I don't think the woman was anyone famous, but I'm not 100% on that.

The woman who wrote this diary was writing it in the early 1900s. Prior to the first World War, but not as far back as the 19th century. This girl's diary was only one of several in the book, not the entire book. So I guess that's why I'm having trouble finding it. She didn't have a whole book of her own.

Soon her and her neighbor become friends and she also becomes friends with his other male friends, there is about 4 or 5 boys total that she becomes friends with. Her mom's preferred """"punishment"""" is having her daughter kneel on rice for hours at a time. At one point in the book she ties her to a stool in the tub and runs the shower as hot as it can get then leaves her in there until well after the water runs cold. That particular day she manages to make a call to one of the guys she became friends with and they come and help her. Towards the end of the book her mother finds out about her friendship with the boys and believes she is sleeping with them. This time for punishment she makes her strip naked and sit in her armoire and not move unless told otherwise, her friends realize she missed school and went to her home to help her. In the end of the book she finds out her mother isn't her birth mother and her father had supposedly raped her birth mother which she was the product of. Throughout the book it was hinted at that the boys were part of a group of fighters or agents of some sort under the guidance of a teacher at their school and because the girl they befriended had no record of birth or social security they wanted her to join them.

I definitely remember all the major gods/goddesses' pictures being in the book. The picture of Aphrodite was so beautiful that I had it screen printed onto a tank top, which I still have.

goodreads	1902748	3	Lobstergirl	2014-08-05T00:00:00Z	So we can rule out Edith Hamilton ? Mythology was first published in 1942, and Echo of Greece in 1957. Mythology was illustrated by Steele Savage; some images can be seen here. They are largely black and white line drawings (shaded) or black and white lithographs. https://www.google.com/search?q=steel...

It is not Hamilton's Mythology, and the images are not drawn by Steele Savage. They are almost like outlines, and they are only of the god or goddess's face or whole body. The name of the god or goddess is included in the picture. The drawings are very ethereal and remind me of art deco or art nouveau images.

'Strike up the Band' is a once-famous but now-forgotten Broadway musical of the 1930s. George S. Kaufman wrote the original book which was a turbulent and absurd political satire (the US and Switzerland declaring war over high cheese import tariffs). Kaufman then collaborated with George Gerwshin to modify it for the musical. The war was turned into a 'dream/nightmare sequence'--the cheese was changed to chocolate, and the whole thing was made silly and humorous. Modified for the theater-going public. What I'm interested in finding is Kaufman's original book. The musical is irrelevant to me. Any help? Thx	unusable			not KI

The main character was an anthropomorphic animal/monster. I want to say it was a porcupine, but it might have been a raccoon or something. Every day, the character would have to walk by a pool (or maybe over a bridge), and he would see a """"Thing"""" in the pool that scared him [SPOILER: his reflection]. He asked lots of other animals/characters how to deal with the """"Thing"""", and they gave him aggressive answers (make a scary face, shake a stick at it), to which the """"Thing"""" always responded in kind. When he finally asks his mom, she tells him to """"smile at the thing in the pool"""", to which the """"Thing"""" also responds in kind, and makes our little protagonist feel better and less scared.

goodreads	2066680	1	Bargle	2015-06-27T00:00:00Z	This SF book was written by a writer known more for mysteries. Came out back in the 80s or 90s, maybe even the early 2000s. Set in a dystopian future. A group of criminals, bandits or whatever, all males, numbering around 4-6. One member is needlessly violent. One is a young man or boy with mild retardation or some other mental handicap. I think he was the main character. The boy stops the group leader from killing the violent one at one point. They break into a home where there's a small gap in the perimeter scanners of the home and this is where the incident of the boy stopping the violent one being killed occurs. I only read about 1/4-1/3 of the book, so I don't know how it ends or what the major story theme was. It was a full length novel, not a short story. ETA: The setting was, I think, a wasteland with isolated pockets of modern technology. The home they break into was off by itself, I think. The book was recent or new when I read it. ETA: I think the group leader wanted to kill the violent one because he had needlessly killed one of the people in the house they had invaded. ETA: I'm reasonably certain it was a male author. ETA: The group of men the retarded boy is part of are the only characters we meet other than the people whose home is invaded. There may have been others later in the book, but it starts with just this small group. ETA: It was a new hardcover at the time I read it. About 200-300 pages. It's not something by Fredric Brown Isaac Asimov John D. MacDonald Donald E. Westlake Suggestions of other authors, even if not a specific book are welcome. I keep feeling like I'll recognize the author name if I see it. ETA: Apparently I won't. ETA: not P.D. James Lawrence Block Rex Stout Robert B.

I ordered the collection from the library to check it out. In the meantime, the Out of the Ashes series by William Johnstone Johnson (2014) does match the tone of the summary. It might be useful for you to plug that book into a """"reads-like"""" search engine. The """"Dies the Fire"""" series by Stirling is another one that you might plug into a """"reads-like"""" search.

There were two groups of people, basically good guys and bad guys, that battled each other at various points.

All of this happens in a flashback, a story the gunslinger Roland is telling his buddies around a fire decades later, so don't let the description of the frame story throw you off.

Also, @Paraphilly as soon as I wrote """"it's not Anthony"""" I thought """"you know it might actually be Anthony"""" because his main characters are frequently vulnerable in some way (youth, mental capacity, orphan, what have you...and I never read that trilogy you suggested. Never even heard of it. his big stuff was Bio of a Space Tyrant, Xanth, and Split Infinity and The Caterpillar's Question is with the autistic protagonist and even in the 90s there was an issue with some of the stuff that happens with the character. Anyway. My mental picture of this story is all over the place. There is a book called Vampire Winter (post-apocalyptic, youth gang, some tech, and the protagonist/narrator is not mentally challenged--HEY is the mentally challenged kid the one narrating the story or is the author describing all points of view?) but immediately post-disaster so not that...or is it?) and The World Next Door was a good post nuclear read with some gang stuff but no home invasion. Deathlands and Outlands were churned out every other month during that time but it is more """"lone warrior hot babe also killing and probably a motorcycle"""" vibe and no mystery author so not those. There was a series of postnuclear survival fiction that went several books and was filled with mutations and sexism, but big groups, not a small gang so not that. There's the John Wesley Rawles stuff with gangs and home invasions but he is not a mystery writer. There is a male/female pairing postnuclear with gangs in When the Wind Blows, but that is a graphic novel. Most of the major, easy to find stuff that makes it onto any list--I have read. So it must be something harder to find or not usually considered dystopian or post-collapse/apocalyptic"

Yes, almost as soon as I submitted I thought of several examples of him using neurodivergent characters and characters with physical/mental challenges. In terms of style though--I can't picture him writing a story that fits the description and he is not known for mysteries. That doesn't mean as much though because, based on Bargle comments throughout, there is a small chance he is off on a detail or two. Thought: If the world is is mostly empty that eliminates a lot of possibles right off the bat. If I understand publishing correctly not all books come out in hardcover first. It was a new hardcover release at the time of reading and that eliminates some of the trashier, straight to paperback. I am going to start researching hardboiled mystery writers that made bank in the late 70s/early 80s because they would probably be an established seller to have a hardcover release."

Came out back in the 80s or 90s, maybe even the early 2000s. It was a full-length novel, or possibly a novella, not a short story. 200-300 pages. Post disaster, but disaster unknown. No zombies. Rural area. A wasteland. Likely in the USA or Canada. Narrative occurs in the present-tense--there are probably not long flashbacks to a """"better"""" time. Violent gang of 4-6 male criminals/ bandits, mentally challenged boy is main character/narrator but not leader. The characters in the first third of the book are all men. They probably operated on foot. They probably used guns. The gang is operating in a wasteland with isolated pockets of modern technology. Home invasion, and the home they break into was off by itself, I think. It is likely the characters had regular names, not a collection of nicknames. One member is needlessly violent. They break into a home where there's a small gap in the perimeter scanners of the home and this is where the incident of the boy stopping the violent one being killed occurs.

They list pretty much everything that's under fiction, the hard part is narrowing it down to what you're looking for, especially since their tagging system seems pretty far from complete. But it's what helped me find my unsolved book issue. This link will take you to their 'Post Apocalypse' tag for titles starting in about 2001 and heading backwards into the 90s. You can scroll a bit to see if you can recognize anything or try looking for other tags, but like I said their tagging system is certainly not comprehensive, imho. https://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/tag.cgi...

But in the US, at least, S. 2781 aka Rosa's Law was signed in 2010, 'To change references in Federal law to mental retardation to references to an intellectual disability, and change references to a mentally retarded individual to references to an individual with an intellectual disability', so it's not classified that way in federal health, education or labour policies any more. Some dictionaries cite the adjective form as 'dated, offensive': https://www.lexico.com/definition/ret... And to give an example of what disability rights advocates might say, Special Olympics don't distinguish between different forms of the word: 'The R-word is a form of hate speech that stands for âretard,â âretarded,â or other offensive words ending in â-tard.â While âmental retardationâ was originally introduced as a medical term in 1961 for people with intellectual disabilities, in the decades since, the R-word has become an insult used all too commonly in everyday language.'

Too many people spending time here instead of over there? Author suggestions - John Barnes and Steven Barnes have both written stuff similar to what you're looking for.

Thereâs also Michael Crichton... he wrote under a pen name in college. His novels all do some crossover too between thriller/sci-fi (although him I would categorize as more sci-fi).

(2) Are there other members of the gang that refer to this character in unkind terms that speak to his level of intellect?

The book is Tom O'Bedlam by Robert Silverberg also published as by David Osborne. Solved by Chortnik over at the PrintSF subreddit. Finally, one of my long timers has bit the dust. Why did it take so long? I remembered a lot of things wrong. I've been a member of forgotten books/movies/TV shows/records sites since 2000 and I know errors creep in over time, but this is by far the furthest I've ever been off about something. 1. The author wasn't a well known Mystery writer. 2. He didn't use his middle initial. 3. There were 2 other concurrent plotlines with male and female characters, not just the bandit group. 4. The main character wasn't all that young. Geez, being so wrong about the author made this one much more difficult. If I had got that right, I suspect this would have been solved long ago.	solved / confirmed	Tom O'Bedlam	158881	solved / confirmed by OP (after 10 years??) / this thread is 426 rows long

I will add that reading into this, I am starting to remember now that I did in fact mix up a few of the forensic books I had read at the time. In particular, the Waco events I attributed to Awaking the Dead were I think from a book called No Heroes: Inside the FBI's Secret Counter-Terror Force by Danny O. Coulson and Elaine Shannon. It's funny how much memory comes back from reading a few chapters of a book! Either way - unless there's any objections I think this can finally be marked as solved.

The book seemed autobiographical in nature. I remember he details his first job as working in a beer factory where his job was to test the cleanliness of beer, as at the time beer companies had a buy-back program from pubs and bars. He also worked in firearm forensics or something similar, but had to stop because the repeated gunshot recoil from shotguns was permanently damaging his shoulder.

First, how they used to work in a brewery - when pubs used to be able to sell back beer to the brewery their job was to check the clarity of what was sent back to them as the pubs would collect *everything* to send back in the hopes of getting more money back.

I remember the book cover well but nothing else about it, except that I found it while searching for a haruki murakami book so it might be similar in its sensibilities. I remember really wanting to read the book after stumbling onto it but forgot to jot down relevant information. The hardcover book cover is a black and white photo of a blonde/brunette woman wearing sunglasses looking directly at the reader. The photo is a little bit like a classic hepburn pose especially with the sunglasses. I'm guessing it must been a novel or maybe even nonfiction novel about a socialite or something Hope I get lucky that someone recognizes it. I know i would be able to identify the book by its cover too but haven't been able to find the cover image either.

I checked it out of a local library, but cannot find it again. It was published sometime between 2009-2012. Think was a female author, but can't remember for certain. Nonfiction. True story about a young African American man from Chicago, who was falsely accused of participating in the robbery and murder (victim was beaten to death) of a man in his inner city neighborhood. He was held in a Chicago city jail for 3 years without ever being charged with a crime. He was freed when a female attorney visiting a client at the jail heard his story, and agreed to take on his case for free. The crime happened during the late 1990's, I believe. I was telling a relative about this book, and so, so want to give him the title. I've tried searching Google, Amazon, local library catalog, everything, but cannot find it. It's driving me nuts!!!

I read a book a few years ago by a scholar that analyzed Obama's Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech from a rhetorical perspective as it relates to Just War Theory. In the book the author makes several points/observations: - America truly is the world's policeman because no other country has the military might/political dictates to intervene into other countries as frequently as we can/do. - Discusses torture and why it can be so unnerving. He mentions Elaine Scarry and her work on torture. He also mentions Dick Cheney's 1% theory, which, if I remember correctly, says that if there's a 1% chance a terrorist attack could happen, anything is justified to prevent it, namely torture. - The book breaks down Obama's acceptance speech point by point and really analyzes it from Jus ad Bellum to other concept of Just War, and notes the peculiarity of a war-time president receiving a peace award. - This author is very likely a scholar!

There was male and female main characters, probably around 12 or 13 who were friends, I don't think they were siblings. I think that the father may have also been captured under the dome. I remember the kids riding a bike around through the woods and coming to the edge of the dome, but I don't remember what it looked like or if you can see beyond it. I remember that there was a huge section missing from the rest of the town and I think that aliens took this larged domed section of town. I think the kids found a way out of the dome and confronted the aliens in a control room. I don't remember the outcome of the confrontation or if anyone got home. I'm pretty sure the setting was 70's or 80's, but not absolutely positive. I think that's it. I don't remember anything else about it. Eavan, that scene doesn't ring a bell. I don't think there was a romantic connection between the kids, but thanks for the thought. Mike: Thank you so much for the effort, but it wasn't any of those stories.

It was a book on colour - the difference between structural and chemical colour, also stuff about reflectivity, polarization, etc. Physics behind all of that. The book was a paperback, small size (like a normal novel), and pretty short, ~200 pages? Published I think around the 80s give or take a decade. The cover was predominantly bright yellow from what I remember, with a prism on the front. I know these are pretty sketchy details but if someone could help me hunt it down that would be awesome. I'd borrowed it from my previous university's library (found in the physics -> optics section) and would like to have a copy for myself now. It was a bit similar to isbn:048642118X but that wasn't the book, as it had slightly different contents. Just to give you a ballpark idea though. Thanks in advance!

goodreads	2205479	1	James Joyce	2015-08-05T00:00:00Z	Sometime around 12-17 years ago (I believe) I read a book and I've recently tried to remember the name of the author or book and can't. The Author: The author wrote (as I remember) a column for some magazine and these were some of the collected columns. Also, as best I can remember, he had a Jewish surname... though I may be misremembering. The Book: It was a trade paperback collection of small biographies of historical scientists. What I specifically appreciated was the author's ability to treat historical geniuses as geniuses, even when they turned out completely wrong. So some of his subjects were more obscure then the norm. .				
goodreads	2205479	2	Lobstergirl	2015-08-05T00:00:00Z	Was the magazine a science magazine, a literary magazine, a general interest magazine, a history magazine, a political magazine, etc.?

The book was serious as to giving the scientists a fair shake, especially when changes to scientific knowledge could make them seem silly, in retrospect. But it was definitely not stuffy. I remember a relaxed style. The author was one of those guys who wants to make science popular and writes to achieve that, but the technical details weren't very important in this book as it was more about the men, then the work.

I've had this happen once before in a book I was looking for. My memory did not match the suggestion members gave me. It wasn't until I found an illustration from the very old edition that I had read as a child that I was able to put two and two together. That illustration apparently had a greater impact on me, than the text. And I guess the same thing has happened with this poem. Given the fact that the poem is anonymous and probably well known, I doubt there is any way for me to discover the actual book it was published in. There's probably numerous editions. Thanks again, Yvonne. You haven't just solved a mystery for me; the poem really stuck with me, and I'd like to think it contributed to me taking up writing nonsense verse for children in adulthood.	unusable

It was about a father and son (and possibly another male (?) relative) that were flying over the Sierra Nevada (?) mountain range. The plane crashed in to a sheer face of the mountain. One person died (either killed instantly or froze to death?), and another (the dad?) was gravely injured. The son, who had a very deep gash in his lower leg ended up hiking down the mountain side and into the desert where he was rescued.

goodreads	2235591	5	Karen	2015-08-05T00:00:00Z	Yeah, Crazy for the Storm is too recent. I know this was published well before 1995. The son was a young adult/older teen. I'm guessing around 16-17ish? The dad was an executive of some sort, I think. I don't recall who the other passenger in the plane was for sure. Maybe a step mother? From what I remember the plane crash actually happened in the late 70's early 80's, and the passenger plane was state of the art at that time. I also don't recall the intended destination.				
goodreads	2235591	6	Lobstergirl	2015-08-05T00:00:00Z	It sounds so much like the crash that happened to NBC executive Dick Ebersol and his family, although that one happened in 2004. Ebersol was/is married to the actress Susan Saint James. She wasn't on the plane. Ebersol and two of his sons were on the plane; the younger son who was 14 or 15 was killed. The older son managed to get out and drag the father to safety. It happened shortly after takeoff at Montrose Airport in Colorado. The pilot and one flight attendant also died.				
goodreads	2235591	7	Karen	2015-08-05T00:00:00Z	I'm sure there were only 3 people in the plane. The father was the pilot. I don't know if it was a single engine plane or double engine....if it was pilot error or engine trouble that caused the crash. I know they almost made it over the top. They crashed into a shear face and landed on a ledge of some sort just yards from the crest of the mountain. One of the people in the crash was splashed with fuel during the crash (or shortly after), as there was concern about it causing chemical burns and melting the polyester in the clothing. I don't believe the plane caught fire. If it did, it was a small fire and they were able to put it out. They did collect some fuel to use for burning in a fire for warmth. I think they may have used the planes tires as well. It possible that the boy had to hike through snow for part of his trip, but it wasn't for any extensive time period. I remember that the nights were very cold, but it warmed up quite a bit in the day time. It's weird how I can remember details like that but not the title.

Like vintage/Victorian/Edwardian little girls with fairy or butterfly wings, with inspirational messages pasted onto the background. I think the cover had a little girl with wings. I think the title had something to do with puking rainbows or glitter. The artwork inside was all parody, with sarcastic quotes/messages instead of inspirational ones. It was a softcover, bigger than a trade paperback but not huge. I think it cost about $15 USD.

Her father's response was a warning to steer clear of him: Curiosity scibbled the cat, he told her. Nonetheless, Fuller began her strange friendhip with the man she calls K, a white African and veteran of the Rhodesian War. A man of contradictions, K is battle-scarred and work-weathered, a born-again Christian and given to weeping for the failure of his romantic life and the burden of his memories. Driven by K's these memories of the war, they decide to enter the heart of darkness in the most literal way, by travelling from Zambia through Zimbabwe and Mozambique to visit the scenes of the war and to meet other veterans. The result is a remarkably unbiased and unsentimental glimpse of life in Africa.	solved / confirmed	Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier	113934	by Alexandra Fuller

I believe the author of this book was a psychologist or some kind of therapist who wrote books based on their actual patients. It was a young adult book. The girl in the story does not talk and the teacher seemed like she was on a mission to get her to open up. The girl eventually attaches to her and stays after school and spends time (the teacher) in a little room. The girl screams bloody murder and didn't think anyone could hear.. like a soundproof room. The girl was upset by that. The teacher brings in an old school video camera and the girl strangely knows how to work it. The teacher seems to think there is the possibility that the girl is being sexually abused by her father. The girl has 3 or 4 younger sisters.

I picked up this book at a library when I was around 11 on the history of the destruction of books (i don't think that is its actual title) anyways it is a non fiction book by this guy who grew up in the middle east. in the introduction he talks about the destruction of libraries in the middle east by bombs and war and stuff. I think it was either iraq or iran where he grew up. I need this book for a research project so if anyone knows of it and could tell me what it is called that would be awesome! Thanks!	unsolved

I think at one point she was watching a webcam and somebody got murdered (idk why, but toothpicks are coming to mind ... potential murder weapon I think?) While she was home someone breaks in and she hides under a car and they don't find her I remember a pink jacket ?? She takes something that belonged to her father that was important (floppy disk?) and takes a car and drives off somewhere. I think she pretends to be a college student and uses the library to open the file.

For each of the blank spaces you were prompted to fill it in with something like, a country, a fruit, a prison, a singer, etc., then you read back the story with the suggestions entered.

About a husband who took his wife and daughter from I think the US to his own middle East country., NOT the one called Not Without My Daughter, but a similar one. They are held captive and cannot escape. Wife pretends to settle down hoping to gain some feeedom to make escape attempt. She has another daughter and this proves problematic as she does not have a birth certificate for this baby so cannot get a passport. She is told to leave the younger child behind and go home with her eldest daughter whom she has papers for. She is told she cannot prove the younger child is her daughter. She says she would not fight so hard if she wasn't her daughter and tells the official, """"it is precisely because she is my daughter that I will not leave without her."""" She manages to get paperwork for the youngest and books herself and children on a flight out. The night before leaving she pretends to be loving towards her abusive husband and prepares a meal, keeps him up late and allows him to make love to her so he will sleep late the following morning and not notice they are gone till she is on the plane. She succeeds in getting herself and both children back home. Hope this information helps. Thank you."

goodreads	12054561	1	Rem	2015-08-05T00:00:00Z	This book is about the generation of young American men in their twenties and thirties. The author, who I think is a psychologist, mentions the movie 'Failure to Launch' with Matthew McConaughey, so it must have been published in 2006 or later.

It was written by someone who was from New England, though I cannot remember which part. It was published in the mid 1980's I think. It is his memoir of coming out as a gay man. I think one of his parents may have been Jewish. I believe he went to a boarding school as well, some point in the story. Also I remember that he had a relationship with an older man, and had a very difficult time telling his parents about it. I have had trouble finding it again.

goodreads	17058520	1	CJ	2015-08-05T00:00:00Z	It's been driving me crazy for years, so I'm finally asking for help! Years ago, I checked out a book from my university library. It was fairly thick and contained lots of black and white photos. The essence of the book was that two educated young women were traveling around the country (in a van?), interviewing average people and just having conversations with people from all walks of life. I think it had a political bent, the gist was that despite the red state/blue state divide, we have more in common than we think and we all essentially want the same things. I remember being very taken by this book when I was younger. I seem to remember that it was pretty new, I don't think it would have been written any later than the mid to late 90s, maybe even 2000 or 2001. I've tried searching for it a few times over the years with no luck. Any leads would be much appreciated!

The book also details her arrival back in Australia and bringing the man too. Some parts I remember are: Her buying clothes from a shop and wearing them while people stared at her - realising she is wearing undergarments. She describes living in a shack like house and talks about the monsoon season. She talks about going to the hospital for check-ups during her pregnancy. Don't have any memory of the author or title or cover and I have no idea if the book was old or new when I read it :( Thanks for reading, I've already tried different keywords in google. I hope someone out there can help Edit: It's NOT about a woman trying to find herself, or going on adventures. She doesn't packpack.

I am looking for this book that has the Chili recipe on it that uses white beans, turkey and is colored white since it does not use tomato sauce or tomatoes in it, there are other good recipes that are good for people who are watching what they eat as well. It's like one of those skinny books but I don't remember if it had skinny on the title. It might be a long shot asking here but I hope someone out there knows what I am talking about. Thank you for reading! =)

goodreads	17506732	1	Rem	2015-08-05T00:00:00Z	This was a book I received back in 2005 or 2006. It is a memoir, and i think it may have been published between 2003 and 2006. It was written by a motivational speaker who used to be a surfer back in the mid 1990s.I believe he was surfing in Malibu, CA when he had his accident. The author had dark blond hair, and in his story he was engaged at the time of his accident, and I think he had a younger brother. His accident caused him to be wheel chair bound. Also, I think he was a Christian, and the book cover was white with a picture of him in a wheel chair, in a tan colored suit perhaps and smiling. I'm pretty sure that he ends up marrying his fiance, and I think his accident happened around 1996. I think his name may have been Matthew. THE man is not Christian Bailey and I have had a very difficult time finding this book. For some reason I thought it might be called 'Live your life to the fullest' or something similar.

goodreads	17515888	1	Jeff	2016-06-27T00:00:00Z	I listen to a lot of audiobooks, and want to find a particular story I really enjoyed. My family and I listened to collections of horror/suspense short stories on road trips, and there was a particular short story that I'm trying to remember. This particular story seems like something in a Stephen King collection, but I cannot find it. The plot: there are two robbers who rob a pharmacy, or grocery store, or something along those lines. The robbery goes wrong, and one of the robbers ends up shooting somebody, so they grab a hostage. The two robbers take the hostage and drive to an unoccupied house while trying to avoid the police. The hostage slowly builds a relationship with the robbers, and eventually earns their trust. The climax of the story: the hostage persuades the robbers into letting him go outside (can't remember why). IIRC, the hostage turns out to be a talented salesman. Just as the hostage gets outside, a police cruiser turns up the street, and the two robbers think the hostage is about to get away. However, the hostage hides behind a bush, and once the police cruiser is past, the hostage goes back into the house, much to the relief of the robbers. [Spoilers ahead] The robbers thusly let their guard down, and the hostage quickly turns on them and ties them up. It's revealed that the hostage is related to the person murdered in the beginning of the story. It ends with the hostage telling the robbers that he didn't want to get away and now how he is going to torture them. I remember a lot of details, but not the name or author. If anybody knows this novella or the collection of stories to which it belongs, I'd be very grateful! Thank you!	unusable			audiobook

I remember reading this short story in a high school English class, so it would have been the early '00s that I read it. The story was about a kid who was driving, I believe s/he (I don't remember the gender of the main character, or honestly even if it was told in first or third person though I *believe* it was third) was taking the test to get a license. S/he ends up in a car accident and kills folks that were in the other car. I do remember specifically that the driver that caused the accident noticed that the other car had a sleeping child in it before the accident happened. Fortunately for the driver (view spoiler) [""""it was all a dream"""" - basically, the people who administer the drivers test had a hallucination part of the test where anyone attempting to get their driver's license went through this experience of causing a fatal accident. The kid, realizing it hadn't really happened, tried to proceed with getting his/her license, at which point the licensing folks stopped him/her (and, if I remember correctly, took him/her away to a jail or a hospital or something) because anyone who could experience causing a fatal accident like that and then be emotionally okay with having a license handed to them clearly had major issues and shouldn't be allowed to have a driver's license (hide spoiler)] . It was a sort of a Catch-22 situation, I guess. Any ideas? I feel like it's probably a really obvious story, one easy to figure out (again, we read it in English class, the same year we read """"A Modest Proposal"""" and """"The Lady or the Tiger?"""" which are relatively common, and I'm pretty sure it was in our textbook as those two were and not just a print-out so it was probably widely read), but I have done a bit of Googling to no avail."	unusable			looking for a short story

goodreads	17594927	1	Kathryn	2016-08-05T00:00:00Z	I read a book about 8 to 10 years ago that was a cross between an autobiography and a travel book. I would have found it through looking for travel books at the time. It was written by a woman who had been a writer (maybe for womens magazines) in the UK. She married a man who had a job for the embassy and followed him all over the world. At one point they were some place in the Caribbean and the husband breaks both legs jumping out of a window. They also lived in Africa somewhere and I think the book ends with them in one of the stans. Their kids go to boarding school back in the UK and sometimes get in trouble. I can't recall anything about the cover or when it might have been written. Thanks for any help in advance.

They had interviewed lots of people who had either been dumped or dumped their partner. In the book there were excerpts from the anonymised interview transcripts, which were organised by theme, e.g. the first chapter was about """"moments when people realised things were starting to go wrong"""" all the way through to the aftermath of the breakup. A common theme was that one partner usually gets dissatisfied first and does not immediately tell the other person, so it is often a shock when they actually confront their partner.

I remember the beginning and the end relatively well. The main character is a boy, pre-teen or teen. He is a social outcast and lives in the rural mountains. I remember specifically that he had treasures such as a bug preserved in amber and a gold leaf skeleton. At some point he discovers a nugget that turns out to be gold, but he doesn't like it particularly (the leaf is more beautiful and delicate). Protagonist is bullied. Near the end he is hiding in a cave with an underwater river. The main antagonist of the book comes up to the mouth of the cave. I believe the antagonist's horse had 3 black hooves and 1 white. The antagonist is after him because he believes the boy knows where to obtain more gold. The antagonist tries to swim up the underwater river and he gets stuck and drowns. Thank you in advance!

This is a non-fiction, seemed to be aimed at being an interesting read for those who wonder what millionaires' lives were like before they became rich/famous/did-their-thing. And basically the book's mood/intention seemed to have been to put in question the popular notion that the famous now-successful people """"started with nothing"""" or pushed sheer determination to super-human levels and explore what they might have indirectly had that could have been key to their success. Author would review the facts about environments and conditions some successful people had lived in and were exposed to before (and in some cases way before) they made their successes. So, a bit of a nature-or-nurture exploration. The individuals' biographical snippets were reviewed individually - either in chapters or otherwise, but i remember Bill Gates' middle school or high school years being discussed in detail. His parents' ownership(?) of a business of mainframe computer time rentals to companies and schools and such, and Bill's having access to these things. Author would point to how those conditions and events were outside of Bill's control and would make further explorations with other environments and other successful people in the book.

I think the time periods were divided into sections. I don't think there was a discussion of the individual poets, only their names and dates of birth and death. The oldest poems included several by Burns. (No Bible.) It had the classics: Shakespeare, Milton, Tennyson, Keats, etc. I'm not as interested in the modern ones, but I know it went at least to GM Hopkins, TS Eliot and WC Williams.

I think part of the getting ready for winter involved berry picking. It had a green cover. Read this in the 1980s, so my memory is a bit fuzzy.

A series of mishaps due partly to poor planning and an almost complete lack of appropriate knowledge about the land, cars, survival, meant that all or most of the travellers died. Awful, fabulous story; well-written. Not being able to remember the title has been driving me crazy for over 10 years. Help me stop the madness :D

goodreads	17997247	1	Mimi	2016-08-05T00:00:00Z	So what I remember is: a girl(a made up character by the author), attends Hogwarts during Harry's time but ends up time travelling to the Marauders era. She is accidentally sent there by Lupin, I think. Anyway, she ends up becoming great friends with them. ...SPOILER ALERT.... She falls in love with Lupin and at the end returns to her correct time, and realises Lupin is the boy she fell in love with in the past. I don't really remember what happened but Lupin ends up dying to save her.

goodreads	18010678	9	Angela	2016-08-05T00:00:00Z	Overall tone was funny and suspenseful; could be considered chick lit, because I'm not sure any man could relate to the dreaded pantyhose malfunction. My recollection is that the crime was the owner of a manufacturing company that was the town's biggest employer. I think they were not properly disposing of waste, damaging the local environment. The husband of the protagonist had just begun working for said manufacturer. I'm not sure if it was a stand alone or not.

It's considered a classic of cultural criticism among folks who specialize in such things, and was written in the middle 20th century by--I THINK--an English author (might have been American). It dealt extensively, but not exclusively, with art. It's an account of Western decline from c. 1900 to the author's present (c. 1950-70?). Its early chapters have a lot to say about the cultural dislocations that WWI brought, and keep returning to Yeats's """"Second Coming."""" One of the middle chapters is pretty hard on Dada and its aftereffects, and is particularly scornful (at length) about Duchamp's """"Ãtant donnÃ©s."""" The book as a whole charts a kind of downward arrow of crisis for modern culture. AUTHORS THAT IT DEFINITELY ISN'T B/C I ALREADY KNOW THEIR STUFF: It's not Barzun, Steiner, Lasch, Trilling, Bloom, or Postman (the last two are too recent anyway), even though the book touches upon a lot of those authors' major concerns."

goodreads	18022026	1	Karen	2016-06-27T00:00:00Z	I read this story in 6th grade and I'm almost 25 now so it was about 15 years ago. It was a short sci-fi story in a collection of short stories. The story is about some people traveling to a distant place (like a planet or something) in space in a giant space ship. The ship is run by the people on it. There are two shifts on the ship. A night shift and a day shift, so to speak. The night shift and the day shift people never interact because they are pretty much awake during different times of the day. Actually, I think it was against ship rules to talk to each other. The night shift and the day shift people share the same rooms because when the night shift person was working, the day shift person was sleeping and vice versa, but there was never any trace that the other person used the same room because the ship's cleaning system made sure of it. The story was about a guy that becomes interested in the other person that uses his room when he is awake and working. I think he somehow figures out it's a woman. They somehow start leaving each other little hints in the room that the ship's cleaning service can't find. One way, I remember was when the woman leaves a note for him in the sink's faucet. She stuck it up the faucet hole and it was pushed out when he turned on the water. The notes says the name of a book and when he goes look for the book in the ship's library he finds other clues etc. They started to feel like they wanted to meet each other but they couldn't. In the end, he switches from the night shift to the day shift because one day the ship managers were asking for a volunteer to switch to the day shift because they were short on workers for something and the guy volunteers even if it meant pretty much leaving behind his night shift life behind and never seeing those people again. It's was kind of eerie but so interesting! I would love to read it again, so if anyone knows the name please tell me!!!	unusable

goodreads	18089853	1	Wolf Forrest	2016-08-05T00:00:00Z	I need help. I had a book as a child, and would desperately like to find it again. It was a natural history book. I can't remember the title or author. This is from the late 1950s. The book was divided into sections: Insects, birds, fish, mammals, reptiles and amphibians, trees, flowers, and minerals. It was a large book. It had two entries per page. One entry on the top half, the other on the bottom half. Each entry was divided vertically into text and illustration, and was checkerboarded--that is, if the top entry had illo on the left and text on the right, the bottom entry would have text on the left and illo on the right. I loved this book--the illustrations were beautiful and evocative-- and miss having it in my library. A reward will be given to anyone who can assist.

It's a bit tricky because, for example, searching """"natural history"""" on books from 1950-1960 brings up 9,100 print books, including things like Pliny's Natural History - so it's using the pub. year of that edition, rather than the original publication date. http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=kw%3...

The book in question deals with rhetoric, it's in English, of course, and it looks somewhat like George Yule's The Study of English and that type of publications. The problem, however, is the fact that I only read a chapter of it which I needed for my research, and never took a look at the front page, hence I don't have the slightest idea what it's called, who wrote it and what color it is. I only vaguely remember that its title wasn't very specific. By this I mean that it may have been something formulaic like """"the study of"""", """"a coursebook of"""", etc. The best I can do is to put up some quotes. I was dealing with fallacies so I wrote down some definitions and the numbers of the pages they appear on so that may help. For instance, on page 166 the book talks about Overgeneralizing and defines it as """"drawing a larger conclusion than the evidence supports"""". Or, on page 173 it talks about Guilt by Association and defines it as """"an assumption that you are like those you associate with"""". Or, page 175, Plain folks, """"an appeal that implies you should follow the ordinary citizen, the man in the street, the simple folk"""". I would immensely appreciate any help. Thanks"

Her best friend Page goes into their bathroom every time she comes over and eats toothpaste. It was a funny book and I regret giving it away after I read it. I know this is a shot in the dark because I cannot remember anything more.

goodreads	18110757	3	Sam (Rescue Dog Mom, Writer, Hugger)	2016-08-05T00:00:00Z	Hi Tab, I'm trying very hard to remember. I'm very sorry I can't think of the time period, perhaps the 60's or 70's? I believe she had a younger brother between 5 and 7. Her Dad worked business hours and her Mom managed the home. The cover was white and it had a crayon-drawn little girl in a dancing position, one leg kicked back and both arms in the air. I do remember the print being smaller than the other Scholastic books I bought in the fourth grade.

I do remember that it was about an African-American/Black woman and her life growing up. It may have taken place in the '60s-80s, and may have been published in the '90s. It is somewhat of a coming of age story, as it chronicles a bit of her childhood (how she experimented with smoking cigarettes) and her college life. I believe she went on to be a motivational speaker, as she was at a podium on the cover of the book (if my memory serves me correctly). The cover is a green color (aside from the photo of her on the front). She is a light-skinned woman. Other details: she mentioned that she was friends with a Caucasian woman in college and they ended up being married to the same man, who was also Caucasian, but at different times. Her name may be Charlene, Charlotte, Cheryl or something like that. Please help. Thanks.

A girl named Jerry and her brothers lose their mother to a house fire and are taken in by their abusive grandmother, who mistreats them while lavishing her love on another child, Alice. Once they get taken out of her care, they get placed in foster homes. At one point, Jerry graduates from school with the surname Zigga and tries to get her life together, and that Alice becomes a stoner. I also remember that Jerry had a cleft palate. Unfortunately, that's about all I know about it. I wish I could provide more information, but it was so long ago.

It was set in America. It wouldâve been new at the time. Itâs not Working (Studs Terkel) and itâs not Gig (John Bowe). This collection seemed to specifically focus on jobs that really; really suck; and had definitely more of a humor vibe to it I remember it having an orange cover. Segments I remember: Somebody writing pulp/dirty books. They commented that they got paid by the word; and nobody really did any editing; so theyâd just go overboard on the adjectives. And they had to do it on a manual; old school typewriter that didnât work very well. Something about working in an ice cream parlor and how hard it was to scoop ice cream. I think they said something about the ice creams that had extra ingredients (nuts; bubble gum; cookies) were the hardest. Another: Somebody was a customer service rep (MAYBE a telemarketer) and sheâd file her nails while on calls. Anytime somebody started being a jerk ; sheâd pantomime slitting her wrists with the nail file. It was kinda short in length and paperback.

The book is a comparison of early gods and creation myths, together with some other comparative literature of early writings. It's quite interesting. The title is strange, so if you know this book, it should come to mind... It's called something like Zarathaxyon, or Xymaxion, or Zoroaxymia. Those are all probably quite wrong, but the title has that flavor. I've tried searching several catalogs and indexes for different combinations like this without finding anything. I checked this out of a university library around 2007 (I did try searching the catalog there). I'm not sure when it was published. If you know that comparative mythology book with the crazy title, please help!				
goodreads	18203075	2	Abigail	2016-08-05T00:00:00Z	Could the title have been something about Zoroastrianism or its founder Zoroaster? (Zoroaster has several spelling/transliteration variants, as well, including Zarathustra, Zarathushtra, and Zaradusht.)				
goodreads	18203075	3	Lomendil	2016-08-05T00:00:00Z	The title was very reminiscent of Zarathustra/Zoroaster; I was meaning to imply that with my title guesses, but I should have been more explicit. I remember it being most similar to Zarathustra, but had some letter combinations that I had never seen in a transliteration before. Thank you for your reply!				
goodreads	18203075	4	Kris	2016-08-05T00:00:00Z	Lomendil, which cultures/countries/time periods were compared? Were all the myths about creation? Any chance the creation myths are from a single cultural group? For example: Watunna: An Orinoco Creation Cycle by Marc; de Civrieux ?				
goodreads	18203075	5	Lomendil	2016-08-05T00:00:00Z	"Hi Kris, good questions. There was a healthy chunk of native american legend, but there were other groups as well. There were several sections of the book, not all of them about creation myths. That is what sticks in my mind the most, since a lot of time was spent detailing legends that involve a bird diving into water and bringing up mud to make the land. That theme was identified across several cultural groups. I'm pretty sure there was also a section on shamanism. The book was more about the cross-cultural narratives than anything trying to make connections in a spooky """"maya factor"""" kind of way (in case it's starting to sound like that)."

Thanks, @Rainbowheart!	confirmed			
goodreads	18216834	1	Adele	2016-08-05T00:00:00Z	I read a rather unusual book in the 1980's (definitely by 1991 at the latest) that seemed relatively new at the time (or possibly 1970's at the earliest). The book had multiple chapters, each one focused on a different activity involving heat. I got the impression the author(s) (one male and possibly a second female author?) either regularly did these things or talked to people who did them regularly and tried them out. In particular, I remember a whole chapter about sunbathing that went into detail about the meditative aspects of sunbathing and something about the sunlight shining on your closed eyelids. There was another chapter all about hot tubs that talked about ways to kind of shock the system by sitting in a hot tub for a period of time and then plunging into cool water - or even a snow drift - I definitely remember that! I believe there was a chapter on saunas (maybe with instructions for how to build your own?). There might have been a chapter on sweat lodges and there were lots of other chapters I'm forgetting. Does this sound familiar to anyone?

When I think about the part where I thought there might have been how to build your own sauna I seem to recall illustrations like you would see in an instruction manual. I don't remember if heat was actually in the title, but the concept or theme was definitely heat and not just energy in general. Thanks for asking questions and prompting more details.

goodreads	18221035	1	Liralen	2016-08-05T00:00:00Z	I recently (within the last year) read a firefighter's memoir in which said firefighter describes going on an ocean rescue (general rescue-related; there was no fire) to save a man who had swum out to sea to kill himself. The writer describes the man as being completely emotionless when saved, I think. I'm looking for that specific passage/section in the book. This is a slightly unorthodox request for this group, as I'm pretty sure it's either Fighting Fire or Working Fire . I thought it was the former, but I've just re-checked it out from the library and paged through three times to no avail, and I no longer have Working Fire -- so I'm hoping that 1) somebody who's read Working Fire (or understands how to search for such passages on the Internet better than I do) can confirm the scene before I try to track down a new copy, 2) somebody recognises it from Fighting Fire and can point me in the right direction; or 3) somebody can say, 'no, you fool, it's this other book on your shelves'. I do think the latter's unlikely (am pretty sure the book was by a firefighter, and those are the only two I've read of late), but I'm open to suggestions. Thank you!

It had several stories: one was about the murder of Steve Biko in South Africa (also included a black and white photograph of him), a story about a little boy in Uruguay being abducted from the street by police while out riding his bike (he was beaten to death I believe), one story about a man whose government experimented on him and left him practically a vegetable (think it was somewhere like the Soviet Union or the Ukraine but not sure), and one story about a woman either in the Sudan or an Asian country being illegally detained for months/years without a trial.

As soon as I read the book description, I remembered everything about the murders and how terrible they were. Very good book for anyone interested in the victim's story.

The game is a tabletop rpg / choose your adventure type story. The girl introduces herself as the """"dungeon master"""" and wants to only be called that and not her real name when they play. The game they play is fantasy with monsters and dungeons in it. I specifically remember a part where she makes him choose between two doors/hallways in a dungeon.

goodreads	18296008	1	RJ	2017-08-05T00:00:00Z	Hi! I am searching for a book that I had read to me as a child. I can't recall the name of the book and after much Googling, I am still no closer to finding any results. I am 30 years, from Australia. I have checked all databases recommend by Loganberry Books. The storyline went as follows - A little girl woke up on 'the wrong side of the bed'. She went about her day to day tasks only to find that everything went wrong and she felt generally irritable. Toward the end of the book she goes back to bed and literally gets out of the other side of the bed and is in a better mood. I distinctly remember that the main character was a little girl, there was a scene where she was in brushing her teeth and I think she may have worn striped PJs. This book was an older book, my best guess is 1960s based on the illustrations. Anyway, I can tell you that the book is definitely NOT 'Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day' and from memory the book illustrations were blue and orange (illustrations were sort of done using a painted effect for lack of better description) only which tells me the book was most likely released published anywhere from the 1950s - early 1980s. It was not a Golden Book. I have searched on world cat and other such sites and it is NONE of the books that come up in the results. PLEASE HELP! None of the books 'The Wrong Side of the Bed' that I have found have been the right book. Please help me!	unusable

The little girl pictured in the soft, well-drawn illustrations wakes up with good intentions but all day -- at home, at school and after school-she can't seem to put a foot right. Every small disaster, from spilled milk to tardiness, is greeted with a frown, right up to bedtime. But, """"Mother and Daddy and Big Sister Louisa come to say goodnight, Mother tucks you in tight... and hugs you tight."""" The book is an earnest effort at reassurance. The use of """"You"""" invites immediate identification that only sensitive children raised in gentle circumstances will be able to give. There seem to be a number of children who would find a day of frowns easy to bear, even a relief -- if they noticed them at all. An indirect and humorous approach to those familiar bad days was effectively offered in Russell Hoban's recent The Sorely Trying Day (p. 361, J-115).""""

Here is a review from Publisher's Weekly: Anxious about her first day at a new school, a girl named Kate opens her eyes to an overcast, gray-green morning and grumpily gets up on the wrong side of bed. All her new clothes are missing, so she has to wear a ``dirty old skirt,'' mismatched shirt and baggy socks. She proceeds (late, of course) to a gloomy school that resembles a dungeon, and she enters a book-free classroom ruled by an ill-tempered gorilla. As for the cafeteria, the title indicates what's on the menu. Simon (The Topsy-Turvies) and Coplans (Cat and Dog) exaggerate the absurdity, lessening the tension with nutty scenarios: the gorilla-teacher, adorned in a pearl necklace, reads herself a comic-book romance called Going Ape. The author also resolves the situation with ease. Kate jumps back in bed and, when she reawakens, gets out of the right side of bed. This time she finds a sunny morning, a restored wardrobe and a welcoming elementary school.	unusable

It was a hardbound book, fairly thick, and did not have a dust jacket . It was gray and the front had a black sketch of the Phantom of the Opera. I believe it had been published sometime in the late '70s. Sound familiar to anyone?

What age group was this book aimed at--teens in an effort to interest them in the sciences, NA, Adults? Microbe Hunters is the first one that comes to my mind, (and the one I linked to is a re-issue, so it really is much older than the date listed.) Another thought is Microbe Hunters: Then and Now I remember reading both for a college chemistry class back in the mid to late 70's.	solved	Microbe hunters, then and now	10521444	edited by Hilary Koprowski and Michael B.

The plot was this young girl and her family get some land from the government in Colorado I think it was for the homestead act. They move out there to the middle of nowhere on the Colorado plains. They grow broomcorn. The winters are really really harsh. They have some kind of weirdo neighbor. I think they lived in a sod house or some kind of dwelling that was built kinda underground. I believe the author was a female. If you think you may know please let me know.

goodreads	18382702	4	Lydia	2017-08-05T00:00:00Z	It seems like little house on the prairie but it is definitely not. But thank you for your responses!				
goodreads	18382702	5	Melanti	2017-08-05T00:00:00Z	If it's built partially underground, I think the proper term is dugout. They usually were dug partially into the ground with sod finishing the top. Willa Cather is another big name when it comes to homesteading on the prairie - though that's Nebraska, not Colorado. I seem to remember there being dugouts and corn in My Ãntonia . And, of course, Ãntonia's family are somewhat strange neighbors - being Bohemian and the older ones unable to speak English.				
goodreads	18382702	6	Lydia	2017-08-05T00:00:00Z	It was thinking it may have not been Colorado. It could have been some other plains area. And yes I think dugout is the correct term. Thanks!

goodreads	18382702	10	Lydia	2017-08-05T00:00:00Z	Hi I am not sure if that is it. But it's definitely onto something. I feel like I have read this book before though. Let me think. My book had a mother who was really bored and wanted to make a friend and she met a neighbor lady she thought they could befriend each other. The family was really poor they often cooked some kind of flour bread or something. I'm the end they moved to some other place I think maybe the grandparents house.				
goodreads	18382702	11	Melanti	2017-08-05T00:00:00Z	With those added details, it doesn't seem as likely. I think the main character lived with an Aunt or Grandparent or such, not a mother. And Antonia's mother was a little too busy to worry about friendships too much. Both the being poor and cooking bread is true - especially for Antonia's family - but those are probably really common plot elements in stories of this type. The main character's family does move partway through the book - but it's just into town, not far away. And at the end, the kid grows up enough to go away to college. So, most of it sort of fits, but not exactly. If you want to glance through a few pages to see if it rings a bell, you can read it here. http://www.gutenberg.org/files/242/24...

I may actually have two different stories that are similar mixed up in my mind but I truly think it is one story. Although there have been several suggestions that seem like it. And one may have been it but my memory is foggy. (It was read during a stressful time in my life) Ok so here is what I remember: set in the early 1900's in I think the plains of Colorado. A young child and family get offered land from the government in return for crops or something. The family was supposed to make something of the land. It was like 170 acres or something. They pack up to travel there and the wife wanted to take the piano. I believe they figured out how to get it there. When they get there they are greeted by Grandpa. It's a house that is built underground. One little room. A small bed and a stove. The piano gets in there I think. I also think at some point the piano was sold. There were two was out. There was a barn in the distance. Something happens in the barn. The winters are really tough. The family grows broomcorn. There is a neighbor that the kids are told to watch for he is creepy. The girl of the family goes to this mans house. The mother is lonely and wants a friend. She finds a nice family up the street. The whole family goes out for dinner one night to these people we home. The mother goes out of her way to buy the children proper clothing. The grandparents live by some creek on some slope of a hill. Eventually because life is too hard on the plains with the snowy, windy winters they move to the grandparents old home or something like that. It was near some Rocky ditch or something and the kids went exploring in it. That's all I got folks. Any help at all is much appreciated. Thanks for reading this!!!!

I'm fairly sure I read it in the past three or four years, and forgive my scattered memory. It focused on how declaring someone insane/committing them could be used as a way to force issues of property/gain control over funds. It possibly opened with a case about a mother trying to have her son committed to gain access to his money. (I can't remember if he wasn't giving it to her, or if she just disapproved, but I think he was generally a cranky/slightly odd person, and a business man. This was very early in the book, at least) A lot of it focused on men, though some discussion was on women. (For some reason, I thought Caroline Norton was brought up, but I think it was another estranged-from-her-awful-husband woman novelist, one who wrote in response to said awful marriage. Charles Dickens was involved somehow, and I really want to remember the details!)	unsolved

goodreads	18401246	1	Jane Meredith	2017-08-05T00:00:00Z	This is a non-fiction book in the self-help/personal development genre. It describes different types of relationship that people develop, such as a garden relationship, where people tend, prune and plant actively within the relationship, never having the view that things are fixed or final (for example). It has chapters for different types of relationship - at least 10 and maybe up to 20. I can't remember the other types, but things like -the Adventure relationship, the Sports relationship, the Journey relationship ... I read it about 10 years ago, at least. It belonged to someone I knew, who later moved and I don't know how new it was then - but also, it wasn't ancient. This was in Australia but I don't especially think it was an Australian author (though I guess it could have been). Maybe it was by a man- ?? It was a paperback. The writing had a fresh immediacy, a vibrancy about it. I seem to remember it had some kind of artwork on the cover, not a photograph of people or scenery, more abstract/stylised.

goodreads	18405410	30	Michael Watson	2025-04-27T00:00:00Z	"Success! The book is indeed Sean Stewart's """"The Night Watch"""", as suggested some while back by Mely. Mely had suggested The Night Watch by Sean Stewart back in July of 2024. When I read descriptions of the book, it didn't ring any bells for me...but Mely followed up in March, with a couple of quotes, and suggested that I might have mixed up some of what I thought I remembered with another book. And Orsolya Konyvtaros provided a couple more. The similarities were so pronounced that I figured they almost had to be right. So I went online and located a used copy. And it turns out that I had forgotten almost all of the major plot points of the book, and remembered little more than the few quotes that I originally mentioned. It's a great pleasure to be re-reading it now (I'm currently about 2/3 of the way through it). I've also discovered that this is the second in a series of three books that broadly share the same setting: a world in which magic, manifested mainly by gods, monsters, and ghosts, began to seep back into the world after the second world war. Many thanks for the suggestions posted by other readers. Very pleased to have finally found this one!"	confirmed

It was published in paperback. Plot description: took place in a world with roughly World War 1-era technology, but the supernatural was real. A longstanding war had killed many, and their ghosts haunted a neighborhood across the river from the living population, who carefully avoided the haunted area. The ghosts suffered terribly from unrelenting cold, and the only thing that gave them a moment's relief was if their children or grandchildren lit a ceremonial fire for them. I believe that the protagonists were of Chinese or mixed Chinese-Western descent. One of the characters was the adult or near-adult orphaned son of a dead soldier, who resented his father's absence until a sage told him his father was haunting the attic of a house across the river, and that """"He is very cold."""" Another character was a woman who was obsessed with painting - she fancied herself an artist, and cared about nothing else. Toward the end of the story, she gave birth to a daughter, whose name, as I remember it, was """"Lark-Rises-Singing"""", and for whom she had little time as she was too busy painting. The final words in the story described how the little girl's nanny peeked into a supernatural book on the history of the world's greatest artists, capable of describing even great artists who had not yet been born, and seeing the entry """"Daughter of an unnamed soldier and a talented amateur, Lark-Rises-Singing"""" came late to art, after a troubled childhood."""" She didn't tell the mother, as this would have bruised the mom's aspirations to be a great artist."

""""Sabriel is sent as a child across the Wall to the safety of a school in Ancelstierre. Away from magic; away from the Dead. After receiving a cryptic message from her father, 18-year-old Sabriel leaves her ordinary school and returns across the Wall into the Old Kingdom. Fraught with peril and deadly trickery, her journey takes her to a world filled with parasitical spirits, Mordicants, and Shadow Hands -- for her father is none other than The Abhorson. His task is to lay the disturbed dead back to rest. This obliges him -- and now Sabriel, who has taken on her father's title and duties -- to slip over the border into the icy river of Death, sometimes battling the evil forces that lurk there, waiting for an opportunity to escape into the realm of the living. Desperate to find her father, and grimly determined to help save the Old Kingdom from destruction by the horrible forces of the evil undead, Sabriel endures almost impossible challenges whilst discovering her own supernatural abilities -- and her destiny."""""

It's an alternative version of earth, I think, not our world. Technology is similar to that of 1910 - 1918, but ghosts are quite real. The only fantastical creatures I remember are the ghosts.

He found his grandfather seated with his friends, with a cup of tea before himâbut only the grandfather had any. The tea smelled of almonds, the implication being that it was laced with cyanide, and grandfather had been about to poison himself. Instead, he put aside the tea and left with his grandson to deal with the problem.

With little knowledge and no special tools, the men of Bomb Disposal took their lives in their hands every time they unearthed and dismantled delayed action bombs designed with fiendish ingenuity and variety to detonate when tampered with. As fast as super-human gallantry revealed the intricacies of a new mechanism the pattern changed ; booby trap was added to booby trap ; the casualties were numerous and crippling, for the most highly skilled were the inevitable victims. But the cold-blooded bravery of the men who volunteered confounded the worst that German science could devise.	solved	Unexploded Bomb: A History of Bomb Disposal in World War II	10147939	by Major A. B. Hartley
goodreads	18407261	1	Peter Meilinger	2017-08-05T00:00:00Z	"A few years back I was weeding my library's nonfiction collection and had to get rid of an old, beat up book that looked pretty interesting. I thought I'd made a list of all the interesting books I recycled, but I can't find this one. Here's what I remember. It was about a group of young men who were tasked with dealing with unexploded ordinance in England in World War II. If the Germans dropped a bomb and it didn't go off, or if a mine broke loose and floated to the shore, someone had to figure out how to dismantle it without blowing themselves up. The author and his fellows were one group of those someones. I think the author wasn't English himself, but was a British citizen. Canadian or Australian, perhaps. I could be wrong. The book was written after the war, probably in the 50s or 60s given its appearance and condition. It was a hardcover, but not as big as most. Maybe a little smaller than the large paperbacks we see these days. I know they were figuring things out as they went. When they encountered a new type of explosive they had to carefully dismantle it while taking notes the whole time so it wouldn't be so nerve-wracking the next time. Assuming they and/or their notes survived, of course. There was one anecdote about trying to disarm a bomb or mine that was partially submerged in the harbor of a good sized town. I believe they could only work on it during low tide. It took them awhile to do everything they could and they had warned the populace to leave their windows open to keep them from breaking if and when the bomb exploded. They finally were forced to deliberately set off the bomb, and a lot of windows were broken because people had closed them to keep out the chill. They got a lot of complaints, to which their response was basically """"We told you to leave the windows open!"""" Reading between the lines I figured the actual response included a lot of unprintable words. Ring any bells for anyone?"

Both featured their set, Central Asia, possibly multiple nations in the region where the author spent some time in his late teens to early twenties. The author is an American White Male who was initially an aid worker when he first travelled there but am not confident about my memories. He (oddly) emphasized in the foreword of both books that he had no knowledge of Russian or local languages of any place he had been to and no prospect of learning in future. Both books were released circa early to mid 00's--2003, 2004.

I checked it out in 2005/06, but can't remember if it was in the new section or already in the stacks. This was written for kids, with projects they could do themselves. It had a very color blocky cover, and the illustrations were all hand drawn and colored in a very bright, graphic way. The font may also have all been in """"handwriting""""; if not the entire book, at least the chapter headings and the like were. I distinctly remember the section of curtains having a project to make a playing card curtain. There was also a project for painting a shower curtain and using it has regular room drapes. There were lots of of other projects, split up by type: curtains, desk/school accessories, random decor, etc. The closest similar cover I can recall would be this edition of The Bell Jar ."

goodreads	18503135	1	Andrea	2017-06-27T00:00:00Z	I cannot remember the author or character names. It was one of the better works by an author who had some so-so m/m romance or erotica work. I've searched amazon and kobo (I orininally read it on Kindle Unlimited). I'm not familiar with any other sources. I've searched goodreads and pored through all pages of works I've rated. I think the author has pulled their work from amazon, and it also doesn't appear I rated it after reading it, so it's not in my ratings. Story highlights that I can remember: Kid lives alone with mother. Summer Teacher moves in across the street. Has long blond hair and surfer persona. Kid and teacher take a trip to the beach and kid kisses adult, adult rejects (not gay). Autumn Teacher teaches at a prep school, so kid is not at same campus as teacher. Teacher is dating a woman. Kid works backstage for school play, makes a friend (girl). Teacher brings his date to play performance. At Christmas, teacher is in love with kid and hit the sheets for the first time. Spring Epilogue or last chapter: HEA has boyfriend (teacher) dropping kid off at college, where his (best friend? roommate?) also has an older boyfriend. It's a little bit coming-of-age, bit of the gay-for-you sub-genre of M/M romance, and just really sweet. I don't hold out a lot of hope for this but it's worth a shot.

It consisted entirely of first-person monologues from residents in a fictional English town, with many characters having more than one monologue interspersed among their neighbors'. It was definitely post-WWII, and probably from the '70s or '80s. Characters included a retired colonial officer missing the lifetime spent abroad from which he retired, and a young man looking to leave town for better opportunities elsewhere, among others.				https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/18504140-solved-nonfiction-consisting-of-1st-person-monologues-from-residents-of

goodreads	18548831	1	Aubrey	2017-08-05T00:00:00Z	"This book was written by a lady who's been with cats all her life. The book is about """"cat culture"""", from the cat's POV. That is, how cats have a culture amongst themselves. The book seemed old when I grabbed it in the library. I don't think it's any newer than 2005, probably much older. It's about nature, it wasn't geared towards kids, but it wasn't explicitly adult either. She talks about the difference in personal space and communication between city-pet cats and country cats. She talks about how tom cats in the country/feral have multiple wives. She calls them wives and husband rather then mates, like most nature books do. She talks about how multiple queens having one husband can protect their kittens from being killed by other toms. She talks about how neutered males can have multiple wives. The queens will have kittens from other males, but the neutered male will protect the kittens from being killed. She also went to Africa at some point. She talks about how leopards are the natural predators of humans, as lions are too big and family oriented to bother with us usually. She mentions a tribe who had more leopard related deaths then lions. But she does compare the differences in behavior towards non-man eating lions and man-eating lions when it comes to safaris. While in Africa, she walks down a road in the savannah and she comes across a leopard. She's scared, but she's more worried about her child/ren down the path. They are camping in tents, I think. So she pushes onwards. The leopard does the leopard equivalent of *ahem* when she keeps walking, which is described as a cough. She stops, pressures forward. The leopard coughs even louder, indicating: """"Hey, I'm lying down on this road. I'm not gonna move, so take a different route."""" However, she's still scared for her kids, she has to be there with them with a leopard nearby. So she keeps walking. The leopard looks at her in surprise, then gets up and walks away. Her kid(s) are fine."

It is, as far as i remember, a true story. Summary: its about an australian woman who decides to go live in india don't remember why. She hangs out learning about the culture and meets people including a tibetan man whom she has a baby with. They then both move to australia to live. Details: - she stays in one or two areas/houses. No moving around or backpacking. She settles. - one of her houses seems like a shack with a tin roof. -She describes living in the same area as the dalai lama. - she talks about the rain season. - she talks about buying a skirt and wearing it in town and women staring at her. Turned out it was an undergarment. - she goes to a pub and people there all sing songs together, she can't join in so she sings to them an english language song. - her boyfriend (future husband) teaches her some tibetan - how to say the equivalent of fair dinkum (I'm not kidding) - she spends an amount of time there pregnant and has to have check ups at the hospital in the city which is in her eyes less moderm and not so well equipped as she's used to. Maybe they go back to aus to give birth? Not sure. - when they come back to aus, her boyfriend or husband stands on the toilet seat and squats cuz that's all he knows.

There was a book that had just been recently released that looked fascinating to me. It was a true crime or historical account about a murder mystery around the late 1800s, early 1900s (""""Sherlock Holmes"""" era), and was one of the the first (or maybe the first) mystery solved with forensic science. I believe there was some suggestion that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had stolen some ideas for Sherlock Holmes's detecting style from the mystery. For some reason I foolishly thought I would remember the title of the book, and I didn't want to buy it in London and have to lug it home (silly me--I ended up buying Twilight and lugging that home--and regretted that decision on several accounts). I've poked around in several places to see if I could find it, but nothing seems familiar."

I recall it having a more philosophical bent than most commercial self-help books, but self-help might be the genre. It was written sometime between 1940 and 1980. I am almost certain the author was American, and he draws heavily from his own lifetime and experiences ?as a businessman? or ?blue-collar worker?. Another remarkable thing about this book compared to others of the kind is that the authorâs biography, on its face, was not remarkable at all save publishing his book of personal wisdom, which received some amount of success upon being released.

I think the cover might have been green. A woman is trying to find evidence of the existence of a ghost in New Orleans. As the story begins, she meets an unsavory man who tells her he can give her information if she meets him in a woods at night. In spite of the apparent danger, she agrees to meet him. She later encounters a woman in New Orleans who's wearing a strange piece of jewelry. The woman (if I remember correctly) tells her she's playing with fire. The ghost does certain things to the woman, such as writing messages in the dust on the TV in the woman's hotel room and arranging the coins on her dresser into piles. In spite of these incidents, the woman still doesn't think she has adequate evidence of the ghost. She's (apparently) hard to convince and wants to actually see a life size manifestation of the ghost. Thanks for your help.

goodreads	18710880	1	Rachel	2017-08-05T00:00:00Z	A paperback book I read in the 1990s, but think it was slightly older, maybe published in the 70s or 80s. It was a memoir by a woman who responded to an advert by a man who wanted someone to live with him on a desert island. He was into survival, going back to nature, that kind of thing and wanted a companion to live with him for a year. I think his name started with a G, maybe Geoff or Garth or something similar. The woman did go to the island with him but basically he turned out to be a total creep and was constantly annoyed that she didn't want a romantic relationship with him. I think she may have left the island early because of his weird behaviour. The other detail nagging at me is that I think it had some kind of relation to a TV show, like maybe a documentary was made about their experiences on the island, but the woman had never told her side of the story before? I also remember it having a black and white cover, but I could be wrong as it's been so long. Any help appreciated.

goodreads	18738808	11	SBC	2018-08-05T00:00:00Z	Could it be a book from the Sweep/Wicca series by Cate Tiernan? It's a YA series with lots of detailed information about Celtic ways and blessings (with a Wiccan twist). It has scenes like you describe with blessing the dagger, using the moonlight, and taking off the clothes for some rites, too. The first book is Book of Shadows but I think the scenes similar to the ones you describe occur in later books.

goodreads	18738808	15	Regina Osiecki	2019-08-05T00:00:00Z	I don't think so. I think the intro of the book was more fiction with a woman doing the rituals and the rest of the book was non fiction about the different types of rituals you can do and how to do them. So I think the lady was providing an example in the beginning and the rest of the book went into detail about the rituals

The very first one is about a sailor who has the figurehead of his ship carved to loook like his bride-to-be. Everyone tells him it's bad luck, but he does it anyway. He goes off to travel, and during a storm, a rope gets wrapped around the figurehead's neck. He comes home and finds out his fiancÃ©e is dead, she accidentally hung herself while trying on her veil.

goodreads	18860342	1	Chrisou	2017-08-05T00:00:00Z	Iâm looking for a book I recently found on amazon: Itâs non-fiction and a collection of stories told by men, mostly about their sexuality (how they discovered it, how theyâre dealing with it etc.), but told in a funny way. Since itâs a collection, it has more than 10 authors. On the cover is a gentleman in a suit, either sitting or leaning. I only remember a few bits of two stories of the book: 1) one author describes the scene of a woman having lunch with two colleagues, with special focus on the perspectives and views of the people involved. One of the colleagues might have been the perfect match for this woman, but was just too shy or intimidated to talk to her, whereas the other one somehow ended up talking to her more, but wasnât really attracted to her. The story ends with the portrayal of the thoughts of the people involved and how things might have ended differently, if some of those thoughts had been conveyed, e.g. the shared love of lake houses by both the shy guy and the woman (or something along those lines). 2) In another story, an author speaks about his early experiences with sexuality in a funny way: He would get erections during (math?) classes, even though neither the subject nor the teacher were particularly arousing. There is of course more to the story, but unfortunately, I didnât get a chance to read any further. The only last piece of information I can give you is that I found the first of those stories through a google search, but since I have cleared my chronic recently, I canât find it anymore. The article was posted on some website, stating that it is part of the aforementioned book, but I canât find it, not for love nor money. Please let me know if you have any ideas about the title of this book! Thanks in advance.

goodreads	18873721	1	Carla C	2017-08-05T00:00:00Z	I read a memoir published in (I think 1943, maybe 42---definitely during the war) about 2 women in Paris who helped the Resistance smuggle downed airmen out of France and back to Britain. The narrator/author was one of the 2 women. She used pseudonyms and different place-names for security reasons, as the war was still ongoing; there was a statement re: this fact on either the title page or foreword. One woman was French, living in Paris; the other was (I think) American. There was a French priest who came to their apartment to help with planning. I cannot remember the title or author; in fact, the author may be been listed as Anonymous. My copy was a red/burgundy hardcover. Does this sound familiar to anyone? Thanks.

I recall an incident where the 2 women drove south from Paris into Vichy France, encountering thousands of people fleeing on foot. And I remember the priest coming to visit in the Paris apartment. I also think the non-Parisian (American, maybe New Yorker, don't think she was British) leaving the country and returning to participate in the smuggling activities. Thanks for your idea, Emily.

goodreads	18912710	1	Chet	2017-08-05T00:00:00Z	The genres for the book I am looking for is non-fiction, occult, magic, witchcraft and possibly angels and demons. I obviously cannot remember the name of the book, but feel it had 'companion' or 'complete' in the title. The book lists the Judeo-christian names of angels and demons and gives a description of how they appear and what they do (such as a particular demon who answers all questions truthfully). It also has listings for historical magicians or supposed practitioners of magic (such as Crowley, Bacon and St. Germaine), zodiac signs, planets and a listing of herbs and their properties. I read this book about five years ago in an Australian library and, after moving back to the area, found that they no longer carry the book. I cannot remember if it was hardback or paperback, though I think it was hard, but the book was very thick. I have been looking for the book for the past three years but have had no luck. I welcome and appreciate any assistance and feedback I can receive. I loaned this book with 'The Complete Dictionary of Symbols : In Myth, Art and Literature' by Jack Tresidder and they were on the same shelf. I have tried seeking this book by searching for keywords related to the book by Mr. Tresidder but have come up with nothing, as this dictionary is considered historical satire and fiction on some sites and non-fiction and philosophical commentary on others.

Then he travels in a boat to africa or some other far away country, I think she comes with him on this trip but she might join him later on with his other trips too. The whole book is written about their life together and all their travels. I want to say its called my wonder life or my wonderful marriage or something like that maybe, or maybe it's just that it has three words in the title im not sure. Its a thick books probably between 300-700 pages. I think the book was released in the 60's but again I really can't remember that for sure. Thanks for any help you can give me!

goodreads	19114840	1	Rebecca	2018-08-05T00:00:00Z	I read this in the 1980s. It was an older hardcover with no dust jacket. Itâs about a city woman with some kind of illness or disability who ends up going to a rural, wooded area of maybe Minnesota or Wisconsin. She has never spent any real time outdoors, and especially not in the woods. She hires a local man as a guide to take her into the woods. I thinks she begins by walking some distance each day with him, and he often has to help her. Eventually she decides to stay overnight once. Ultimately, she ends up camping alone for weeks or longer, and her illness or disability goes away. Itâs a kind of âjourney of discoveryâ book in which she learns about herself. The title might mention a lake or a river. I believe the book dates to about the 1940s or 1950s. This is SOLVED. It turned out to be nonfiction, âThe Healing Woodsâ by Martha Reben.

As a guess, Iâd say she was maybe 35 or 40? I do remember that she didnât think sheâd be able to handle even walking in the woods, but I donât recall why that was.

They thought of the flowers and other aspects of it that they felt at home. The first exercise the reader was then prompted to do is to create a list of your own words that remind you of Home.

(1860-1910'ish) I read it online back between 2006-2009, and it might have possibly been posted to the Hathi Trust Digital Library, or Project Gutenberg, or SoilandHealth, or Google Books, or Archive.org, or somewhere like that. But when I hunt around in those archives, I'm not able to find what I'm looking for. It's a nonfiction, autobiographical this-is-how-we-did-it sort of narrative. The book starts off with a pair of sisters (?) from the city who are shopping for their future homestead. Their agent brings them past a number of old, falling-down farmsteads, but have difficulty finding anything in their price range that's close enough to the train station for convenience and isn't a decrepit wreck. Eventually, they find a place that's shabby, but has promise, and they're able to buy it and get it fixed up. Stuff happens in the middle, I think. Probably involves things like chickens and gardens and things. The next part that I remember is their adventures in trying to make butter. (I think it was towards the middle-end.) They have no clue how to make butter. Some days, the butter forms quickly, in minutes; other days, they can churn the butter for an hour and not have any progress. They realize there's a correspondence between temperature and butter-formation, and armed with this new knowledge, butter-making/dairying proves to be a successful business enterprise for them. Does anyone else read these sorts of books? I was hoping someone would go, """"Oh, yeah! The one about the sisters. That's ------."""" :) TIA!"

goodreads	19229553	1	Louie	2018-08-05T00:00:00Z	Hi, I read the book in the time frame of 2011 to 2013, though I believe it came out in the 20th century. From what I remember it had a bluish, purple cover. I think that there was a drawing of a young girl on the cover, but I'm not certain. It was a hardcover. It was about a young girl who was staying with her grandparents over the summer in a house that had been in their family for generations, when they were told by the government that they had to move by the end of summer, so a company could knock down all the houses in the neighbourhood and build a waterpark. I believe, if I remember correctly, that the Grandfather sent letters to the president about the situation, but I don't think that he received a response back. (view spoiler) [ In the end of the book they moved and the MC went into the new house and placed a flower in the room that she wanted. (hide spoiler)]

The protagonist recruits a former protege, a Greek special forces operative possibly named Theo, to help him with the rescue. They succeed in penetrating the compound and make their way to their exfiltration (a Sea Plane) which takes off with Theo and the target then explodes shortly thereafter. The government suspecting the main character killed the target sends an assassin to kill him in London (Hyde Park) however she fails and he survives. The book ends with a reveal about the billionaire(really the ex-officer) having orchestrated all of this and having blown up a body double st the start of the book. Please help!

goodreads	19260643	1	Victoria	2018-08-05T00:00:00Z	I read this when I was in elementary school (sometime in the 90s). It is either from the 80s or 90s, I think. There are so many parts of the book that vividly stuck with me over the years, but I cannot for the life of me remember the name. The book starts with a boy and his parents. They're living in a future world with more advanced technology and the mother of the boy is slightly overprotective, making him wear a raincoat that has an internal thermostat. She turns the coat's temperature a little too high. There is something wrong with the earth. And many are planning to leave earth to a colony in space. (An impending apocalypse? Depletion of natural resources?) In this world, apparently not many people are able to have children, so the children spend occasional weekends staying with other adults in the community. (I guess to help them have the experience of having a child?) The boy (main character) is set to go and stay with a wealthy elderly woman. He was specially requested by her for being smart or good at math (or something like that?). When he arrives, there are many, many children in her care. It operates a bit like a boarding school? They're put through martial arts classes and other things. At night, their food is drugged so that they will sleep, and their beds lower into a hidden chamber where they are placed in pods that prevent them from aging. Of course, the main character is fighting against what's happening and wants to get back to his family, but he can't leave. He is awoken from his pod too early by the elderly lady's evil assistant(?) with a plan to kill him, I think, and the boy finds himself on a very different, post-apocalyptic earth many, many generations later. To sum it up, there's an upcoming apocalypse. The woman is collecting smart/strong children and puts them into pod things to protect from the apocalypse and sets the pods to release them when the earth has recovered so they can rebuild humanity. But she's kind of evil, and a man who works for her is definitely evil? And he lets the main character out too early, before the earth has recovered. Heeelp, this book has PLAGUED me for so long! I need to know what it is.				
goodreads	19260643	2	Jason Madden	2020-08-05T00:00:00Z	"I've also been looking for this book. I too read it in the early to mid 90s. My memory pretty much matches the OP, but I think I can add some details that might help pinpoint it. (I spent a morning bouncing around search engines looking for anything related and found nothing. It was hard to even find this post!) - I remember the boy as being a bit older, perhaps early teenager. In fact, he might have been older than all the other children the woman had collected. He was going to be trained to be their prince after the apocalypse. - I remember the woman's dwelling as being remote and like a castle. - I think there was also a girl, going to be trained to be the princess. The boy and girl weren't friends at first, but eventually became so? - The child sharing was mandatory, enforced by the government, I think. At the end of each period away from home, each child had the option to be adopted by the people they'd been living with. The woman forged the papers claiming that all the children wanted to be adopted by her, that's how she collected them. The protagonist's parents couldn't believe he would choose adoption; an early scene in the book spells out that he would never do that. - I don't remember the woman as elderly, at least not at first. She was wealthy, and may have had a title (""""Lady"""") that she purchased. I think she wanted to be called """"Mother,"""" which the protagonist didn't like. However, at the end of the book, the boy and girl encounter her after being awakened. She'd been awakened from sleep long before anyone else had, so she's much older than she had been."

The main character is a woman who gets married to a man during an arranged marriage. He soon starts physically abusing her and she finds out he actually likes men. I remember her brother took her out driving which was illegal for women to do. I also remember that she eventually ran away and changed her appearance to escape him. The cover was a picture of the main character I think. Does anyone remember this book?				TW: abuse
goodreads	19300946	2	Annamariah	2018-08-05T00:00:00Z	I think I have read a (Reader's Digest condensed?) book that fits your description. There was an arranged marriage, the man soon turned abusive and was secretly homosexual. The woman was nervous on her wedding night, so her new husband gave her some champagne to help her relax. There was something about how in her inexperience she didn't notice that her husband did not really enjoy their lovemaking. If I remember correctly, the woman eventually escaped her husband, possibly with their child, helped by a foreign man who I think was a doctor. Do you think it's the same book? If so, I'll try to find the one I read, though I can't remember the title at the moment.

Takes place in England around the mid 1800's, I believe. A little girl has been found murdered. Her body is found in the outhouse. Her father is a prominent man in the area. It is a great read and I would love to find it again. I'm sorry I have no other information to give.

goodreads	19315380	1	Maite Penna	2018-08-05T00:00:00Z	In 1961 I was given a book that was purportedly the diary of a girl in turn of the century America writing her observations about family, neighbor, church, school. I think that somewhere in the stories or in the title she said âPraise the Lordâ or something to that effect. There were stories about babysitting her younger siblings, about courtship rituals she observed, about behavior in church, etc.

A fairy from his original world finds him and tells him he needs to come back and save that universe, but he says heâs going to stay here and not leave his friends.

I'm looking for a book of sewing patterns that my mother had when I was a little girl - published possibly before or around the mid-1980s, and certainly no later than about 1992 (when I first started learning how to sew). The book contained a series of patterns of fairy-tale/nursery rhyme characters that were designed to be made out of felt. I can't remember what many of them were, but Goldilocks and the Three bears sticks out in my mind. Little Red Riding Hood might also have been in there, but I'm not sure about that. The main defining feature of the book is that each story had a set of characters and a 'bag' that was a house with windows and doors on the side. Any ideas?

As do those of all publishers. But check them anyway. I used to have several of Dover's books that had to do with costuming and sewing various dolls and teddy's.

goodreads	19350106	1	Aspheric	2018-08-05T00:00:00Z	Hi there, I'm looking for a book series I read as kid around the year 2001 in the UK. The first book starts off with a brother and sister helping their dad move boxes in the basement/garage when suddenly the brick wall bursts open into a void which the brother and sister get pulled into(possibly with a large claw?). My memory here is pretty vague but on the other side, there's a pocket universe where it's winter, and the brother and sister are brought to a castle to be apprenticed to a witch or queen to learn magic, though it's not the queen but her manservant that teaches them. The brother has no talent with magic, though the sister learns quickly. There's a scene where the sister is learning magic with the manservant and she asks him how she's able to materialise things out of nothing, and he replies that this entire pocket universe has been suffused with magic to the point that that's possible, though wouldn't be usually. In the end of the book the sister and brother defeat the witch-queen and escape back to the real world, where they find their father still sitting there on his knees weeping in shock and grief, as barely any time has past in the outside world. The sequel to this book which has to do with the effects of what happens after the siblings arrive back. Apparently their return has caused a general return of magic to the world, and all people under the age of 25 or so have developed magic, with the sister being the most powerful of anyone. The magic is mostly kind of a nuanced control of the physical environment immediately around you and your body. The brother still can't use magic, though he has some kind of anti-magic ability. Then intergalactic magic polar bears (I think?) who worship spiders arrive or something, and the sister and brother go to their world alone because only she's strong enough to withstand travelling through the vacuum of space. I can't say I'm too confident on the details after that point, because it's been nearly probably around 17 years since I read it. If anyone knows of anything that sort of matches up with the books that I'm talking about I'd be really appreciative :) Edit: Sue got it. It's The Doomspell.	unusable			series

I also think that the author talked about the hero's journey in one of the chapters. In the introduction of the book, i specifically remember that the author gave an example of how any book character that preys upon the weak and helpless and lures their victims with charm and beauty could be seen as a vampire archetype.

She said it was a popular book when she read it, which was sometime within the last 10 years. She remembers it being by one author, but contained separate, unrelated short stories, all written in letter format. The stories were HILARIOUS (she kept emphasizing this point) and she thinks the cover was yellow or green. She also only remembers one of the stories/letters, and it was about a man checking into a hotel, only to find out all of the furniture was miniature. I've exhausted all of my resources and can't come up with anything! She used to read this book to her husband who was sick at the time, and is really wanting to find a copy again.

She wrote her story of having survived the Nazi holocaust through several lucky events. e.g., she escaped being shot and falling into a pit. Her father was a doctor, her mother, by sheer chance took a bullet in the head and saved the teen. She worked in a farm in the Ukraine and helped the farmer whose seizure was familiar because her father was an MD. The girl was about 15 when her mother accidentally was shot in the head in town. Girl ran away; She rescues some Jewish Russian soldiers who were in a RR car; they helped her as well. It was nip-and-tuck staying ahead of the Nazis who, I'm guessing, were in trouble with the Russian army. When the war was over she went home to find it occupied. Eventually, she moved to the States. This wasn't a diary; it was a well-remembered re-telling of this girl's capture (and several neighboring families). And her harrowing events until she reached the States. The time frame is - 1943 to '45.

(the rest from here is pretty much spoilers) after the family is released (or they might have escaped) from the camps, they travel to another country. I dont remember which one but I think it was Kazakhstan. I remember them traveling through the russian cities of Tomsk, Omsk, and Novosibirsk. I dont really remember much from there, but I know the family ended up in Mexico somehow before they were able to arrive in America. I hope this helps!

The fictional story begins in Texas in the late 1800's or early 1900's. It told of folks living there not having inside plumbing and most everyone rode horses for transportation. A woman is the center of the story where when we meet her, she's a girl stranded in a tree with her little sister during a storm where water is rising.

goodreads	19455038	1	Sarah	2018-08-05T00:00:00Z	This is a very long shot, as I think this book might have been self-published with a limited print run. The only reason I came across it is because I once worked at a hospital mentioned in the book, and the consultant who took care of the author had a free copy that the author had given her that was lying around on the ward. So, odds are against anyone knowing it... still, I figure it can't hurt to ask. I read this book in 1998, and it was in paperback. I recall the title as being something like 'Out of the Shadows' or 'Out of the Darkness', but unfortunately that's too vague a phrase for me to get anywhere searching it. The author wrote anonymously. As I recall, she gave her surname as 'A', and then, throughout the book, when a character was introduced that she wanted to anonymise (usually a doctor) she would give their surname as the next letter in the alphabet, so we'd get Dr B, Dr C, etc. I have a feeling her first name began with a J - Jean? Joan? Something like that. The book was autobiographical and told the story of her years as an alcoholic and her struggle to give up drinking. Events that I can remember from her life include: She had anorexia for a while in her teens; I think she was at a boarding school at the time but I'm not sure about that. As I recall, it didn't get recognised or treated but she eventually outgrew it. She went to university - economics, I think - and got a job working in a pub in the evenings to save money, which is where the problem with the alcoholism started. She got married and had children called Chloe and David, followed by a miscarriage. Chloe and the miscarriage were both unplanned pregnancies and there was a whole thing about her being worried in case either the drinking or some sleeping pills her doctor had given her had impacted on Chloe when she was pregnant (Chloe was fine when born). She worked various jobs. I think one was in a bookshop run by a member of her or her husband's family who gave her the job due to her being a family member. At another point, she got a job teaching maths to sixth form students, but found she didn't remember nearly enough of her A-level maths so completely crashed and burned; there was then a complaint from a parent about her smelling of alcohol while teaching, which mystified her as she avoided drinking before work (she realised with hindsight that she was drinking so much in the evenings that she still smelled of alcohol the next day). When she eventually tried to stop drinking, it was hugely difficult and she was under various doctors. At one point she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital (the one where I later worked where there was this copy of the book). Her daughter, now a teenager, was going off the rails somewhat at this point due to the stress. She tried Antabuse or something similar - I forget exactly which one - but it had no effect on her. Any bells rung?

There just isn't enough information online for me to check for sure, but all the details match, so I'm pretty sure this is the one.

It definitely started in Sydney - a vicar/priest and his Irish catholic mum. I think his father had been a pharmacist in the Sydney CBD or his mum worked in a pharmacy. Brown suitcase features, could have been on the cover. Could have been a reference to being a Â£10 pom and coming over with just a suitcase. I think the priest son and widowed mother went to Europe together on a kind of pilgrimage. I recall it being gentle and sweet and hilarious and I clearly lent it someone and never got it back.

At one point he describes a camp scene with some other westerners where they posed the question, """"If you could be any animal, what would you be?"""" And one guy (probably the knowledgeable guide) says he would be a bird, and explains why. As I recall it, the author was quite taken with the guide's answer. I've tried finding the passage in books by Laurens Van der Post, with no luck. But the book has that same sort of style, if it's not Van der Post.

As he comes to know the children, and sees how they live, Chi Huang is drawn deeper and deeper into their complex and desperate lives. The doctor soon realizes that to truly help these children, he will have to follow the example of Jesus: live among them, love them in spite of their brokenness, and cling to his faith in God's goodness, even when it appears it is nowhere to be found.

goodreads	19524838	1	Marie-Louise Karttunen	2018-08-05T00:00:00Z	This is an amusing tale of a year or so that a British woman spent in Finland teaching English to adults in either the 60s or late 50s. In it she describes interactions with the locals, learning to cross-country ski and coming last in a local competition, some sedate dating in the company of another English friend who was wearing an incongruous fringed yellow silk shawl. I think the title is something like 'On top of the world' and the cover (I think) was a semi-cartoonish depiction of a woman tangled in her skis in front of a snowy hill. Maybe moose horns figured.

goodreads	19532227	1	Jenna	2018-08-05T00:00:00Z	SOLVED- the book is Patchwork Clan This was given to me by a neighbor to read as a child, so it was an adult book but very readable and possibly mildly Christian/inspirational in bent or maybe from a Christian publisher knowing this neighbor. It was a thick paperback and the cover had a photo of the family and all the kids all standing maybe on the steps to their home decked out in full 70s/80s regalia. I donât recall that the book described any great hardship - I think it was pretty sanitized in that everything went great and there were enough resources and room for everyone to go around, the kids all got along and adjusted ok, everyone was on board with the whole project, happy endings for the most part, etc. I remember specifically that the family had kids of pretty much every age or developmental stage, some with special needs, and became kind of the go-to family in their area when there was a kid in need of adoption or fostering. I think it was a suburban or rural setting rather than urban? I remember it left me with the impression as a kid that I could grow up and adopt a family of 30 and everything would be ok fine no problem, which I thought sounded fantastic! It was not The Family Nobody Wanted or The Children Nobody Wanted, which were originally written in the 40s I think - this was definitely set between the 60s and 80s.

goodreads	19536510	1	Elizabeth	2019-08-05T00:00:00Z	GENRE & FORMAT: It was an audiobook. I didnât read it, but I happened to be in the room for a few minutes to hear the pumpkin scene. I donât know whether this is a collection of short stories, or a full-length novel, or what. YEAR: Not sure. I think it was sometime from 2000 to 2010, ish, but I donât know. Iâll post a comment if I can narrow this further. PLOT DETAILS: The mother is alone with the baby in the kitchen, and sheâs trying to make pumpkin pie. I think itâs for Thanksgiving, or maybe just a family event. Anyway, the baby needs changing, so the mother tends to that, but she realizes too late that the babyâs buttocks is very close to the food. The husband comes home a little later and sees his wife in the kitchen with the pumpkin stuff. She takes a spoonful, sniffs it, and says to herself, âThatâs pumpkin.â She drops the spoonful into a bowl. She takes another, sniffs, and says, âThatâs not,â and drops it in the garbage. I donât think she ever explains this to him, but I think they wind up with some other kind of dessert instead.				audiobook

I know it was somehow related to marketing and it was divided into stories. From what I recall, there were two stories there. I think the whole book was about someone (I have this idea that the person was maybe a journalist? not 100% sure). One of the stories was about him being part of a gang that sold drugs and he was like documenting the whole thing. The other story, which is the one I really loved was because the main idea was that """"information is key"""" when it comes to a lot of things in life. The story was about him infiltrating the KKK and once he knew the passcode for their reunions, he shared it with someone he knew at a local radio station, when radio stations used to have those """"soap operas"""", you know what I mean? So on that show they would use the KKK passcode, making that passcode useless for the KKK, because the kids who used to listen to the show were now using the passcode when playing with their friends. I'm not 100% sure, but I have this idea that the cover of the book was orange or something really close to it. Hope it helps :) Thanks! Tiago"

goodreads	19602764	1	Dani	2019-08-05T00:00:00Z	Found this book in Barnes and Nobel. It was by two authors who showed you how to make and publish a graphic novel. The whole book's layout was a comic with the authors showing up or commenting on the pages as you read. The book was in full color with most of the tools needed to make a graphic novel actually drawn out and not referenced with a photograph. I believe the book also covered how to make web comics as well. That's about all I remember.

It talks about what tools you'll need to make the comic (and the tool representations are all hand drawn), the authors have drawn themselves into the comic and pop up along the side panels and in the corners of the panels too. One panel that I do still remember was the authors mentioning how you can put your comic online and used the web comic Penny Arcade as an example. There was also a section on how to get published, how to find an agent, how to self-publish, and how to market your work. But the part that stood out most about the book was that it was all illustrated - the authors, the tools, using Photoshop on your computer - all hand drawn illustrations. And I thought it was so awesome that someone put that much work into making this book to the point of illustrating pen numbs and the different types you could use for your work. Basically the attention to detail was amazing. Sorry for the long response. Hope this helps!"

goodreads	19618674	1	Chloe	2019-08-05T00:00:00Z	I read this book at some point in the last five or seven years. I picked it up off one of the front tables in an (American) bookstore so I believe it had just been released shortly before I read it. I think the cover was a headshot of a woman facing the camera, possibly with her making a silly expression or something. The book was in this memoir sort of format about the various experiences this woman had had with famous people, mostly actors (Iâm not completely sure but most likely they were all American actors). I donât think she was a reporter of any kind, she just happened to have a lot of experiences with famous actors, but I could be wrong. There were about 10 chapters and their titles all followed the format of â[Famous person] does/is [something]â, and most of the titles looked like they were revealing some kind of secret or characteristic about the famous person. One example I can remember is a chapter titled â[Famous male actor] thinks Iâm crazyâ and the chapter told an anecdote where the author went to a movie premiere or something where that actor was signing things and the author got so excited about meeting him that they acted really strangely or creepily, possibly even threw up on him? I believe (but am not completely certain) that there was also a chapter in it where the author really wanted to ask a certain actress about a certain topic or question. Finally she got the chance to interview the actress and when the author got there, she noted that the actress was dressed very casually and kept ending her sentences with âmmkayâ. Finally near the end of the interview the author got to ask her the question she had wanted to know. Any help finding this book is appreciated, thank you in advance!

goodreads	19618674	5	Chloe	2019-08-05T00:00:00Z	I talked with my sister and she remembered the same book! She couldnât remember the title or author either, but talking to her made me remember more details. Now Iâm pretty sure the author was a journalist- the actress she wanted to ask a specific question was Jennifer Lopez. The author was working for Good Housekeeping (or some other American magazine similar to that, with a really âvanillaâ and housewife kind of reputation to it). She proposed that they interview Lopez for the magazine, but the magazine execs didnât want to do it because they thought Lopez had too much of a wild/controversial reputation and didnât fit the tone of their magazine. The author then started throwing out hypothetical headlines and said Lopez could fit on the cover of the magazine if the headline was something like âI *am* a good girlâ, so the execs told her she could interview her if she tried to get a quote like that from her that they could use as the headline. So the author interviewed Lopez and tried to steer the conversation in a direction where Lopez would say a quote like that, and finally near the end Lopez said that phrase basically word for word, so they were able to put Lopez on the cover with the quote as the headline. Sorry that this is kind of an infodump haha. Iâll try to remember more details about it

They ask the earthlings questions about their leaders and about how they define beauty. Then they head back to Earth. Background: A client asked me to find this sci fi short story (maybe an excerpt) that he read maybe 15 years ago in the NY Times or Playboy. He said it may have been written by Arthur C. Clarke, but I have skimmed all his popular pieces on the Internet. It could be in one of his compilation books. I have also searched the NY Times online. Or it could be from an unknown author written for the Playboy sci-fi story competition. Playboy has a compilation book of sci-fi stories, but I don't have access to it.	unusable			short story

The excerpt was a very detailed description of cutting up an onion, how when you slice it open, it expands like it's been under pressure, and the halves do not fit together. I looked up the book it was from at the time -- it was a long sort of novella written perhaps by a monk in which he describes how to prepare an ox or lamb or something over the course of several days. It's basically a 200 page prose recipe with spiritual overtones. I think the title may be something like """"How to cook a lamb in three days"""" or something."

I don't think the book was focused on romance, but it may have had a focus on how this other person changed the main character. They have little to no interaction after the breakdown. (Maybe the main character sees them and decides not to approach? Or it's a very """"oh, nice to see you again"""" sort of quick conversation? I just can't remember.) I think it's coming-of-age.

When I was living in St. Louis I snipped a Dave Barry article out of the Post-Dispatch and sent it to my father (OK, it was a long time ago). He loved it, completely identified with it, and became a life-long Dave Barry fan. It was about trying on pants. Specifically, trying on every pair of pants in his closet and sorting them into those that fit well, were acceptable, too small, etc. Maybe he made it seem like sort of an exercise or aerobic activity? Anyway, my dad used to do that, periodically: take out thirty pairs of identical (except for size) khakis out of the closet, try on each one, pull out the ones that fit, and relegate the rest of them to the basement until my dad's next diet (or expansion) so my dad really identified with the column I haven't seen that column collected in any of his books (which doesn't mean it wasn't; I haven't read them all). The column is not """"Shop 'til You Drop (in Size)"""" (05.25.97) or """"Hung by Your Threads"""" (06.14.87) or """"Too Big for Your Britches"""" (10.13.85).

I think the men start showing affection, and she feels the need to leave the restaurant because of it. I don't believe it was purely for homophobic reasons, but because the woman's son or brother had AIDS, and she was reminded of it by those men.

goodreads	19746906	1	Justine	2019-06-27T00:00:00Z	I am looking for a historical romance I had read about 4 years ago. Set in regency England. The hero is a lord, Earl I think who advertises for a wife through his solicitors. He thinks he dying from a hereditary disease, involving terrible headaches. The heroine has fallen on hard times and stays with her mother and younger brother. The younger brother is sick and she needs money for his treatment. The heroine's father was abusive. I think the heroine's name is Catherine or Caroline or something else with C. She does not tell the H about her brother. They get married and later the hero comes to know about it I guess. Now the main plot.. and the spoiler. They come to know that the hero is not dying but has been given a medicine over the years to make him sick. His father too had been given the same. They find this when the heroine has some of the sweet which hero likes and is specially prepared for him. Turns out it's somebody very close to the hero who's the culprit. If somebody finds the book please let me know. It is not Loving the Marquess Thanks in advance!

They described the book as being about a hero who takes a bride of convenience because he thinks he's dying (he has severe migraine headaches). It turns out he's secretly being poisoned by someone who wants his title. They discover the poisoning plot when the heroine, who is pregnant, eats a pastry with the poison and becomes ill. If this is the same book, the person was searching for the book back in 2013 and said they read the book around 10 years earlier so it was definitely published before 2013 and likely was published before the mid-2000s.

The blurb on the back of the book doesn't include any relevant plot points so it was impossible to find by searching for it. The only thing I'm not sure about is the headaches. The hero, an earl, thinks he's dying from a heart condition so he enters into a marriage of convenience with the heroine in order to produce an heir. It turns out the hero is being poisoned by his brother (half brother?), and the plot is discovered when the heroine eats a danish with the poison in it. The heroine's name starts with a C (Caroline), her father was abusive, and she marries the hero because she's in need of money because her brother is ill.

During this excursion he slips while climbing onto a moving train and ends up losing a leg in the accident. Afterwards he gets a prosthetic, his friendships with the group he was with as well as his crush fall apart because they see him as a cripple.

As James struggles to adapt to his new reality, heâs surprised by a great many things. His teammates Kimberly and Joel turn out to be true friends. His visit from the War Amps nets him a new friend, teenaged amputee Tariq, who plays soccer and challenges James to think beyond his disability. He also counsels James to let go of his bitterness and anger toward Neil. He canâtâand when he learns that Neil is going to receive an award for bravery, heâs furious. It was Neil who drove James onto the tracks that day. So what if Neil also pulled him to safety? It takes a return to the ice and some help from a secret friend to get James back on the right track and into the game.

Small for thirteen but tougher than anyone except maybe his rival Black Jack Levitt, Chauncey finds himself hitting out irrationally (and usually physically) at everyone who comes near. Though he longs to live with his thrice-divorced mother, who tears him up by neither taking him in nor letting him go, he must stay instead with a suspicious grandfather who shoots stray cats and beats, bothers and imprisons Chauncey so that he will grow up straight. It's evident that the old man does care for the boy in his own way but just as obvious that his way makes Chauncey's life with him unendurable; thus it's a relief that even after Chauncey suffers a serious leg injury and runs away on crutches with the one kitten he has saved from the shotgun ...

goodreads	19781333	1	Yoav Gedalia	2019-08-05T00:00:00Z	My wife was reading a book which I brought to the teacher room at my school; then, it disappeared. Plot: Man wants to travel cross country in Eastern Europe with nothing but a horse and trailer. He traveled with his kids; I recall that his wife joined him later. They got sponsors at the beginning of their travels to defray the cost of the journey. The wife didn't like the lack of privacy in the trailer (I don't recall if it was called a wagon/buggy/carriage/trailer). I remember random incidents; they'd stop for a day to do laundry; they were always getting free food from good Samaritans; one time, they got ground meet which was green but which they cooked and enjoyed anyway. I recall little about the plot save that they had to replace the horse's shoes, at one point, I think, they had to replace the horse. I'm just at a loss because my wife was really enjoying the book - I lost it! - and I barely recall anything that clearly demarcates the book. I think they traveled through Eastern Europe - Slovakia, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia - if not all of those countries, then some of them.. It was more a diary than a book. Thanks in advance (and hoping you can help)! Book I'd say was written later than 1980 and earlier than 2010. Author, got no clue!

The father, David Renwick Grant , has written a few books about their travels. The one you are looking for might be Spirit of the Vikings - A Journey in the Kayak Bah' Viking This is a kayaking book with a difference. The inspiration for the journey, from Sweden to the Black Sea, via the Baltic and rivers of eastern Europe, came somewhere in Kazakhstan when David Grant, while travelling with his wife and children in a horse-drawn caravan, was reading a translation of the fictitious Viking saga Rode Orm, or Red Serpent, A life-long interest in things Viking, coupled with a wish to experience a solo expedition on a shoe-string budget, dictated that the authors longship should actually be a kayak. The route would follow approximately that of Rode Orms vessel but continue on to the Black Sea and possibly further. The result was a fascinating journey through the waters of the Swedish Archipelago, across the Baltic to the island of Gotland and on to Riga in Latvia, where the river travel began. Up the Daugava-Dvina and its tributary the Ulla, through the disused and decaying Verebki canal and across the watershed, then down the Berezina and Dneiper, to emerge into the Black Sea. It was published in 2007. If not this one maybe check out his other books? Like The Seven Year Hitch: A Family Odyssey . Not sure if there are many travel books about families travelling in horse-drawn caravans! But who knows...

I don't remember more useful information unfortunately. I read it in 2009 but the book is older i think it was written in the last half of twentieth century."

I remember it being a brisk read and containing some moving and thought-provoking anecdotes about life in the Jim Crow South for a young white teenager who loved jazz, the Jimmie Lunceford band, and played in a swing orchestra himself...there was a particular story in the book in which the author's parents tell him to go deliver a payment to their grocer, """"the Jew Ben Greene"""" to which the boy does, asking """"are you the Jew Ben Greene?"""" The grocer responds """"just Ben Greene, thank you, I won't tie your religion to your name if you don't tie one to mine"""" (best recollection) and I remember how simply and breezily the author contributed this little life lesson without hammering home the details or embellishing. No amount of Google searching variations of the above dialogue has helped me and my library in Joliet, IL no longer carries the book, for I've scoured the shelves trying to find it. I think the state in which the author grew up was Kentucky, but of course I could be wrong on that as well as the grocer's name, etc. Any help would be much appreciated!"

It's a combination of fantasy, chicklit, ya fiction, romance, and adventure. The female protagonist is a princess (or some type of royalty) in her late teens or early twenties and has the ability to manipulate/bend water. Her powers can be dangerous and hard to control at times, which is a plot point that jumpstarts the novel. She accidentally kills someone at the beginning of the novel which leads to her running away and joining a group of pirates. They go on a series of adventures that build up to a massive battle at the end. The pirates don't like her at first but they grow close and she becomes part of the crew. She and the pirate captain - whose name I'm pretty sure is Gideon but I could be wrong - fall in love along the way. It's one of those will they-won't they situations and one where their feelings are obvious to everyone around them. One of the plot points includes them searching for a magical ring or similar object connected to the female protagonist's powers/some ancient force. Ending scene includes a battle with plot twist (included at bottom of post) Other random details: - The author started a sequel that I remember having a reddish orange cover and was more fire based/had fire as a plot point (as opposed to the blueish cover/water based plot of the first book), but then discontinued writing it because of writer's block or a similar issue. She never said anything that I can remember about taking the books down, so the first one at least should still be up. - the female protagonist's mother is dead and her father remarried. I'm pretty sure the stepmother ends up being the big bad but I could be wrong. - Gideon/the pirate captain has a tragic past that includes a dead fiancÃ©e (I think she died in a fire? which might have influenced the second book) - there's a scene in the book where the female protagonist and Gideon are alone, somewhere on an island or a beach. She touches an ancient sword/magical object (it might have been the one they were looking for) and blacks out/has a vision. She wakes up to Gideon holding her to his chest, thinking she's dead - I vaguely remember the main character cutting off her hair/having to disguise herself as a man to hide in an army - at the end of the novel, the female main character and Gideon end up fighting the big bad. AND ***SPOILERS*** IN A MAJOR PLOT TWIST (at least to me, I totally didn't see this coming) Gideon betrays the female protagonist, in a move related to his past trauma. The main character was trying to persuade him to either kill or not kill the villain, or something like that. He does the opposite of what she whats him to do, despite loving her and having gone through so much. It was a really upsetting moment for the characters and the second novel picks up immediately afterwards.

The only example he remembers is the idea that the width of a space shuttle is based upon the width of a railroad, which is ultimately based upon the width of a horse.

The ones I can remember were about the earth, but I don't remember if they were all about the earth. Each scenario would have a full page drawn picture, and the other page would describe the scenario. The scenarios I remember are: 1) If there were a tube that went through the earth, what would happen if you fell into it? The answer was you would stop when you reached the center of the earth. 2) If the tube through the earth had no air resistance, what would happen if you fell into it? The answer was you would speed up until you reached the center, then slow down until you reached the other side of the earth. At that point, unless you grabbed on to something, you would fall back through to the first side. 3) If the earth was shrunk down to the size of a beach ball, would you be able to feel the mountains and ocean floors? The answer was that those are so small in comparison to the size of the earth, that the shrunken earth would be smoother than a beach ball."

He was the boss of his division and his two seconds in command had an unfulfilled flirtation that may have escalated on the island. There was a house and they were stranded there due to a storm. There was an older wealthy home owner that may have been ill or hurt and a staff that all had to be questioned due to the crime that occurred while they were on the island-not the reason they first went there though.	unsolved

One of the requirements is that you must be married to the other person so these two people marry to be able to go to the island.

goodreads	20118476	1	Florence	2019-08-05T00:00:00Z	Hi looking for a craft book I had as a child (in the 90s). It was thin and landscape rather than portrait with a pale blue or green cover, maybe with some kind of mouse or doll on it? There were recipes/instructions for caraway seed toffee, pomanders, I think lavender sachets, maybe corn dollyâs? It might have been a theme of historical crafts? Possibly bought from a museum bookshop!				
goodreads	20118476	2	Kris	2019-08-05T00:00:00Z	Florence, was this craft/recipe book specifically for children or adults? Did it mention a British or American historical time period? Words like pioneers, settlers, farms, Christmas, etc.?				
goodreads	20118476	3	Florence	2019-08-05T00:00:00Z	Iâd say aimed more at adults than children. It wasnât linked to a specific holiday, it focussed on historical British crafts and recipes, Victorian or older I think, maybe even Tudor.

goodreads	20161750	1	slauderdale	2020-06-27T00:00:00Z	This book was a paperback, probably late 80s to mid-90s (I was reading it in the early to mid-nineties.) I suppose it was a romance book. The main characters are indigenous peoples hundreds or thousands of years ago in South or Central America, or possibly Florida - at any rate, somewhere green and steamy in the Americas. The book begins with archaeologists on a dig in the present; they open something (perhaps a pottery vessel of some kind?) that looses a kind of whirlwind or howling, which dissipates. They wonder what it was after the fact, but I don't think they ever get to find out. They are just there as a narrative device to kick off the story proper. Hundreds/thousands of years ago, the chief of a particular tribe is a tyrant who goes around taking his pick of the women from other tribes that he has subdued. He goes to this one tribe, where the young female lead lives. Because she is beautiful and likely to be chosen, another older woman hands her a baby and tells her to pretend that she is a new mother so that she will be spared. However, the cruel young chieftain sees that she is unable to breastfeed the crying child while the other woman is clearly lactating, and he tells her to give the child back to its mother. He then takes the young woman with him, even though she already has a man that she is supposed to wed. Despite the aforementioned crappiness of this despotic chieftain, she comes to fall in love with him, and he becomes less rotten as he falls in love with her in turn. But...the young man that she was supposed to marry is an up-and-coming shaman, a basically nice guy who becomes consumed with anger and hatred for the one who took his promised wife from him. I don't know what the young shaman does exactly - a spell, an invocation of some kind? - for revenge, but whatever it is doesn't work and his angry spirit becomes trapped. We realize that the whirlwind or howling at beginning of the book was the emergence of the shaman's angry spirit, which had been trapped for all these centuries. I don't think the spirit is implied to go on to do anything, though. I think it just dissipates.

goodreads	20161750	9	Rainbowheart	2021-06-27T00:00:00Z	Did you also rule out Daughter of the Red Deer ? This sounds like genre romance, and those typically do have female authors. Somewhere in the Americas, I guess it could be either North, Central, or South. But if it's a steamy, jungle-like setting, maybe a rainforest. Was the book told from the POV of the female MC, or did the male characters also have chapters from their perspectives? Jean M. Auel keeps coming to mind, but I don't think any of hers were set in the Americas.

goodreads	20192218	1	Bob	2019-08-05T00:00:00Z	I'm looking for a book that is set the 80's or 90s in England. The book is about a boy that is abused primarily by his mother (who you learn has severe mental illness) and partially by his timid father that suffers from epilepsy. He has two other brothers I believe that don't get it as bad as him. He grows up poor and is subjected to terrible things. He eventually gets taken into care. The family mentors him a little but he has to leave when he's older. He then finds it difficult to hold down a job, he's screwed over by his legitimate employment so he turns to a life of low level crime. He's used as muscle. He's used to do backyard fighting for money. He's eventually set up to take a fall in a fight. This takes place within a ring of cars. He later finds love in his girlfriend but his abuse makes his mannerisms unusual and he has to explain all this to her. It is a true story about him growing up I believe. If you know the title of this book and can link me it, I would be extremely grateful. It is similar to a boy called it.

I downloaded it, and it's the exact book written by Adrian Vincent first published in 1974, I would of read it in the late 80s. he was the young man, and it's his experiences of being a POW and of Stalag V11B, and then as the war finished the subsequent march to freedom. Thanks again to Kris, Ayshe and Goodreads for your assistance with this , I have been wanting to read this book for over 30 years. I have now ordered a hardcopy version Cheers Donovan	confirmed			
goodreads	20532969	1	Donovan	2020-08-05T00:00:00Z	"Good evening I have been searching for a book for many years that I read as a child in the 80s. The book was about a boy/young man who is kept in prisoner camps, I believe in Poland during WW2 and becomes friends with a guard over a few years to try and stay alive. Towards the end it documents him going on very long walks being escorted by the German troops ,nearly dying of the cold and starvation before the Germans ultimately surrender. Most of the book is about POW life in different Stalags. I thought the book was called """"the long way home"""" or """" the long walk home"""" but have not been able to find it. Any help is appreciated"

goodreads	20532969	11	Donovan	2024-08-05T00:00:00Z	Still looking. It was a book about a teenager who was stuck in one of the gulags in Poland I think.Its about all he does to survive being in the camp Towards the end of the book they are forced to do very long marches until they finally are released to either the US troops (or russians) and their German captors then hand themselves over From memory it was called the long walk home, or the long way home any assistance appreciated				
goodreads	20532969	12	Whipkitty	2024-08-05T00:00:00Z	Have you considered contacting a specialty museum? The Holocaust museum collection might include the book or someone curating the collection might know. I am v. familiar with the literature and because so many WWII camp narratives end with forced marches and some have been retitled once or twice it will be hard to tease out which one you are trying to find.

Booklist: Aging daughter of the South Sookie Simmons Poole has trudged along cheerfully through life under the shadow of her overbearing mother, Lenore. Faced with empty-nest syndrome, Sookie knows she wonât be too bored, since Lenore lives right next door and still has her mail delivered to Sookieâs house. When a mysterious letter arrives, Sookie questions everything she ever knew about her family, and her story soon dovetails with that of a proud Polish family from Wisconsin. The Jurdabralinskisâ gas station was nearly shuttered when all the area men joined up during WWII, but the familyâs four girls bravely stepped up. Eldest daughter Fritzi was already a great mechanic, having been a professional stunt plane pilot in the 1930s. When Fritzi joins the WASPS, an elite but downplayed female branch of the U.S. Air Force, the story really comes to life. Kirkus: (The following is a combined review for THE ALL-GIRL FILLING STATION' and S LAST REUNION) Flagg highlights a little-known group in U.S. history and generations of families in an appealing story about two women who gather their courage, spread their wings and learn, each in her own way, to fly (I Still Dream About You, 2010, etc.). After marrying off all three of her daughters (one of them twice to the same man), Sookie Poole is looking forward to kicking back and spending time with her husband and her beloved birds. She's worked hard throughout life to be a good mother to her four children and a perfect daughter to her octogenarian mother. Lenore Simmons Krackenberry's a legend in Point Clear, Ala., and has always been narcissistic, active in all the """"right"""" organizations, and extremely demanding. She's also become increasingly bonkers, a disorder that seems to run in the Simmons family. Throughout much of her life, Sookie's never felt as if she's measured up to Lenore's exacting standards, and she's terrified she, too, might lose her marbles. Then, Sookie receives an envelope filled with old documents that turn her world and her beliefs about herself and her family topsy-turvy. Her emotional quest for answers leads Sookie down a winding yet humorous path, as she meets with a young psychiatrist at the local Waffle House and tracks down descendants of a Polish immigrant who opened a Phillips 66 filling station in Pulaski, Wis., in 1928. What she discovers about the remarkable Jurdabralinski siblings inspires her: Fritzi, the eldest daughter, developed a unique idea to keep her father's business operating during difficult times, but her true passion involved loftier goals. During World War II, she used her exceptional skills to serve her country in an elite program, and two of her sisters followed suit. Finding inspiration in their professional and personal sacrifices, Sookie discovers her own courage to make certain decisions about her life and to accept and take pride in the person she is."	unusable			deleted

It was a true story, I think set in the North of the US or in Canada. Early pages are about an intense teen friendship between the writer and a girl who had a more troubled life. By the time the writer goes to college they aren't hanging out any more. Some time later, the writer discovers her friend has been murdered. The murdered woman's life hadn't fulfilled any of her early promise, and the writer feels guilt about their very different life stories. The rest of the book is about her trying to find out what her friend's life was like and, ultimately, forcing herself to imagine the night she died, as a way of honouring the friendship she had given up on. That's why I thought """"Into that darkness"""" was the title, as she dares herself to go into the dark and be there for her friend in her last moments."

It was a hardback, coffee-table sized book called (if I remember correctly) """"Science Fiction Movies"""" or """"Science Fiction Films"""". It was printed on gloss stock and had numerous color as well as B&W photos to accompany the text. The content was a comprehensive, critical, chronological review of science fiction and fantasy films up to the publication date of the book, which must have been after 1971 since I recall seeing """"A Clockwork Orange"""" pictures in it. I don't recall anything later than that, so year of first publication may have been 1972 or 1973. The book seemed balanced between US and European film, so I suspect it may have been of British origin.

When crossing an intersecting street, however, Misha used a better and more intelligent method than his human counterparts. Unlike us, he didnât cross at the corner. Instead, he would turn up the intersecting street and go about twenty feet from the corner, cross there, and return on the sidewalk to Brattle Streetâs sidewalk, where he would continue his journey. At first I couldnât understand this maneuver, although Misha invariably used it. Then I saw its merits, and copied him thereafter. Why is Mishaâs method safer? Because at any point along the block, traffic comes from only two directions instead of from four directions, as it does at the intersection. By crossing at midblock, one reduces oneâs chances of being hit by a turning car. Since learning the midblock technique from Misha, I have noticed that almost all free-ranging dogs do likewise, as do people who need extra time to cross or who depend on their hearing for safety. Certain blind people, for instance, use the same technique.	solved	The Hidden Life of Dogs	2533379	by Elizabeth Marshall Thomas

It was full of interesting dog behavior, one story I can remember described how dogs do not cross streets at intersections - too dangerous.

Specifically, I remember that it was written by a man of science (maybe a physicist, maybe just a high school science teacher) who hadn't paid much attention to the whole UFO thing until his town underwent a """"flap"""" and so he decided to treat the reports (and the things he and others saw) as a scientific observer - he comes out the other end feeling that if the (few) observations he personally had, and the reports from others, were actually solid observations, the objects seen could not be observing the known laws of physics. If it helps, the cover of this book (hardcover), iirc, had a black background, the stylized/partial body/edge of a saucer (or cylinder) in dark blue, and bright yellow portholes - perhaps the book was dark blue, the outline lighter blue, but I definitely remember the contrast between the bright yellow portholes and the blue. The name MAY (but certainly also MAY NOT) have been something along the lines of OPERATION UFO or something. I remember two specific """"sightings"""" he had - one was very low-level, students telling him that at a popular """"park and neck"""" spot, they'd seen strange lights. So he hangs out there at night and, looking directly overhead, sees a number of points of light that strongly resemble stars but which furtively move around. The second sighting was when he walked out his front door near sunset and saw this large thing in the sky, on the horizon, that I think looked like a """"stubby bullet"""" and which disappeared or entered a cloud."

He decided to buy half an abandoned hamlet and she does not like it. She will later encounter a woman named Jeanne. He also knows that the book must have been from the end of the twentieth century or beginning of twenty first century because the price was converted in francs.

I'm so sure it is called """"Asylum"""", although there may have been a sentence following a colon after it. The book was written by a journalist who went undercover, and admitted himself into a mental institution, and reported his findings there. I cannot remember any specific scenes that occurred within the book. I remember it being written in a very dry, journalistic style. It was maybe something between 300-400 pages. I'm pretty sure the cover was a black-and-white photo of a man holding a cigarette with his hands on his forehead. It was sort of like he was face-palming with a cigarette between his fingers.

Itâs a non-fiction gardening âreferenceâ book, for lack of a better term. Hardback, glossy pages, possibly over 1000 pages long. The first couple chapters were about basic gardening information (soil types, growing zones, light requirements, grafting plants, etc.), but the bulk of the book was devoted to in-depth information about various gardening plants. Each page was devoted to one plant, and gave description of plant and its subspecies, growing zones, soil and water needs, light requirements, growing season, and even if the plant was poisonous to people or animals. Each plant had at least one picture, usually two. However, what was most memorable to me was that the plants were organized first by type (tree, flower, shrub, groundcover, etc.), and then further sorted by light requirements. Iâve tried looking for this book at my college and public libraries, but the closest any of them came was âThe Complete Garden Flower Bookâ published by the Laurel Glen publishing company, and that was definitely not it.

goodreads	21293101	1	Sarah	2020-08-05T00:00:00Z	I recall this (the memories are very vague, so I might have some of this wrong) as a paperback book by a Chinese woman in the USA, about her experience with integrating the two cultures. The latest I could have read it would have been summer of 1999, though I think it was earlier. I think it was an American book; I was definitely visiting the USA when I read it. Here are the two things I remember about it: 1. It included a myth about a young girl who trained with a warrior couple to be a warrior herself and to fight to rescue her people. She found the warrior couple by following some kind of sign; I think it was a miniature bird. She had to sleep on a bed that was exactly her own width, so she learned not to roll over in her sleep. There was mention of her getting her first period and thinking she could control how she bled because she was so practiced in controlling her body during fighting, but being told by the warriors that she couldn't do this. At the end of the story, the author (who I think had been told the story by her grandmother or mother when she was a child) talked about how desperately she'd wanted, as a child, to find a sign like that and undergo the same training. 2. There's a scene where one woman - I think the author's grandmother or mother - was buying a girl as a slave in the market. She asks the girl various questions to determine her intelligence/competence, of which the only one I remember was how to cast on stitches while knitting; the girl shows her by pantomiming it using her fingers instead of needles. Does this ring any bells? I have a feeling it was quite a well-known book in the USA at the time. I checked Amy Tan's and Jung Chang's work but couldn't see anything that seemed to fit.

She has a bad acid trip, kills her neighbor & decides to steal a baby to take to her old cult leader. She calls the baby Drummer. The mom of the baby decides to chase her down, and most of the book is centered on that. The MC is rejected by her old cult leader as he's now just a man living a regular life.

I vaguely remember this book being a love story- as I know there were at least two characters in it- and I believe it switched from them being in college to their present day. The most distinguishing part of this book is that there was âwritingâ on the sides of the pages that was written by the female character- responding or commenting to what the male character was saying in the story and there is a possibility that the âwritingâ was in red. This book was written in English and I believe it was meant for people in their 20s-30s to read. The book itself did not seem that old. I believe the cover was yellow but that is all I can remember. POSSIBLE SPOILER - - - - - - - - - I have a vague recollection that towards to the end or possibly the end of the book the female character writes something on the side of the page that causes the male character to stop narrating the story.â But idk if I am remembering wrong.

I always mention it to people and they think I am referring to a much more popular FICTION book (and later film) about a serial killer and perfume. No, this is way cooler! It is a REAL MAN who lived and it details the story of the perfume industry and his involvement in it. He had a remarkable gift (and collected) where he could write down the correct chemical compound of any scent he came across -- no matter how complex! The book also details the (wait for it) exploitation and competitiveness of the perfume companies at the time with such a man who exists.

goodreads	21366031	1	Sarah	2020-08-05T00:00:00Z	I read this in abbreviated form in a Readers' Digest magazine. Probably in the '80s, possibly later. The book is *not* LouAnne Johnson's 'Dangerous Minds'/'My Posse Don't Do Homework', but is same genre; the author tells her story of taking up a job as headmistress at a no-hope school (I think inner city) and making a difference by her willingness and optimism. Pretty sure it was in the USA. Bits I remember: On the first day, she complains to the janitor about the urine smell in the toilets. He tells her it's soaked so deeply into the floor that there's nothing to be done about it. She proves him wrong by scrubbing the floor herself and getting the smell out. This makes a good impression straight away, because the staff now all know there's no job she considers herself above doing. At one point, someone official who's come in from outside to test the children tests a child who's supposed to be too badly learning disabled to manage in a normal class but was making good progress in such a class with a sympathetic teacher; the tester ignores what the staff have to say about the child's progress and just insists that the child has to be in the class for children with more severe learning disabilities. The teacher who's been teaching the child simply waits until this person has gone and then goes and leads the child out of the other classroom and back to hers. There is some talk near the end about the crack epidemic and how badly prenatal crack exposure is damaging children's brains.

goodreads	21373741	1	Vichitra	2020-08-05T00:00:00Z	Hi , Can anyone help in my search of finding a childrens cookbook that started me on my lifelong love of cooking and food .. I thought it was the best thing ever and must have tried nearly ever single recipe in it .. but can't for the life of me remember the title I know it was orange and white , hardcover, square shaped - probably published in the 80's - 90's ... had pretty exotic ingredients for me back then like carob ( the beginning of the book or maybe it was the end had a glossary of what some ingredients meant and how you could find alternatives) .. I think most of the recipes were really healthy .. there were interesting illustrations inside .. maybe cartoon like characters of kids talking to each other .. there were many recipes that you could have substitutions ie make your own interesting sandwich etc .. as I type this I am sounding more and more vague ... am pretty resigned to the fact that I am never going to find this darned book

goodreads	21379041	1	Kristin Bellamy Crawford	2020-08-05T00:00:00Z	Hi, I believe read this book in 2004 at the latest. It's a non-fiction novel or memoir (possibly YA, but probably not) written by a woman who, as a young girl (around ages 8-12), lived through a war in her home country. I am embarrassed to say I'm not 100% sure which country or which war. I believe it took place in Vietnam during the war in the 1960s/1970s, but may have been another country in Asia such as Cambodia. Or perhaps she moved between countries at some point. I clearly remember: there is a forward in the book where the author talks about how she is certain about every detail she wrote. She specifically says she only wrote what she could remember and didn't change or fluff any details, and that if she couldn't remember something well enough, she left it out completely. I remember being surprised by how much detail she was able to recall so clearly. I also remember for sure: at some point, in the first half of the story, the girl is with her brother. They may have been separated and reunited before this. I believe he is a few years older than her. They are very close. They sleep/hide in a foxhole during the night, and when she wakes up, her brother has died from a stray gunshot wound to his head. She may have been living with a blind, elderly man or woman near the beginning of the story. Or perhaps she was rescued in some way by an elderly person. I think this person later dies, and then the girl is on her own for a time afterward. (This may be when she reunites with her brother, but it could be the opposite... perhaps her brother dies first, and then she meets up with the elderly person). The book cover might have a lot of the color red, or maybe a striking/focal object in red? The girl's coat or something? I remember being struck by just how much this child went through. She escaped/avoided death multiple times. I have the sense that she covered a great distance. I wish I could remember more.

Iâm pretty sure the professor past away too in the last few years because I remember doing a little bit of research on her. I only remember two instances in the book because I did not read that much of it. One she conducted hypnotism on a student and they remembered their life as a bug. It went on to talk about how we start our lives as the very beginning of life as some aspect of the world that keeps it going or something along those lines. Then she conducted hypnotism on another student who remembered their past life as a pregnant prostitute who was beaten to death by their husband. They had to sell their body because that was the only way to make money during that time. Sorry for the gory description that is the only two things that I can remember from it. It was a pretty thick book but I just did not read that much of it. I do not remember the authors name. All I know is that she had written quite a few of them.

goodreads	21490171	1	Carla C	2020-08-05T00:00:00Z	Several years ago, I bought a book that was written by (I think) a Toronto university professor. Each chapter was an analysis/commentary about a novel: Jack Maggs by Peter Carey, The Tortilla Curtain by TC Boyle were two. The essays/chapters were based on a series of in-person lectures he gave annually. I think his first name is Robert (but could be wrong). The book was well-written and led me to read a number of books/authors I normally would not have written. One of his reader-friendly rules was that he waited at least one year until after the book was available in paperback before lecturing about it, in order to give readers the opportunity to buy the lesser-expensive paperback. Does anyone know the title and name of the author? Thanks.

Written by a woman about her early childhood, lots of humor, maybe took place in the South, her mother read all the time, later author realized her mother was probably dealing with mental illness, father took her and her siblings camping in their van all the time.

goodreads	21571651	1	AS	2020-08-05T00:00:00Z	I read this book about ten years ago, and checked it out from the San Francisco Public Library. Oddly, a search on their website turned up nothing that sounded right- it only gave me listings for travel guidebooks for the Trans-Siberian or historical writings about it. The one I am looking for is a relatively recent one- I'd say written in the 1990s at the earliest, but I think early 2000s. Brown cover. The author has some funny anecdotes about Russian tourism officials offering to arrange special excursions and visits for him in the places where he stops along the trip, but almost none of them come through. I especially remember him talking about the food on the train, and how spartan it was, and people he talked to en route. If you think you have an idea, thanks in advance!

goodreads	21573322	1	Natasha Lloyd	2020-08-05T00:00:00Z	I am unsure when I first read this book but I think it was published in the early 2000s based on details I can remember from the book. Was the story of a woman leaving a cult ( I think it was the Family/Children of God but could be mistaken ), and taking her children with her. I think she had four children, and the book detailed both her upbringing, and her plan to leave, I remember a part where she managed to leave for the day in order to go to a book shop and get some literature, and came back and then discussed with her close friend the literature she had found and their future, it was this which was the catalyst for her leaving. Would be grateful for any suggestions as this is driving me nuts!

Late in the hour, just before freetime, I came over and sat down with Sheila to show her how to do a group of new math problems. I took her on my lap. Her body was surprisingly rigid as I held her. I felt her forehead to see if she were hot. But she wasn't. Yet she was certainly acting oddly. """"Is something wrong, Sheil?"""" She shook her head. """"You're all tense."""" """"I'm okay,"""" she reasserted, and returned to the math problems. As the lesson concluded, I lifted her off from my lap to the floor. On the leg of my jeans was a widening red spot. I stared at it not fully comprehending what it was. Blood? I looked at Sheila. """"What on earth is going on?"""" She shook her head, her face emotionless. """"Sheila, you're bleeding!"""" Down the inside of her right pants leg spread a red stain. Picking her up I rushed into the bathroom and shut the door behind us. Unbuckling the overall straps, I let them fall around her ankles. Blood had stained her underpants and ran down both legs. Wadded into her underwear were paper towels. Apparently that had accounted for the numerous trips to the bathroom earlier. She had been trying to staunch the blood flow so that it would not come through and show. """"Good God, Sheila, what is going on?"""" I cried, my voice sounding louder and more alarmed than I had meant it to. Fear rose in me as I pulled away the last of the towels from her clothing. Bright red blood trickled from her vagina. But Sheila stood immutable. No emotion ran across her face. Her eyes were blank, looking at but not seeing me. She was paler than I had thought out in the dimmer classroom light; God, she was white. I wondered how much blood she had lost. In an attempt to wake her out of her stoicism, I grabbed her shoulders and shook her. """"Sheila, what happened? You have to tell me. You can't play games now. What happened to you?"""" She blinked like one coming out of a heavy sleep. She was paying a great price to cut off the pain and the emotion. """"Unca Jerry,"""" she began softly, """"he tried to put his p.e.c.k.e.r in me this morning. But it wouldn't fit. So he tooked a knife. He said I was keeping him out, so he put the knife inside me to make me stop."""" I went numb. """"He put a knife in your vagina?"""" She nodded. """"One of the silverware knives. He said I'd be sorry for not letting him put his pecker in me. He said this'd hurt a whole lot more and I'd be sorry."""" """"Oh God, Sheila, why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you let me know?"""" Fearful that she had already lost too much blood, I wrapped a towel around her and picked her up. """"I's scared to. Unca Jerry told me not to tell. He said he'd do it again if I told on him. He said worser thing would happen if I told."""" You can read the rest here.... https://novelonlinefull.com/chapter/o..."	unusable

I read it in 2005 or 2006, in paperback, and I think it was relatively new at the time, Iâm pretty sure I picked it up off one of the center display tables at Barnes & Noble, probably in NYC. The title was an idiom or play on a common phrase, like âSuffer The Children,â or something like that. I think the title may have had the word âMoralâ in it, but I could be wrong. She discussed lots of specific cases of how churches vilified sexuality, resulting in young adults growing up with unhealthy views of sex and sexuality, unfulfilling sex lives, self-hatred, etc.

goodreads	21597323	1	Aelin	2020-08-05T00:00:00Z	I first came across this author a couple of years ago. There are some 6 or 7 books on the topic by this author. Protagonist works as a counsellor for special children in a normal school. She helps special students to learn by alternate things than books. There are some birds in cages in her class? And studenta feeds them. In one of the books, there is a small girl (11 or 12 yr old ig) who murders a little boy and is caught by the police. She is taken to the protagonist for the time of her sentence and she gets to know the girl and understands why she did that. She starts loving her, and fights for her in the court, because she understands that the girl has a chance in a normal school environment, but if she is confined to juvenile home, she will get worse and there is no scope for her. I also remember the protagonist hasa bf, and she loves these children as her own and always talk to him about them, which he finds endearing, but also sometimes exhausting. It also describes a lot of children with other differences, like there was a child with autism ,and a lot of different types of children, who she cares for in her class. It's a really good read, and teaches you a lot of things about caring for differently abled children.

goodreads	21637751	1	Elizabeth	2020-08-05T00:00:00Z	Hi everyone, this one is kind of a long shot, but here goes: I'm looking for an adult nonfiction book of Christmas crafts. I read it as a kid, in the early to mid 00's, but I don't know whether it was a new book at the time or not. It might have been published as early as the 80's, but I tend to think it would be more in the 1995-2005 range. It was a library book in excellent shape, and I don't remember any of the pictures looking funny or dated, so it was probably fairly recent. The book is divided into different sections. I believe there were only four, although it might have been five. The one I remember most vividly is the Santa chapter. One of the Santa ornaments featured in this section was a long skinny crescent-moon Santa, with the hat going up and the beard coming down. It wasn't round like a circle, but much straighter and possibly rustic-looking. (Faded colors? Wood?) Another Santa from this section was more 3D and doll-like; it had a big fluffy beard that seemed to hang in sections, like banana curls or dreadlocks. (It wasn't banana curls or dreadlocksâI think it was hanging weird because of the material it was made of, but that's kind of what it looked like. I believe this full-bearded Santa was one of the projects featured on the cover, possibly in the lower-left quadrant (but again, I'm not sure). The cover wasn't a single large picture. Rather, it was four small pictures, like a window pane. There may or may not have been something in the center where they connect, and even if there was, I don't know whether it was a fifth image or the title. I believe there were four chapters, and I feel like the separate images represent one craft from each chapter. It was NOT a book specifically about a single type of crafting (e.g., cross stitch). I think it didn't have any recipes. (Maybe a few together in one of the chapters, but I'm pretty sure it was JUST crafts.) It was not based around a single theme (e.g., Vintage decorations). It was decently thick, so I don't think it was one of those magazine specials. It was not intended for children. That is, they're adult-level crafts, and this isn't geared specifically for parents and children together. There are a lot of clear, full-color photos. I don't remember seeing any drawings or black-and-white images, and I don't remember seeing much in the way of patterns or charts. I think there were templates for some of the projects. Other stuff that's vaguely sticking in my mind is a stocking craft and something involving evergreen. (Yeah, sure, as though THAT would narrow it down.) I feel that maybe the stocking was gold? There might have been something with snowmen someone in the book. I think there might have been a glass bauble ornament on the cover. I know this isn't much to go on, but I'd be grateful for any help.				missing link  https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/21637751-solved-adult-nonfiction-christmas-crafts-4-sections-one-was-called

Most craft books are about half an inch thick, and as tall and wide as a magazine, though some get an inch or two thick. The thicker ones tend to be """"greatest hits"""" compilations from their magazines - Better Homes & Gardens, McCall's, etc. WorldCat says about 200 books a year got published with the subject """"Christmas decorations"""" but unfortunately doesn't seem to have many covers, so you're in for a long and tiresome game of search engine musical chairs.

goodreads	21637751	6	Elizabeth	2020-08-05T00:00:00Z	Hi Mai! Thanks for the suggestion. This book is at our local library, so Iâve requested a copy. Itâs definitely similar to what Iâm remembering. If it has a Santa chapter, then Iâll know for sure. Hi Summer! Yes, I tried the library first. Itâs possible that the book was weeded, or that it was lost, or that it was damaged and subsequently removed. Itâs possible that itâs still there and Iâm missing it. As for the decently thick, I donât know the measurement, but it was thicker than many of the others in that section (crafting, 745s). I know that when I borrowed it way back when, there were a LOT of books in that section that looked like magazines. They had magazine titles and were the same height and width; they were also, with few exceptions, skinny. They looked a bit like an actual magazine that had been bound with a hard cover. This book was different from that. I donât remember it having a magazine name at all (although I suppose it could have) but I remember specifically that it was not as skinny as the other magazine books. I donât know if this answers your questions at all, but I appreciate the time youâre taking to help me track this down, so please let me know if I can clarify something further. I know itâs kind of a long shot.

It's new, 2020 and is non-fiction. It is about a woman going through her mother's (who has Alzheimers) belongings, in order to give her things she recognizes to add comfort to her in the care centre, and discovers a photo of her mother in a European (?) street. She recognizes the background as something her grandmother (who has passed) had painted. She asks her uncle why her grandmother did not include her mother in the painting and the mystery deepens.

It's a heartbreaking story written about a young woman suffering with depression, written by her father. One part that stands out is when he goes to her house and finds really expensive biscuits and chocolate scattered about, because she'd taken a fancy to making a chocolate biscuit cake, but never did things by halves and always had to buy the very best ingredients to make it. I think she may also have struggled with anorexia, and ultimately didn't survive the struggle. I'm not sure what year it was published, it's not recent, probably over ten years old now, or around that sort of age.

I spent my childhood reading everything I could get my hands on with regards to ghosts, ghouls, cryptids, monsters, etc. I definitely read The World of the Unknown and various Hamlyn books on the topics. The book I am searching for comes from a series of paperback, non-fiction books. I believe there was a lengthy series of these books - I seem to remember there being similar books in the series on all sorts of topics: dinosaurs, prehistoric animals, the Ancient Greeks, and so on. The books were sized about 2/3 of an A4 sheet and were not very thick. They were entirely illustrated - I don't remember there being any photos at all. The books were likely published in the 70s. The specific book I am looking for, I cannot remember the name. The two elements I do remember are: - The cover. This was gloomy, illustrated/painted cover. It showed a scene at night. In the sky above, there were the faces of a vampire and a witch as well as another creature I cannot remember. It's likely the book was named """"Vampires and Other Monsters"""" or similar. - An inner spread. This contained various water demons, including a Will O' The Wisp and a Kappa. The kappa illustration was strange in that it appeared to have an almost barrel like body. I know this is not much to go on but I've searched and searched: it doesn't appear to be Hamlyn, Usborne, Armada or Fontana, all of whom seem to have published similar books to these. ANY and all help will be most appreciated. Thanks to all!"				https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/21708937-solved-70s-paperback-nonfiction-book-on-vampires-demons-witches-etc--

I remember very little except that she was a champion hot dog eater, had a mouth like a sailor, and died due to impalement at the end (super weird and morbid, I know). Also there was a bit in there about how she was obsessed with the name Jesus, and at one point the man gives the neighbourhood children a speech about how Jesus was a carpenter and so had to have huge muscles because was chopping wood all day. Honestly can't even remember if the book was good or not, I think probably not in reading this summary back, but it's stuck in my brain now and if I can't figure out the name I'll go mad.

Inside cover: two blonde sisters holding small Celtic harps, painting - looks like medieval stained glass painting. In the story one has to marry very young. Once wed, they did not consummate the marriage as he did not want to get married in the first place and she was so young. She is left behind with his family -I think- and not treated very fairly with them. Once he returns, he wishes to have more of a marriage but they have trouble consummating, as she is very afraid. She's known to have the ability to see in the future, every time they are together she feels/sees that she's drowning and believes that being with him will bring about her death. I believe that there are some lies being involved with his family, but I do not remember. Book cover is a painting of both girls/sisters, without definition of shadow and light like other book covers or a recreated photo.

This is a newish memoir, I'd say pubbed within the last 3 years, about a woman who finds out her husband is a child molester. Not a spoiler, since the reader goes in knowing that. The husband didn't molest their own kids, as far as I can recall. I believe he targeted children through his work, I think at a school or church. The memoir is about the woman getting her life back and how her community rallied around her. It may have been a Christian book, not sure on that. I was positive the book had something like """"awful"""" or """"terrible"""" in the title, along the lines of """"Something Terrible Happened,"""" but I'm not finding it.

I think it had a brownish cover. I never read it, though he raved about it - he was single and it made him look at women differently. I got the impression from him, from the back cover, and from reviews at the time that it was similar to """"Men are from Mars..."""" in a sense - but more focused on women.

goodreads	21743983	1	Barbara Treen	2021-08-05T00:00:00Z	This book is the memoirs of a man's life at sea, during the age of sail, as a ship's carpenter. He is a count, and an artist, but joins the merchant marines with a friend. The book is about his adventures on different ships, some good, some bad, and some horrific. At one point, he is trapped in an Asian country during a cholera epidemic, and watches the ship's crew die. He (obviously) survives. The advent of steamships ends his career as a carpenter, and he retires.

goodreads	21743983	3	Barbara Treen	2021-08-05T00:00:00Z	I read this in the mid '70's, probably 1973 to 1974. The book takes place in the late 1800's to early 1900's, when ships still sailed by wind, before steamships took over. The count's name was French, but he was either an naturalized American or Canadian citizen. It was not a novel or fiction, it was the memoirs of his years at sea. There was a photo near the beginning of the book of his merchant marine license. The book was published in the early 1900's or around 1920 to 1930's, perhaps.

It is totally possible that the book is older than those years though based on how school libraries donât always get new books. It was smaller in size than a typical book and was mostly full of pictures. I believe it was paperback, but the cover was a bit thicker/more durable than most paperbacks. I checked it out all the time for the beautiful photos in it. If I remember right, it was mostly pictures of a bird, with a column on the right explaining where it lives and diet and things like that. I remember there were North American birds in it because my mom and I would look for them, but I cannot say for certain that it was only a book on North American birds. I remember there were also other volumes of this series on different topics (weather/clouds, rocks, and flowers) if that helps for tracking this one down. I donât remember what the cover looks like but I can remember the page set-up. Please help me find it, thank you!

The boy (or his friend?) shot one of the girls in the guest house where she lived and went on the run. But the kids parents werenât involved with any of them, they all drank and did drugs and were like misfits with how they dressed and acted but the parents were all rich and really well off so the kids just spent money and basically lived on their own. So theyâre all hanging out one night and one of the girls (or maybe 2) get shot in the back of the head by one or both boys. Then the 2 boys go on the run but get caught. I think it was set somewhere with warm weather? Florida or California? But that could be wrong. I remember the girls were sitting on the floor at the foot of the bed and they were shot from behind, possibly shotgun? One of the girls was really small and had a partially shaved head, I think they called her tinkerbell or bell? Any help at all would be appreciated! Thanks!

I think he lives with his grandparents and his mother, or a grandparent and his mother? Sort of dysfunctional household I think? Tone/genre is realistic fiction, extremely well-written. Set 20 to 50 years ago (sorry for the broad range).

The narrator receives mysterious post of a kind of hand bound cryptic book wrapped in newspaper. He then discovers that other people have received the same book. I think they are all intellectuals from all different fields?? So they feel like theyâve been presented with a mystery to solve. I think the conclusion is that the book is in fact nonsense and there is no mystery. For some reason I have it in my head that it is magical realism, but I might be mixing it up.

goodreads	21772039	1	Florence	2021-08-05T00:00:00Z	I had a book in the late 90s-mid 00s which may have been part of a craft kit or have come with some supplies. It was primarily about making braided friendship bracelets but also had some other things. I specifically remember instructions for a type of love fortune telling, using playing cards and stacking them in piles based on how many letters were in your crushes name I think? You went through and discarded pairs of cards I think and your fortune was told in the cards left. This book was around A4 size, paperback and quite thin. I believe it was illustrated rather than having photographs in. It was very pink and purple and âgirlyâ in style.

I barely remember the story but the one of the main points that stuck out is that these wolves recognized their mates through a handshake which triggered a mating mark or something to that effect on the palm? The story takes place in a corporate setting, the son who is set to inherit must marry, i think the company needed money sonit was supposed to be a marriage of convenience. I honestly cant remember the details bc of reader burn out but i think the whole handshake printing thing is not common in shifter stories plus the whole corporate setting. Thenone thing i do know is that ill definitely recognize it if im lucky enough that one of you find it. Thanks in advance! And again, its an MM shifter story.

goodreads	21795997	1	Lauren Pittard	2021-08-05T00:00:00Z	This is an adult non-fiction book with a focus on humour, travel, and biography. A young man goes through a break up (the break up part might not be correct, but thatâs how I remember it) and so books himself a little holiday. When he arrives at the transport, he realises heâs booked himself onto a senior citizen coach trip and heâs youngest person in the group by a country mile. He then makes friends with all of the older people on the coach, and the book is largely about the friendships he makes, the lives and antics of the people on the bus, and the trips they all take together (as he travels with them more than once in the end).

It's a short manga, either oneshot or a couple of volumes only. It's complete. The plot is about a girl in her early 20s or late teens who meets by chance a guitar player. She has trouble at home, so she sticks with him. They stay in a big home and he also has trouble (depression or drug abuse?)... the topics are tough but it's romanticized, in a kind of """"we've found each other"""" way. Then flash back to the present, the girl is a ghost (who only remembers the guy vaguely), the guitar dude disappeared, and some school kids find the house.

goodreads	21840312	1	Smriti	2021-08-05T00:00:00Z	"Looking for a comedic memoir about an implied gay man. Read the book back in 2015 at a library in Alberta, Canada. The book was about medium length, probably 150-250 pages long with a white cover. The book already seemed a little old at the time I borrowed it so it might be about 10 years+ right now. The author of the book was likely either Canadian or American, I am leaning towards Canadian from what I can remember. The memoir featured one particular anecdote that I remember really clearly (SPOILER WARNING BELOW): The authors younger self (probably 8-12 years old) is sitting on the steps of his house watching a couple construction workers. The kid focuses mainly on one who is operating a tractor and seems to hold some degree of awe or amazement at the worker. He apparently watches the construction workers for a couple days before the one that he seems most in awe of starts making kind gestures to the kid. Playing with and interacting with him in a friendly way. The construction worker at one point lets the kid look at and play around in the tractor before realizing the kid is a young boy instead of a young girl like he had assumed (likely due to the kids long hair). After that the construction worker stops interacting with the child and the kid is left friendless again. From what I remember it was implied the authors younger self had some mild """"celebrity"""" worship or a mini crush on the worker. The worker was aware of and humored the crush until realizing the 'little girl' was actually a 'little boy' at which point he stopped humoring the kids crush. I also believe that later on the author himself or the authors partner are implied to be working as jewelers. One of them makes the other and himself an engagement ring. The fact that they're implied to be married makes me believe the author is probably a Canadian but it could be married religiously or something without any of the legal rights.

The time period and everything match up.	confirmed			
goodreads	21842068	1	Elizabeth âSmart Girls Love Trashy Booksâ	2021-08-05T00:00:00Z	Don't know how easy this one will be to track down but I've been longing to try more recipes from it and haven't found the exact one yet. I randomly found it at my great-grandmother's house back in 2009/2010 but it had to have been much older. Hardback, not a lot of pages probably only around sixty, cover was a very dark colour like red or brown that didn't give off cookbook vibes, I don't even think it had a picture on it. What the actual book was, it was a cookbook about how to make basically any kind of food using your microwave. I think it was split into breakfast lunch dinner possibly dessert too. There were pictures in it of different food; the quality of them as well as the topic makes me heavily believe this was published in the 80's because microwaves were a new invention and everyone loved them. What I remember most is the gimmick; you could make literally anything you could think of in the microwave following the instructions, even a cake! That image has stuck with me to this day. I also strongly remember a recipe for scrambled eggs because I actually did that one and they tasted like they had been cooked on the stove, hence why I want to try more recipes out. If it helps, my great-grandmother was living in Mississippi at the time. Here's to hoping it can be found!

Were the pages glossy or matte? You mentioned that there were pictures inside of the dishes. Were the pictures in color or black and white? Photographs or drawings? Given how short you remember it being, I wonder if it could've been a book that came with the microwave or was put out by a microwave company. Even if you don't remember a brand, do you remember if there was a brand name somewhere on that?				
goodreads	21842068	4	Elizabeth âSmart Girls Love Trashy Booksâ	2021-08-05T00:00:00Z	It was a medium-sized book, like not super big but I could hold it comfortably, and square-shaped. It didn't look anything like you'd expect a cookbook to look. The pages were matte but they also could've been a bit glossy. The pictures were actual pictures, photographs of the dishes, and in colour. I don't recall it having to do with any brand but I wouldn't be surprised if it was used for promotion given the era

Most likely the book was written during the 1st decade of the 2000's. The author (male) tells the story of his experience leaving his current role (which I believe is a journalist) and testing whether the American dream is still alive. In the story, he moves to another city, starts from scratch with very little money in his pocket and goes through the trial and tribulations of trying to make a living for himself without using his college degree to secure a job. The author ultimately ends up working for a moving company as a mover. He tells the story of how he saves money, makes financially sound decisions that help him grow his net worth, and start climbing the """"social mobility"""" ladder. I believe the author was working as a mover for about a year."

One of his owners is an author and is the one writing the story. His owner is gay and married to another man. I think the setting is set in a European country and not America but I could be wrong about that. I read the book years ago in my early teen years, maybe around 2012. The plot was about the cat seeing the world through his perspective. He has a sarcastic, opinionated voice and """"adopted"""" his owners by just walking into their house one day. The book also touches on the struggles his owners face by being gay men in a world where that isn't mainstream. There are other cat characters that pop up from the cat's previous life of being a stray. The story ends with him being taken to the vetertinary office to be euthanized because of health issues due to old age.

It was most likely a part of a series, either labelled as volumes or each book had a subtitle regarding the time frame (example: 1776 - 1850 or 1890 - 1950). This textbook wasn't a straightforward narrative written by one author. It was a compilation of chapters (or essays) written by different authors. That is if I'm remembering it right. And some of these writing would be interesting to read again. So here is what I remember: there was an essay on Orson Welles' broadcast of """"War Of The Worlds"""" and the sociological reaction it had on its listeners, as well as the fallout that ensued. There was an essay on John Wayne's image and how he always struggled with the fact he couldn't serve in the military during U.S. wartime and was kept home to work as a """"public figure"""" (there may have been mentions of Elvis Presley struggling with this limitation as well- both men wanted to serve). Lastly, there was a detailed essay about Andrew Jackson's duel with Charles Dickinson (I believe) and how Dickinson slowly died from his injuries while Jackson decided to be a total asshole about it. In spite of deep searches on the web, Google Books, World Cat and the Library of Congress, I haven't had much luck finding anything about this book. Its title was very generic, like """"American Civilization"""" or """"American History,"""" something obvious like that. I believe the author (more likely editor) was male, or that there were multiple people involved in publication. More info: the cover was black on its top half with '90s era white text and the bottom half was a gridded collage of different historical figures. There were red and blue accents to designate which book was what (most likely chronologically). The book was a heavy paperback, approximately 10"""" square and several hundred pages.

The cover had a photo of the murdered/missing woman on it from when she was a teenager, she was blonde and pretty. When the author knew the victim, she was living with a guy who either was her step father, or said he was her step father. Later she ended up having a child by him (the step father dude) and I think he made her work as a stripper. She and her young son either disappeared completely or were murdered and the case is unsolved (I can't recall which) and it seems the step father dude did it. The guy who wrote the book was friends with the victim in high school. in the book he talks about what a sweet, fun girl she was, but she wasn't allowed to do much. And I believe he discusses how he regrets not trying to help her when they were teenagers. She may have gone missing in Florida but again, I can't be sure. Thank you in advance!

Book details: * The book is written from the man and women's perspective. *They save up for about year before the man quits his job. *They retrofit the boat to make it kid friendly. They get noticed/made fun of often for the flotation devices they put all around the boat. * They talk about anchoring near Paris and about travelling along the Mediterranean Sea * The book is not the following titles: South from Alaska, Into The Light, All in The Same Boat, or any of the books from the Gifford sailing family. Hope this is enough information. Any suggestions would be helpful! Thank-you!

goodreads	21912798	1	Sabina	2021-06-27T00:00:00Z	I read the book around 2011/2012. I think it was quite newly published back home (Eastern Europe). The book was translated and in my native language the title had something to do with photograph/photographer. A good â of the book is set in the wild west around the time pf the civil war (if I remember correctly) and the rest in present-time UK. The book starts in present day, with a female (?) character traveling to the countryside to find out more about her family/history. She has a picture of a woman and her baby, taken in the 19th century. The story then mostly focuses on the past, presenting this womanâs journey, how that picture came to be and how it links to the present-time storyline. I remember the past storyline to take place in america in the wild west/texas-y area, perhaps around the civil war period (could be before/after). I remember the storylines featuring native americans (as it was the wild west) and traveling gypsys (as the other storyline was in UK) Iâve been trying to wreck by mind in remembering what the book was called as I would LOVE to reread it. I am super thankful to all! If anything else comes to mind I will update!!

She's saved by two beings, one who is basically Regiice, since they are a crystalline, sentient mass of ice, and the other who is not that, but whose features I do not recall. Spoiler Warning further down! They're traveling together and they find this massive area that's supposed to be an ocean, but it's all dried up. I don't remember a whole lot about what happens or what she's trying to do, except get home, but by the end of the book I think the planet blows up or is destroyed in some way. I think her father dies or was already dead as well, but I'm not sure. The book's cover had a man's face i think? Overlayed with a space background. I can't remember if butterflies were on the cover as well, but I feel like there were. I read it in early to mid 2000's but the book is probably much older than that, since it had an old-timey sci-fi book feel to it.

goodreads	21914201	5	mallizard	2025-06-05T00:00:00Z	I read the book in high school, but the memory of the cover and the way the book was formatted makes me think it's more for adults. The father's job is... some kind of scientist, I think? It's how she ends up being able to be transported to another world. And I think he's missing? And she goes looking for him only to end up being sent through the same kind of portal or strange thing to end up in the icy planet? I can't remember how they ended up traveling specifically, but when she gets to the icy planet she gets buried under a lot of snow and it talks a lot about slowly succumbing to hypothermia before she's dug out and rescued by the two beings that end up becoming her friends.

goodreads	21928631	1	Robyn	2021-08-05T00:00:00Z	Iâm pretty sure itâs by someone famous. Itâs set in a 1600-1900 time period i believe. The main character is a boy who is sent to a orphanage. He meets a boy who cannot sleep because evil creatures( i canât remeber there names) are after him and they prey on asleep people.They boy notices this and tries to help him. They are looking for the leader of the evil group. They think itâs this mean orphanage boy he TW drove a person to su1c1de. Itâs revealed thatâs itâs not the boy but the evil leader is actually the main character. He doesnât know this and lost his memories. They locked him up and i canât remember what happened to him but i vividly remember it is revealed that the twin of the boy who canât sleep died years before in the fire that kills there parents and there is a imposter. It is then implied she set the orphanage and everyone in it on fire. I read this a couple of years ago and it was so weird i want to reread. I cant remember the name but i can the plot. Iâm pretty sure it was published quite a while ago as well.

In a later scene, he describes story of a local man who had been bullied by another, until he called him out and killed him in a fight with machetes. In another scene, the newly-arrived police officer visits the American's farm. The farmer's wife is chasing a chicken, to prepare for a hospitable meal for the policeman, who politely tells the wife it is too hot for her to be chasing a chicken for him, and asks her instead to point out the chicken she was trying to catch. She does so, and the policeman, quite proud of his shooting skill, fast-drew his .38 Super automatic, and shot the chicken's head off, as a chivalric favor. I remember quite a few things from the book, but not the title, or author's name. Thanks!

The cover was white with an illustration on it that looked like a Renaissance painting, with his name in golden lettering. Topics included: original manuscripts being mistranslated due to a lack of vowels, and the author made a joke about a game show. Jesus likely walked on water at low tide and across salt deposits, was another topic. The slaughter of the first-born sons was because they all tended to work long hours in fields where they were prone to an illness going around.

goodreads	21971365	1	Judy	2021-08-05T00:00:00Z	Hi, Looking for the name of a kids book I read to my oldest and he loved back in the 90's. It was a kid's Halloween book we found at the library, but it was dated, drawings looked like 80's or 70's. It was about kids getting dressed up to go trick or treating, with Marzipan candy somewhere mentioned. Like to find it for this son's son, my grandson, so I can share with him.

The first chapter is talking about trigonometry and each chapter builds up into more complex concept. The overall plot is describing the universe through number theory. I remember it said in the back that the author was Nobel laureates but I dont know in what subject. My bet is physic or math. I dont know what year did he win either. The book cover shows spiral shell that resemble golden ratio. The book binder side is orange like the usual penguin book. Thank you for looking at my post. I missed that book so much.

The story is 1st person from a young manâs perspective - he may have a dog and motorcycle - and is set in the city. He finds a little girl who has been abandoned and takes her back to where he lives, and when his housekeeper(?) is washing her they see that she has been beaten. She has a joy of discovery and they go on adventures and at one point he makes her a âmirror bookâ out of two small cosmetic mirrors. At the end of the story she has an accident (falls on some railings?) and dies in his arms. Quite poetic and âmoodyâ in a 1970s way, possibly incorporating discussions between them about God.

This story takes place in a historical setting with nobles and mansions etc. It was about a young boy, who I believe was an orphan, that had a mentor who was a painter. His mentor was getting very old and sick, and on his deathbed he told his apprentice to finish the last commission he had. So the boy (I'll refer to him as ML from now on) went to the family who commissioned his mentor. They doubt his identity at first as he is a young child (he might be 16-18) but somehow he verifies his identity. He had the letter that his mentor had that described the commission, so it might've been that with a seal or something. The job is to paint the noble family's daughter. The portrait is for her 16th birthday debut. So everyday, ML goes to this house and paints her for quite a few hours everyday. They bond and eventually fall in love, but though the girl's parents don't mind, they know that this marriage can never happen in the eyes of society. SPOILERS AHEAD: So they end up faking the daughter's death and they move to a village area. She changes her name to Anna or Hannah. ML and her live out their peaceful happy lives in the village and Anna/Hannah's family come to visit every so often. The very end of the manhwa shows the painting that ML did as the commission in an art museum with a lady explaining that this was the mentor's last painting, but some people debate about it (since ML took the commission under his mentor's name and his style is so close to his mentor, historians couldn't tell the difference). And then you see a painting in a different hall with the girl again and the caption is """"My Dear Hannah"""" by """"unknown artist"""" which of course is by ML and is of his wife. The style of the art is more on the realistic style I believe. The overall vibes remind me of Winter Woods on webtoons.com by COSMOS and VAN.J. I think the girl had a younger sister. I don't recall ML's appearance too much, but I know the girl is a brunette with long hair. ML is probably brunette or black hair as well."	unusable			webtoon

It was a book about vampires but it was very different from other vampire books. The name of the main vampire was Adam. The main girl was in a party at the house of (i think) her professor where she meets Adam. Their relationship starts but one day some people attack them. After this scary thing the main girl runs away and leaves him. Some time later Adam finds her. At this point Adam is very angry with her and wants revenge but not in a bloody way. And than i think they were kidnapped by a weird creature. These are all the thing i remember. I'm sorry that it's not much. As i said, i read it years ago and i have no idea about the title, author or even the names of the characters. I hope somebody knows this book.

It turns out I wasn't able to find it because I was looking for it in English speaking countries. But when I found the book I saw that it is a book that was written in German. Moreover, I wasn't able to find an english translation of it online or in websites like Goodreads so it may never have been translated.

This was in my dad's bookshelf when I was growing up in the 70's, although most of his books were from the 1950's It was a paperback. I have not a clue what the title was. The book was like a non-fiction choose-your-own-adventure. You'd start reading and then you'd make a choice what to do next. But I think the whole purpose was to teach your psychological lessons. I think there might have been a short quiz at the beginning (maybe) and then you'd start on some River path. I remember the Monongahela was one of them. I believe they were all East Coast rivers. You'd read a page or two, and it would say, """"Do you do X or Y"""" and that would direct you to another page in the book so you'd be skipping around in it. I think in some of the paths you could die, but I'm not sure. It could also be straight NF with no fiction element. I think it was written in 2nd person. It was definitely for adults, and it was too """"deep"""" for someone my age, but I was fascinated by it.

It was the type put out by Parents Magazine Press (see A Children's Guide to Knowledge for similar style). It had illustrations of things like recognizing rashes like poison ivy, childhood illnesses, how to treat a snakebite, etc. I'd love to have a copy for my shelves.

I asked my older brother about it and he said he thought it was part of a Better Homes and Gardens set. I tried to look that up and can only find the white BHG first aid book. Again, not sure if it is helpful- but it may be the same book I'm thinking of and, if not, BHG- maybe something similar- and maybe part of a book set?

It contained autobiographical essays by several Olympic athletes explaining their Olympic journey or their most famous contribution to Olympic history. I don't remember who all the athletes were, but I know Dick Fosbury was for sure one of them. His essay was all about how he accidentally created the Fosbury Flop, which has now become the standard technique for the high jump. He mentioned that the first time he did it in competition the coaches from other countries were desperately searching the rulebooks to see if his technique was illegal, but found nothing, and so he won gold. Another essay (I don't remember which athlete) kept repeating the phrase """"How bad do you want it?"""" (the book is NOT How Bad Do You Want It? by Matt Fitzgerald, I checked). This athlete wrote that phrase on his bedroom ceiling so that he would see it every time he woke up and remember to keep training hard. Also, I have the strong feeling that beach volleyball champion Karch Kiraly was one of the featured athletes, but I don't remember the specifics of his essay."

Anyway, the details I can remember are limited, but here they are: 4 teenagers - 2 boys, 2 girls They killed one of the girls family Setting was small town There was a gothic or vampire element - I think there may have been some drinking of blood involved The girl whose family was murdered - I seem to remember the author sharing some of her thoughts after they ran away - and that she was already having doubts There may have been domestic violence in one of the boys families One of the boys killed one of her parents, but I think I remember that she killed her little brother I think I remember them hiding in a car (???) for a while - like in a field?

From what I recall, It is about a girl who is treated badly and basically rejected by her werewolf pack and the alpha or his son is the worst, because of something her dad or her mom or both of her parents did in the past. And since one or both of them is gone she receives the brunch of the disdain of her pack. At her coming of age she transforms for the first time, it is discovered that she is the alpha's son's destined mate. She hope's that means things will finally start to turn around for her - because she was his mate, surely he would protect now, right? However, he rejects her in front of the entire pack. Her wolf spirit can't handle the rejection and she starts to die. Until the spirit/god/protector/deity of werewolves appears and decides to take her as his mate. And that is all I can remember.

But, in the great texts of that discourse, these writers downplayed a crucial requirement for capitalismâs creation: For it to succeed, peasants would have to abandon their self-sufficient lifestyle and go to work for wages in a factory. Why would they willingly do this? Clearly, they did not go willingly. As Michael Perelman shows, they were forced into the factories with the active support of the same economists who were making theoretical claims for capitalism as a self-correcting mechanism that thrived without needing government intervention. Directly contradicting the laissez-faire principles they claimed to espouse, these men advocated government policies that deprived the peasantry of the means for self-provision in order to coerce these small farmers into wage labor. To show how Adam Smith and the other classical economists appear to have deliberately obscured the nature of the control of labor and how policies attacking the economic independence of the rural peasantry were essentially conceived to foster primitive accumulation, Perelman examines diaries, letters, and the more practical writings of the classical economists. He argues that these private and practical writings reveal the real intentions and goals of classical political economyâto separate a rural peasantry from their access to land."""""	unusable	The Invention of Capitalism: Classical Political Economy and the Secret History of Primitive Accumulation	27284	by Michael Perelman

From what I can remember, this is not your normal fiction book with these issues woven into the plot, but a written dialogue of a group of 5-6 teenagers discussing issues all young people face. Each chapter would have the teenagers discuss a topic such as eating disorders or self-harm. One of the teens would always have a personal relationship with the issue. In the eating disorder chapter, a girl mentions that when she heard her mom and sister complain about their bodies, she thought """"Wow, I must be a whale.""""

It was so old that it was a different size than our current (American) bills, so he had a difficult time getting a bank to accept it. I believe he also briefly wrestled with the idea of returning the money to the family that used to own the house, but decided against it pretty quickly.

After endless google searches using what I could remember, I've come up empty. The book centered around a family living in Summit County and Medina County, Ohio sometime in the 1970s/1980s. The family also spent time somewhere in Florida. There were many children in the family and the patriarch was a terrible man who commited unspeakable acts upon his children, wife, and others. The daughters were forced into ceremonies to """"marry"""" the father. I recall one or two daughters spoke up to a frined or counselor at school. There was an older son who married and him and his wife had a baby who was somehow murdered and the patriach was involved in both the death and the coverup. I don't recall much else, just that the story was so horrifying. Growing up in that area of Ohio, the book referenced a number of areas I am familiar with, making it that much more terrifying.

The cover had the 'obnoxious' title in large font -- something like the Big Giant Encyclopedia of Unusual Things -- this is not it, but it was something extreme I think. But it was mainly covered with these late 70s/mid 80s illustrations -- kind of ugly looking characters with exaggerated features . I think it could have been updated and released every few years perhaps? Each entry did have a description of a new 'thing' and then the contact details for various groups to mail or call. The things included topics like bee collecting, how to make a fabulous paper-plane, and just other oddities. I honestly, don't recall much more unfortunately."

I remember a lot of small details about the book, but nothing that gives me results on any search engine. I am almost positive the title is just the one word that is the name of the magical portal land and it definitely sounds something like shatakura (however helpful that is). The main character is a girl who I'm pretty sure has red hair and her guy best friend is heavily involved. In the beginning she's in the woods behind her house with her best friend who has a boring name and somehow or other she gets covered in a pile of rocks and is going to die unless she can get out. Somehow she does escape and there's this gem or stone she earns from having survived the rocks. There are more elemental-related trials that she survives (almost drowning in water) and discovers more stones. Eventually she discovers this cave I believe and she needs the stones to get into this magical world. This series also involves trolls (?) that try to get her and at one point they capture her friends or are her friends in disguise?

To clarify, the people are real, but the obituaries written about them are fictional. Basically, the author wanted to use the obituary format to explore the complicated legacy of various historical figures or celebrities. I know one of these obituaries was about the guy who invented the AK-47, Mikhail Kalashnikov.

goodreads	22050386	1	Stacy	2022-06-27T00:00:00Z	"Hi! I read this book sometime in the mid 1980s-early 1990s. I think. Certainly well before 2000. It was a standard-length paperback, a sort of """"western"""" cowboy type of scene on the front, very bright blue sky. One of the main characters in the lower left, iirc. This was set in roughly modern times, in the desert of the US Southwest or maybe Mexico. Very """"urban fantasy"""" style. Someone somehow woke or summoned Quetzalcoatl. I *think* a necklace or pendant was involved, but not sure. This is key - he could speak, and was kind of a smart a$$. I don't think he realized who he was at first, and grew. Eventually toward the end of the book, his nemesis Smoking Mirror was summoned or found him, and they had a fight as huge flying dragons."

goodreads	22050386	3	Stacy	2022-06-27T00:00:00Z	sorry it's taken me so long to reply. It's been a long time, but I think there are both male and female characters. I don't recall the POV I think most were high school age- or maybe young adults. Fairly certain they were collectively on some kind of desert ranch type of place.

""""A sexy witch who writes romances and a police detective who sees more than mortal man team up to battle an ancient Aztec god! Dallas Police Detective Mark Valdez isn't just any cop, he's a psychic who knows that the cattle mutilations and torture murders he's been investigating are somehow tied together. He also knows that his meager psychic abilities aren't enough to identify the killers, much less stop them. Luckily, Mark has an ace up his sleeve: an attractive young romance novelist who happens to be a practicing witch. And not just any witch, either-Diana Tregarde is a Guardian, charged with protecting the Earth and all its creatures. Using modern science and ancient magics, Diana and Mark discover that they are tailing no ordinary serial killer but the awakened avatar of an Aztec god. Tezcatlipoca and his four beautiful handmaidens are preparing for a great sacrifice that will transform North America into a new Aztec realm. Diana isn't sure her powers are strong enough to take on those of a risen Aztec god, but she has no choice. As a Guardian, she is sworn to protect mankind, even at the cost of her own life. Luckily, she does not stand alone. Mark Valdez is more than just a cop. And Tezcatlipoca is not the only Aztec god walking in the world."""""

Remembering more details about the cover - in a lower corner was a Latina woman in a white dress, with her arms up to protect her face.

goodreads	22068783	1	Amanda	2022-08-05T00:00:00Z	Need help to find this author/book combo. My mother had it when my brother was born in â78, told me she had it when I was born in â73. I read it a hundred times at least. Stories written by Doctor about his time caring for dangerously ill premature babies from their birth onward in the babiesâ ICU. (Donât think is was call or referred to as the NICU in this book, like that department is called now.) Loaned it to a good friend when she became pregnant, and she never gave it back. Very special to me! Was a small, slender, hardcover book, with a plain light brown/cream/beige cover with green embossed title, in a sort of cursive-style font. Book originally bought in Michigan, USA. This book made a profound impact on me and I was heartbroken when my friend seemingly stole it. Life made it so I cannot have children on my own, so it is very important for me to find this book again to connect with my childhood, and my mother. You are my last hope to find this!

I used to read this in the public library while I waited for my mom to pick me up after school. It was a collection of fun synopses of classic literature in just a few sentences, or a poem, or things like that. I remember the entry for """"The Bridge of San Luis Rey"""" particularly. It was a poem. The place: Peru. The time: long gone. A bridge of rope much traveled on Goes crashing down. Five natives die. God's will, or chance? These five- but why? Survivors tell, each one, a tale Of hope and love, joy and travail Whose summing up reveals no plan To justify God's ways to Man But this: We're loved a while and then forgotten Both by gods and men But when our lives are sacrificed Love, itself, will have sufficed. There's a bit more, but my memory gets too foggy after 35+ years to pull it forward. I don't recall if the whole book was poetry about classic literature, or if there was some prose mixed in, but it was all in the vein of boiling down those books we all should be familiar with into bite-sized nuggets of knowledge. To this day I have never read The Bridge of San Luis Rey, but I feel I know exactly what the themes of the novel are due to this book and the above-referenced poem. Any leads on finding this? Now that I actually have read a lot more classic literature than I ever had as a young teenager, I'd like to see if the entries stand up. Possibly totally wrong, but in my dusty memory the cover had a cartoony drawing of William Shakespeare with a quill in his hand..."

Adult in nature, It was a full colour large-format hardback photo book about death (that is, death of humans), in all its gory/horrific forms. I THOUGHT it was called 'Book of Death' or something very similar but am struggling to find it.

They protect demons/creatures from humans who dont know they exist. In the house you can rent a room. But the demons who stay there have some kind of bounty on them (if i remember correctly). The girl can fight and meets the (black) dragon boy in the inn. Later on she meets his incubus(succubus) friend (boy and red hair if im correct). This friend is a seducer and can do some magic. Later on they flee from the inn and somewhere in the book they go to some kind of bar. In all the books there were fight scenes and escapes|( i know not very abnormal in these books). i also believe there was some kind of otherworld/underworld. The author is female (not 100% sure) and i guess the books were published from 2010 or later.

goodreads	22091255	1	Eyelovebooks	2022-06-27T00:00:00Z	This is an adult fiction book that centers around 3 women. Two of the women are black and 1 of the women is white. The plot centered around the theme of having children/not having children to having a sense of fulfillment. The 2 black women are friends at the beginning of the book. One of the black women wants children, but I believe either her spouse doesn't want children at all or she can't have children and she may want to adopt. She also owns a hair salon where I believe the other two women are her employees. The second black woman I believe wants children, but cant have children because years ago she had an abortion that caused issue for her to conceive again. The white woman is a stripper (or was a stripper and stopped due to her husband and becoming a mother) that has two children, boy and a girl. She did not want children, but had them to please her husband. The only 2 things she love are being a stripper and her husband. The white woman starts working at the shop and the women become friends The ending of the book included the white woman children and husband was in a (house or building) fire. The husband tried to save both children, but only the daughter survived. The woman was devastated only or mostly because her husband died. No longer needing to be a mom to please her husband, she left her surviving child with the owner of the salon so she could raise her daughter and left towns. I think to become a stripper again. The woman of the salon was now happy to have a child to raise. I forgot what happen to the other black woman's situation, but all three women were happy with their decisions at the end I believe this book was written anytime in the 90's reply | edit | delete | flag *

My mom had multiple books from the series, so even the series title would be super helpful! Again, these were aimed at girls from age like 10ish, 11, up through freshman year of HS.

goodreads	22110413	1	Jan	2022-08-05T00:00:00Z	Hi Yâall! Iâm not sure if this book is in print anymore but I would love to at least know the title so I can hunt down a used version! My grandfather used to have this book about flowers with beautiful illustrations. It was about the size of a pocket book and came in one of those pretty protective boxes that was a copy of the cover. It was very warm colors and glossy. I canât remember the exact title but I think it was along the lines of love language of flowers and/or the love stories of flowers. It had each little story connected to the flower, with a painted picture of the flower, the love scene, the love story and then a general description of the meaning. What seems to set it apart from similar books in the story of the forget-me-nots, which features the story where a knight goes to pick the flower for a lady/princess but falls into the raging river and due to his armor is unable to get out and is carried away; he shouts as he is swept away âforget me not!â. This apparently is not the common story shared about forget me nots so Iâm hoping this will help as I donât remember the other stories as well. Thank you for your help â¤ï¸

The book is about a group of male friends from high school up until they grow up and have kids too. Trey dies near the end of the novel, and the narrator thinks, """"We would have invited Ginger's dad (to the funeral), but...you know..."""" Ginger's dad had been part of the friends group when they were younger. They didn't invite him to Trey's funeral because Trey sexually assaulted Ginger when she was thirteen and he was forty. Her parents had her testify in court, and she was furious and didn't want to be there. The defense was a tall, skinny man. """"What's your name?"""" he asked. She said her name, which I don't remember, and said, """"But my friends call me Ginger."""" """"Okay, Ginger--"""" """"I didn't say you could call me Ginger."""" Silence, and then questions about what happened with Trey. She didn't view what happened to her as sexual assault: """"Because I had the biggest boobs in seventh grade and I wanted to fuck. He asked and I was fine with getting into bed with him."""" She was maybe fourteen or fifteen while testifying. She had red hair, was pale and had freckles, and was wearing a white button-down while testifying. Before she testified, the narrator mentioned one of the guys' mother as they were teens. """"We all thought as teenagers that Mrs. (Last Name, possibly Daniels) was hot. We asked Trey about it. He was more into the girls at our private school, the whole schoolgirl thing."""" Really? They asked Trey. """"Because Mrs. (Last Name) does it for -everyone- and is so attractive."""" Her son rolled his eyes and was so uncomfortable, and asked Trey another question about why he was so into girls from private school. """"We figured this was just because he went to public school. The allure of short skirts had worn off for us a long time ago, but he'd never been around it. We didn't know (it indicated pedophilia in Trey's case). If only we had known, we could have helped Ginger."""" This was kind of a subplot in the book, but at the same time a big part of it. I think it was a suspense novel or mystery. I don't remember why it wasn't narrated by Ginger's dad. The book was hardback with a white spine but colors on the cover. The author was a man with initials M or D? When the other guys from the friend group all grew up, only Ginger's dad was married and had a kid. The narrator may have gone through a breakup? This took place in the USA.

One night, her cousin's (brother's?) friend was also visiting. He cornered her in a room with a billiard table (or other gaming table) and sexually assaulted her. She was young enough not to quite know how to talk about it. (13? 14?) When she did tell her parents, they did not want to implicate her cousin or uncle, or tear the family apart.

All I really remember about this one is that it's set in England, and near the beginning, the main characters are watching a production (or maybe a rehearsal) of the ancient Greek play Antigone , at a girl's boarding school. The teen girl in the title role (who may be the murder victim later, though I don't recall for sure) is doing a great job with it; but at one point when she pauses in delivering a speech, the prompter says the next line loudly enough to ruin the effect, and take the heart out of the rest of the performance. (Agatha Christie may be the author, and this may be a Poirot book, but I wouldn't swear to either.) I know this probably isn't much to go on; but I'd love to track this book down! :-)

I was curious about the circumstances of author Robert Tewdwr Moss's death in London after he spent a night out on the day he finished writing the book. Apparently, the author's murderers have been out on parole for some time: https://www.northwichguardian.co.uk/n... I wondered if the murderers had any connection to Moss's lovers in Syria. It doesn't seem so, but it sounds like he had some sort of sexual relationship with at least one of the two London-based murderers. Because they destroyed the laptop which held the just-completed book, I wonder if they had been concerned about its contents, too. The gay writer Edmund White offered his thoughts in the case back in 2003: https://www.evernote.com/shard/s95/sh... Do any of the folks in this forum have thoughts or ideas around the author's death?

The day he finished writing a book about his adventures, he went out with friends to celebrate in London. The next day, he had been murdered and the laptop that contained the book was destroyed. His friends and editors had reviewed earlier versions of the book and were able to finish and publish it posthumously. I'm curious about the book and the author. Also, when I read the book, the author's murder had not been solved. I'm curious if the murder has been solved yet.

The book took you on an 'interview' journey with yourself after you had your dream... ('what does an empty room mean to you?' - some people would feel exposed in an empty room, others would relish the space... and so, the interpretation would be different for different people).

goodreads	22201382	1	Emily Wood	2022-08-05T00:00:00Z	I read this in about 2018, but sure it was quite a bit older. I think it was by someone who usually writes for adults (had in my head it was Jane Gardam, but have looked at all her books). It's about a family, several children, possibly a cousin or two, on a farm in (possibly Yorkshire) England. It's in the future where some crisis ( I can't remember if this is explained) means they have gone back to a simple agricultural way of life, with only the roads / motorways as a reminder of how life used to be. I think they find enough fuel to use a last remaining car towards the end of the book. I really enjoyed it, and thought I would remember who it was by and find it again. But clearly I can't.				
goodreads	22201382	2	Angela	2022-08-05T00:00:00Z	Out There by Elisabeth Mace , maybe? It was also published under the title Ransome Revisited .				
goodreads	22201382	3	Emily Wood	2022-08-05T00:00:00Z	Oddly similar, but no, it's not that. It was a much gentler book, I think. I don't really remember very much actually happening. The children had some gentle rural adventures, exploring the local area and generally setting the scene. Quite near the end there's a bit more drama - possibly someone is injured and they have to try to get to ? London quickly, and manage to find enough fuel to take a car that's been mouldering in a barn, with an adult who drives them. Possibly an aunt who arrives?				
goodreads	22201382	4	Jennifer Heise	2022-08-05T00:00:00Z	Sounds a bit like one of the Changes Trilogy by Peter Dickinson, such as the Weathermonger, but those aren't particularly gentle. Something by Joan Aiken, perhaps?				
goodreads	22201382	5	Emily Wood	2022-08-05T00:00:00Z	No, not the Weathermonger, I've read that. Yes, it's a similar lifestyle, but it doesn't have the same post-apocalyptic feel at all. If it weren't for the roads, for most of the book, it could have just been set in the early 20th century.				
goodreads	22201382	6	Rainbowheart	2022-08-05T00:00:00Z	"The Prince in Waiting is similar to The Weathermonger , but I think those both might be too """"sci-fi"""" to be what you're looking for.

goodreads	22201382	7	Emily Wood	2022-08-05T00:00:00Z	No, it doesn't sound like any of those. There was no magic or fantasy. I think the children were around the 10-14 sort of age, maybe some of them younger. There were a group of four to six children, possibly the children who lived there all the time and some visiting cousins, boys and girls, and I don't feel there was any particular main one.

goodreads	22201382	9	Emily Wood	2022-08-05T00:00:00Z	no, but then it wasn't very 'science fiction'. That's why I got quite excited about the first recommendation, Out There, both the Cumbrian setting and the Arthur Ransome link seemed very plausible, because it was like an old-fashioned children's adventure story. And I mustn't forget about the author, because the reason I thought I'd find it again is that it was by a well-known author who usually writes for adults.

goodreads	22201382	11	Emily Wood	2022-08-05T00:00:00Z	Good question. I came across it in a pile of books from my children's primary school library, and I did wonder, because of the author. Maybe that's why I thought of Jane Gardam as a possible author, because it's probably one of those books that doesn't really classify easily. It was about children and there was nothing in it that would have been unsuitable for children, and because of where I found it, I assumed it was. But it wasn't a rollicking adventure (why I can't remember what really happened in it), it was more about the atmosphere and the descriptions, so maybe it it was aimed at adults.

goodreads	22201382	14	Andy Phillips	2022-08-05T00:00:00Z	Is it definitely in the UK? It sounds like it if you remember specific places like possibly Yorkshire and London (even if those places aren't quite right). Presumably this story isn't too long after the crisis/disaster if the car is still running. Can people remember what things were like before the disaster? Or is it turning into myths?				
goodreads	22201382	15	Emily Wood	2022-08-05T00:00:00Z	A few questions to answer! It could be the same book Sven is looking for, from what they've said about it - so will have to follow that thread too! Not Mara and Dann, or any of the books suggested to Sven. It isn't at all futuristic. Initially I thought it was set in the first half of the 20th century from the way they lived - a basically unmechanised British rural life. It was only gradually as they talked about the roads and things that it gradually became clear that they had more industrial processes but had had to leave them behind. As Andy says, it can't have been too long ago, so the adults must have remembered the time before, but I can't remember if it ever really explained what happened or if it is just implied that there was some kind of crisis. And yes, I'm quite sure it was based in the UK.				
goodreads	22201382	16	Emily Wood	2022-08-05T00:00:00Z	Meant to say as well, after reading Sven's post, it could quite easily have been written in the 80s.

goodreads	22201382	24	Emily Wood	2023-08-05T00:00:00Z	No, not Survivors. Whatever the apocaplypse was, it's not a big deal to the story. It's only a way in that you even realise that it happened. As I said earlier, when I started reading it, I thought it was just country life in the first half of the 20th century, and it was only gradually that odd things like the existence of the empty motorways come in. Also, I am certain that it is written by a fairly well-known female author of books for adults, because I was surprised to see she'd written it, and I was sure I would remember who it was so I could find it again! But clearly not.

goodreads	22204230	1	Nadine Keels	2022-08-05T00:00:00Z	"Hello! I'm looking for a young adult romance I read back in the early or mid-1990s. The setting is completely or mostly at the beach, and much of the story is told through the hero and heroine's conversations with short lines of dialogue going back and forth, back and forth, for pages at a time. (I think the book was part of a series or brand of quick YA reads that were mostly written through conversations, with the series or brand tagline or logo on the front cover.) I don't remember what range of years the story takes place in, though I remember having the impression that it must have been a somewhat older book because the heroine envies a different girl who's got a smaller chest than the heroine does. It seemed that minimal feminine curves being viewed as """"the ideal"""" was an older or out-of-date trend/idea at the time I read the book. Maybe? Either way, I think the heroine was worried that the guy she liked at the beach would prefer someone more like the smaller-chested (possibly flirtier?) girl. The illustration that covers the whole front cover shows the hero and heroine lounging on blankets at the beach, maybe each sitting up on one of their elbows, facing and smiling at each other. Her bathing suit might be dark all over or black and white. And the book may have included grayscale penciled illustrations inside, as I seem to remember a picture where the smaller-chested girl is shown from the back, running or playing down the beach in the background with another person or two, with her hair or ponytail flying behind her. Any ideas about the title or author, or possibly the name of an older chat-focused YA series featuring pages of short lines of dialogue? Thanks!"

For some reason I really want to say one of the girl's names was Nora, but I can't be certain.

It was most likely published in the USA and was in English Spoilers abound below... It was about a small group of humans who were captured by an advanced race that put them in a simulation. The simulation looked good - but all the machines in it were non-functional. The group trekked through the simulation for some time. The advanced race was from the past, and they were time-travelling into their future several tens or hundreds of thousands of years at a time - and they were looking for a newly developed civilization or intelligence that could solve a problem that had developed with their genetic code. The advanced race was also utterly amoral in every possible sense and were fully intending to wipe out every civilization they found which was not advanced enough to solve their problem. There was at least a man & a woman in the party - I think there may have been 2 or 3 others. The woman may have been the daughter of a planetary leader - whose country was wiped out by the callous placement of a beacon in their territory from a galactic federation.

goodreads	22226034	12	Jo To	2022-08-05T00:00:00Z	thank you.

goodreads	22229086	1	Paige	2022-08-05T00:00:00Z	I read this book when I was in elementary school. To be safe, somewhere between 1997-2002. The main characters were children. It was set during winter. There was an old lady that was a witch. She would paint portraits of people and include a personal item of theirs that she had in her possession. She would then show it to them to trap them into it somehow? The details here are a little fuzzy. The group of children break into her house at some point and see all of the portraits. Possible Spoiler Ahead One of the children who broke into her house and saw all of the portraits drops a mitten. The witch uses the mitten to trap that child into a portrait.

It's a glove, not a mitten, at the end, that she realises she's lost, but otherwise it's as you remember: I pulled it out. It was a glove. One fuzzy pink glove. I stuck my hand back into the pocket and groped around, but aside from an old crumpled gum wrapper, the pocket was empty. I yanked the parka out of the closet and searched to see if there was a hole in the pocket â perhaps the glove had fallen into the lining of the coat. But there was none.A numbing horror overtook me as I explored the closet floor and hunted through boots, sneakers, and shoe polish. I didnât find my missing glove....Next Mrs. Blackert, adorned in her flowing black cape and a wide black hat, emerged. For a moment she stood in the snow and regarded her vacant house. Then she moved her hand â the one closest to me â to the pocket of her cape. She tilted her head my way and smiled as only a witch can smile.And as she moved toward her house with a ghostly fluidity, I was certain that I saw, between her black gloved fingers, something peeking out.

Another was about a new kid to school that everyone thought was strange and it turned out he was an alien that would go """"home"""" to a UFO. (Discovered when kids followed him one night) The story I remember the most was about a police officer in a desert town saw huge ships """"float"""" towards the town as he was in the desert, he heard a loud hum and saw beam of light from the ship and when he got back in town everyone and everything was gone and in their place were prehistoric humanoids . The story ended with a future scientist being puzzled uncovering a gun from the site of where the town was in what was assumed to be far in the future after humanity was reset. The cover of the book had a picture of the Earth in the middle with a target over it like it was in the scope of a gun.

I most likely got it from a Scholastic flyer or book fair at the time. I recall it being very thin, like a chapter book, and possibly black in color. I mostly recall one story where the character was, as described from their perspective â V. African Americanâ (v being for vampire). The story ended with the main character drinking a school bullyâs blood. The title of this story may have been âdoing it old schoolâ or something similar. The only other thing I can recall is a fragment of another story where the main character recalls how a fellow vampire had chipped their fang on a Blackberry. (As in the phone, though child me didnât get that and thought said vampire was just really bad at being a vampire.) If nothing else, this places the time period for this book pretty firmly in the 2000âs to early 2010âs. I donât know if the anthology was exclusively vampires, or if only one half was vampires and the other something else, or if there were just a lot of vampires in general? I think the title of the book- or at least one half of it- may have had âbiteâ in it, perhaps in some sort of spooky pun, but I donât know for sure and honestly, this really wouldnât narrow down much in a search for any horror, stories, let alone vampire stories specifically.

Unfortunately I can't find a Google Books preview or copy on archive.org to browse, but the description and the similarity of the title to what you remember makes me hopeful! The new girl at school calls herself a âtravellerâ and says she comes from beyond the stars. Ben doesnât believe her, of course, but then again Zillah isnât quite like anyone he and his friends have ever met. Thereâs her name for a start, and she doesnât even know how to play their games.

If i remember correctly the foreword or first story detailed a car crash in the mountains somewhere. The unique thing about the book was all the stories were written in 2nd person (you are driving etc..) I think the book was published in late 1990s or early 2000s.. I got it at Barnes and Noble in c. 2005..

goodreads	22260694	1	SD	2022-08-05T00:00:00Z	I would say I read this book around 5-6 years ago and it starts with a murder of a girl and then cuts to the main character who is going on a weekend/vacation trip with her best friend to the best friend's family cabin in the woods. They go to a gas station to pick up snacks and run into the best friend's brother who the main character had dated and broken up with, she feels really awkward but then a handsome stranger in the gas station pretends to be her boyfriend so she won't feel weird around her ex. The stranger says her name so she is very confused and then he points out her name is either on her license plate or somewhere on her car (I can't quite remember) The main character and best friend then go to the cabin and then eventually the best friend's brother (main character's ex) shows up. The main character eventually learns that the brother/her ex is the serial killer that killed the girl in the beginning scene and tries to shoot him but he makes a comment about how many people do not realize how easy it is to miss shooting someone with a gun even if they are close. The stranger from the gas station ends up coming to the cabin and saves her and it is revealed that the girl murdered at the beginning is the stranger's sister. The stranger and the main character end up together and there is a large emphasis on this necklace that the stranger's sister had.				
goodreads	22260694	2	SD	2022-08-05T00:00:00Z	Another update that might be helpful is that the book wasn't a full psychological thriller/horror book, there was also the romance aspect with the stranger as well which toned it down a lot more

goodreads	22260694	9	SD	2025-01-05T00:00:00Z	Hi Kris, I would say it was a mix of both romance and mystery as it started off more lighthearted and then slowly shifted in tone throughout the book. I canât remember 100% but I believe they had just graduated college or were on break while in college. It was definitely located in the US maybe California or a region with a fair amount of forested area. I think the couple broke up because the female main character didnât think they were right for each other but it seemed like the ex was still after her and there was no bad blood between her and her best friend

Haven't got any luck with this :/ Iâm looking for a book where the Hero is grumpy and he is taking the guardianship of his little sister.... at first just until one of his brother returns. He treats the little girl with distance but the heroine makes him realize that he is doing what his father did with him. The little girl is cute and only wants to be with the Hero. There was a scene where he figured out what he was doing... the little girl tried to do many things with him but he rejected her and he was like be quiet and go to sleep on your own or we wonÂ´t do running anymore (things like that, I think it was running in the mornings but I'm not sure ) and one time he entered her room and she was in the center awake but making no sound.

Hannah is blonde and blue eyed. During a Passover Seder she time-slips into Poland, circa 1942. All kinds of spoilers here, so: (view spoiler) [she's at a wedding for the whole village, and when they go to the temple, they're rounded up by German soliders and dispatched to a concentration camp (based on Auschwitz) in a train. A bunch of kids, a baby, and some elderly don't survive the train trip. They are then moved on again, separated by gender. Young kids are sent directly to the gas chamber, so they are told by existing prisoners (been there for years - running the place on a small scale, reporting to soliders) to lie about their ages. Very small children learn to run and hide in the dump when inspections are done. Hannah's alternate ego, Chaya, does not survive the camp (virtually none of the characters do - lots of deaths), but Hannah who mysteriously timeslipped into it, does, and realises the girl who's life she saved by sacrificing herself to the gas chamber (as Chaya) in the 40s is her dull old great aunt. The sondercommando who carried out the cremations, also a Jewish prisoner, was her mentally broken uncle. She knew the numbers of their arm tattoos...

He takes her back to his village. She enters in a relationship with the man she saved, and is later encouraged to be in a polyamorous relationship with another man who lost his partner years ago and is a single father. There is a ritual where she has to offer him food (a piece of fruit) to join her bed/household. Towards the end of the series, she becomes pregnant but faces a threat from a stronger race which kidnaps some of the villagers, including her lovers. When she first enters the village, there is a scene of a woman trying to give birth in a hut. She is dying and losing a lot of blood. The âshamanâ of the village reassures everyone that the woman will be fine. The female main character uses her knowledge of modern medicine to help save the girl and has the shaman banished from the village for lying. Another scene I remember is when she suggests that the villagers build a fence for their livestock and domesticate them in order for them to be protected, live longer, have offspring, and use them for food and clothing. I believe that this portal appeared during a storm. I also believe that the characters have a mental connection (are able to communicate mentally or feel each otherâs emotions) I read this book between the years of 2010-2015	unusable			not an actual book, but a short story published online / link to website with sexual content

goodreads	22320492	5	Tatiana Alejo	2023-06-27T00:00:00Z	I donât believe she was a nurse, only aware of modern birth techniques. Before falling into the portal, I think she might have been a researcher. When sent out to investigate in a field or mountain, an unexpected storm arrives. Then, she somehow falls or goes through this portal. There were no other supernatural topics. However, the stronger race that kidnapped the natives might of had supernatural abilities that made it easy to control them. The main female character did not seem to be affected by their abilities though. It was probably related to the fact that she was not from their world. I remember another scene where she encounters a man from her world. They both came through this storm portal but he tells her itâs impossible to go back. Also, when she was pregnant, a man visiting from another village tried to kill her because her features are similar to a person from the stronger race. I donât remember if it was a standalone book or a series.

I'm not posting and spoilers as far as I know because I didn't get that far into the book. I don't remember any names, sorry!! I believe the book takes place in the 2019, but it's definitely 2015+ The book reads from 3 perspectives: Mistress (only at the beginning of the book), Husband, and Wife. The book starts from the perspective of the mistress. She has sex with a married man and they get into an argument about him not leaving his wife. The man leaves so she takes a shower, she hears someone come in and thinks it's the man, but it's someone else that ends up murdering her. She's supposed to go on a business trip (I think it was later that same day) and the driver she booked to take her to the airport has an uneasy feeling about her not answering her phone so he goes into her apartment and finds her dead. Side note: The mistress is a young adult and she has a cat. I think the driver described the cat having blood on it while he was waiting for her. I believe she also lived in Portland. Man gets home and police show up on his door to take him to the station for questioning about the murder of his mistress. His affair is uncovered. When the wife finds out, she doesn't believe her husband committed the crime. The wife and husband have twin boys together and they work for the father of the wife. It's a large company and the wife comes from wealth. The husband was using company funds disguised as work meetings to travel from Texas to see his mistress. Wife's parents show up at the house with their family lawyer for damage control. The wife's parents have never been a fan of the husband in general. The book goes into details about the husband having met his mistress at a coffee shop while he was on a real business trip. I don't remember much else about the description of their affair aside from the mistress being irresponsible with money. The husband found her unpaid bills and he wanted to help her with them, but she got mad when he tried to bring it up. I think she was getting by with a sugar daddy kind of situation before having met the husband? The wife decided to take yoga classes and ends up falling for the yoga instructor. They hit it off and they want to sleep together, but they decide to wait until she serves her husband divorce papers. She had them drawn up and ready to go, but all hell broke loose with the murder so she decided that wasn't the right time. The yoga instructor owns a small bar in town and after the husband's affair had been uncovered, he drove to the bar and found his wife playing darts with the instructor and caused a pretty big scene. The last things I remember: The wife travels to the apartment where the murder took place and breaks into the property where a police officer that's investigating in her hometown catches her and tells her to gtfo. While she was in the apartment, she discovers her husband had gifted the mistress a necklace that he had gifted her for the birth of their twins. After she gets kicked out of the apartment, she decides to talk to the next door neighbor. The neighbor is an older lady that gave the wife some information on the kind of person the mistress was. As she was leaving, she gets a phone call or a text from the actual killer telling her to leave it alone and confirming her husband isn't the actual killer. The husband gets drunk and drives their SUV to the bar and he ends up getting arrested again cuz he's a reckless idiot. It was implied that he had the murder weapon in his center console."	unsolved

It was a long time before she was found by searchers, of course she had died long before. I can't for the life of me, remember the name of the book, or the names of people in it.

It was recommended on one of those online lists for """"best books on writing"""" at the time, so I assume it was a popular one in that category, but when I tried searching for the typical recommendations now I can't seem to find the same one I read. (It's not Bird by Bird, or Save the Cat, etc.) I only got through the first couple of chapters, and all I can remember is that the main point was about """"begin your story in the middle of action to get the reader's attention"""". It might have even been the name of the first chapter. I think the entire book might be focused on the structure and plot (instead of prose and style), though I could be wrong.

I've included some links to lists of this type that I've come across below. Sifting through them all would probably be a serious time commitment on your part, especially considering that the books are ranked based on how many people have voted for them, so the lists are constantly being refreshed as more Goodreads users vote or add books. But your book description was a bit too vague for me to narrow down a specific title, and I thought that browsing through some of these lists yourself might help spark something more in your memory.

They lower a cage, and the stranded get in the cage one at a time and the cage is winched up. At one point, the pilot has got the joystick pulled all the way back to try to gain altitude and not be swamped, yet the altimeter keeps reading the same low altitude -- because the huge wave is rising at the same speed as the helicopter! They have raised a cage with one man in it. They are trying to swing the cage into the helicopter yet for some reason it doesn't swing in. Then they see the reason: another desperate man is clinging to the bottom of the cage, on the outside.

It was a light neutral color with something simple in the center of the cover (i can't remember if it was an image or just the title or what). The story was set in what I believe was Italy or some other similar European country. The book follows that life of a girl as she grows up and struggles with life. It starts with her as a child at a ski resort. She is alone on a ski lift and falls off and gets buried in a pile of snow. I think she might break her leg or something. She eventually gets found but I don't remember much else of the child section. I think thins is where we meet another recurring character, a young troubled boy who crosses her path throughout the book. It cuts to different points of her in life; her as a preteen/teenager, a young adult, etc. The section of her as a teenager she has developed an eating disorder (anorexia I think) and doesn't have a lot of friends. I think there is a birthday party involved in the teen chapters? When the book ends I think she is in her mid to late 20s. Throughout the different points of her life the boy she met as a kid keeps crossing her path and is dealing with struggles of his own. They keep getting close to each other and then ending up on different paths and falling out of each others lives. I think at the end of the boot he is a physicist or professor or something. I have spent the last couple hours trying to find this book and I'm hitting a wall. Any help on my quest is much appreciated!

The boy may have been a family friend or something but I think it was just a random boy at the ski resort. They ended up being from the same city and would cross paths thought out growing up. They never got in a relationship but there was a kind of will-they-won't-they / star-crossed lovers kinda vibe. Like the feeling that they are almost a good match but they are off just enough that they don't quite fit. I don't remember her job as an adult.

goodreads	22415297	1	K	2023-06-27T00:00:00Z	I purchased this book in hardcover sometime between 1998-2004, although I suspect more like between 2000-2003. It has a pretty distinctive blue cover and I actually have a photo of the spine in a stack of books in an old digital photo of my room at the time â I canât sharpen it enough to read the author/title, but you can see the color/design of the spine clearly and again I feel itâs pretty distinctive with beige/sage green stripes near the bottom end of the spine. Title appears to be written in script. If thereâs a way to post the photo please let me know. Itâs about a group of adult female friends trying to find their way in an urban setting in their 20s/30s. Romantic misadventures, career unfulfillment, etc. Told from alternating perspectives of the friends. I want to say itâs set in NYC or Chicago. Opening scene is very distinctive in my memory â one of the women is rushing home to throw a dinner party for these friends and carrying groceries in a paper bag and she drops them. I want to say she plans to roast a chicken for this party. (I remember such random weird things.) Another one of the friends spends a lot of time languishing in her bed which she is hesitant to leave. She loves her bed and her room (and I think sometimes has a lover come over) and I feel like she talks about loving the âblue lightâ in her room, like maybe during dusk/the lâheure bleu or something like that. (But it has nothing to do with Paris.) Thereâs some theme of blue throughout (at least with this one character) and I think thatâs why the cover is blue. Definitely a female author. General fiction, not super literary but more literary than chick lit.	unusable			references an image

goodreads	22416818	1	Kayla	2023-06-27T00:00:00Z	Spoilers ahead!! I read this book back in the late 2010s era so 2015-2019. It was a modern setting. The plot was, to my best recollection, that a woman washes up ashore a beach with amnesia (kind of). She escaped a serial killer who was kidnapping and killing woman and she couldnât remember who it was. She works with a detective and they contact her adopted brother and he provides DNA etc. they return to the island and I feel like a half built or in-construction building was there that the big confrontation takes place at. They find a brick wall with a very old young dead body. And it turns out the brother had been killing girls the same age as her as she grew up. Possibly he killed their mom? Not 100% on that. I canât find it anywhere! Help is greatly appreciated!! Thank you!

And I remember this moment where the detective is trying to ID her and the brother shows up to say either that he doesnât have anything with her DNA or he might bring a brushâ¦but he basically says it wouldnât matter because mom and dad are dead and she was adopted so her DNA wonât match his. I remember the beginning - her washing up on a beach. I remember that it was significant that she escaped the serial killer. I remember that DNA wouldnât help identify her. That the brother is involved and trying to be âhelpfulâ. I remember the âislandâ with the partially constructed building (hotel?) where the confrontation happens with her and brother. The detective finding the wall with the body inside and realizing brother was killing girls same age as his sister while they were growing up.

Out of necessity goes for a visit and then is """"stuck"""" there just at the start of WWII, when travel was restricted owing to gas rationing in both countries. She works at restoring the villa, with the help of less than reliable villagers, and somehow had diplomatic visitors (from both countries?) In one anecdote, she rents out an outbuilding (the first B&B) because she is short on funds, food, utilities, and has repeated issues with both governments for permits. She somehow got a telephone. One of the visitors was an American author (Tennessee Williams or Wm. Faulkner, or Truman Capote) and the book included descriptions of his childhood (running away from an abusive father at 8 years old, sleeping in ditches), his rise to fame and fortune (he bought an antebellum colonial mansion with major repair issues) traveled via an expensive automobile (Bugatti convertible big and old) and brought along excess baggage, numerous diverse pets--I think one was a duck, today known as emotional support animals. He drank. he caraused, engaged in sex with women and men. But they managed to have these incredible conversations that gave me cause to hold the author in high esteem. She had major problems rousing him from his apartment, he was very childlike and always got into trouble with the authorities, it was ???!!! that he could find women to take back to his apartment. I think the story is true. I read this book around 1995-2000. It is anecdotes of the many problems she had with visitors and repair. There was a depressed wife of a diplomat... I am aware of similar books/films that are NOT this book, such as Under the Tuscan Sun: UTS involves a couple, and it has different """"geography"""" of the villa landscape (I think there was a swimming pool and mushroom hunters along with animal hunters in UTS; the unsolved title was on a steep hillside. It is complicated by possibly both of these books may have been made into films. Another similar book involved a woman and focused on her bitter relationship with a worthless man; though the meals were big, the story was about their dysfunctional relationship. Ah, and of course The Durrells TV series, in which a divorced woman brings along her 3 children. It's none of those. Thanks."	unsolved

goodreads	22425737	1	RabbitMilitia	2023-08-05T00:00:00Z	"I think this one is going to be a little difficult to solve as I have very little memory of anything substantial. I am positive I read it in 1987. It was a paperback novel centered on the Vietnam War from the perspective of a United States military man (I think a Marine, but possibly a soldier). The book was likely written to capitalize on the popularity of films like Platoon and Full Metal Jacket. The main character might have been named Johnny or Jonny (though this might just be stuck in my mind as the """"generic young soldier"""" name). The story arc might have involved him sort of losing innocence, coming of age, etc. though I am not at all clear on that. The only item I remember distinctly is that there was a character named Stryker or Striker (not sure of spelling, but I think of this book every time I see anything about the Marvel villain with that name) who was portrayed to have questionable morality- maybe not quite an antagonist, but possibly a kind of bad actor or at least very aggressive. I am pretty sure the cover of the book showed the main character- possibly walking in a heavily forested area with a gun in his hands (I think?). When I try to picture it, he may have had a helmet on and may have had light brown/dark blond hair- realistic looking drawing. The novel itself was likely about 150- 200 or so pages long I think.

I am completely positive I read the book in 1987 (there are specific life circumstances that were going on during that year that make me know that much at least :) ). It was definitely a single story focusing mainly on one soldier and he was definitely not African American. I really do suspect this may have been just a kind of quickly written and published story to capitalize on the popularity of the Vietnam War genre of film around that time.

For some reason, his name sticks in my head (I've noticed that I often used to gravitate towards or remember characters other than main characters in books).

I think the mom was sick and this vacation was supposed to be a treat for them. The ex gets arrested in the airport for having drugs I think so he misses the first week of the vacation. The brother also invites his prim and proper ex-fling/gf to the vacation but she leaves early. The FMC and MMC end up spending a lot of time together competing and jogging early in the morning. The MMC eventually goes to ??the Congo?? for DWB and that causes problems with their relationship especially since she tries to visit him and he gets scared and sends her back home. FMC manager was also stealing money from her. I read the book this year. I think itâs relatively new, like published within the last 5 years or so but Iâm not positive.

My Independent Study adviser suggested it to me at the College of Wooster in 2013 as a reference text while I was working on a project exploring a collage/pastiche style of writing and media. I remember so little about the content and style. Here's what I do remember: -It definitely had a long, rhythmic title (I keep thinking """"All Quiet On the Western Front"""" but that's not it, just a similar rhythmic flow). -Definitely a male American author, definitely 21st century, and I'm fairly sure he was white. -I feel pretty certain that it contained both photography and writing. -Possibly about men and their working conditions in Appalachia or just working class American men in general. -It may have been considered literary journalism or it may have been more creative writing. -I remember discussing it with my adviser while also discussing Walter Benjamin's """"Arcades"""" project, in case that gives a better idea of the kind of theoretical lens we were using.

I donât remember lots of plot points but I do have a section of a passage from a picture I took once on my kindle. â Where I could belong, where I could maybe one day be free. I was safe here - in this country, in this commune, in Davidâs arms - and I never ever wanted to leave. We stayed there for a long time, watching the sun crest the hill with all its yellow and pink glory. I remember thinking that Iâd never been truly happy before, not like this. I had only ever been trying to survive. I made up my mind then and there that Iâd never let the feeling go, that Iâd never let anyone take these gilded memories from me. Then the moment was over, and we had to rush to get dressed and run back to the house. We hid the blanket in an unused suitcase in the garage, and I made it back in time to wash my face and hands, fix my hair and get my glasses on, and plop down in the living room. â

She runs into a group of guys, who I believe are musicians, and somewhat become friends. I don't remember if they all knew each other beforehand or never met, but they become friends and attractions form. Since this is a series, I don't know if it's a reverse harem situation or if the girl will pick one guy in the end. What I do know is, one of the male callers that calls the hotline every week becomes obsessed with the main female character and ends up kidnapping her while simultaneously putting the guys in difficult situations (drugging the ones with previous habits then inviting women to their hotel room while calling paparazzi or something). This is where the first book ended. I want to say I read this book on 2021? At the time, the second book hadn't been announced and I've since lost the title of the first book and can't follow-up.

A human astronaut crash lands on an alien planet and discovers an automated city designed as an oasis for space farers. Unfortunately the aliens that designed it were so different from humans that the facilities are useless to him: the temperatures are hellishly hot, the food is inedible, and the music is just an awful noise. The cities tries to adapt itself to his physiology, but begins to break down with the effort. Just as the astronaut has resigned himself to death, he wakes up to find the city seemingly transformed: the food is heavenly, the music divine, and the accommodations luxurious. He's so happy that he hardly realizes he now has a trunk and a tail (the city turned him into an alien).	unusable			short story published in a book

Finally takes a pregnancy test, finds out sheâs pregnant, only to be attacked in her own home. I think itâs a rival pack that attacks her bc the guy she hooks up with is important in his pack. Her baby daddy rescues her in time and whisks her away to his pack, where she learns about shifters I donât remember much more than this. I read it around 2015-2017.

A woman (maybe a support worker) was interacting with him and noticed he was using eye movements (maybe blinking) to try to communicate. She continued to experiment with communicating with him and eventually he was enabled trhough technology to be able to communicate.

goodreads	22518275	1	KK	2023-08-05T00:00:00Z	I got this guide around 2007, but from what I remember about the quality of the photographs, it might've been published much earlier, like around the 80s/90s. It was soft cover and the size of a regular paperback, but it was thick, and the cover and interior pages were glossy as you'd expect from, say, a bird field guide. The cover art was a picture of several yellow-colored puppies, probably labs. The header (which included the title in white text) and footer of the cover was a dark red color. It looked very similar to Dog Language: An Encyclopedia of Canine Behavior , but the puppies were from a photograph, not illustration. The guide itself was very thick and comprehensive. It was separated into continent of origin, (like Europe, Asia, America, etc.) and type of dog (hound, toy, terrier, etc.) It had a small picture of every breed, and included basic stats and history of the breeds. Again, it was very comprehensive and included a lot of uncommon breeds I'd never heard of. Of course since I lost the guide, I don't remember what the breeds are, haha. EDIT: all of the photographs inside were colored.

goodreads	22522631	1	Rosa M	2023-08-05T00:00:00Z	A couple years ago, like 2019, I read a book that was I think riffing off of the concept that we're all six degrees of separation from each other, the most obvious example being celebrities. (My grandpa met Elvis, Elvis met Richard Nixon, so I'm two degrees from Richard Nixon. Anyways you get the idea.) So this book looked at those specific interactions, and the person being 'met' in the first story would be the person 'meeting' in the next. Liz Taylor met James dean, in the next story James dean met someone else. Each chapter/story is just a recounting of that interaction according to eyewitnesses and the people themselves, so I don't think it's considered fiction. I remember the book started and ended with people interacting with Hitler, and that the cover was red with several white circles on the front in kind of a loop. I can't for the life of me remember the title or author.

So this whole time the story is in the disabled boys head but then switches to the other boy's perspective to reveal what really happened. Cannot remember anything before the plot twist ending! It was really depressing. I think the author was Australian. It is not a big name author. I think the character's name was Finn,not sure which one.

Its a 'nice', humerous book. Yes, he has a single friend who has a place free to rent. The fun is him hanging about with 20something men who have very different values/at different stages of their life. He nearly gets caught in a park where his wife is pushing a pram.

goodreads	22561357	1	Lily	2023-08-05T00:00:00Z	I read a book a long time ago. It takes place in either Scotland or Ireland. A man goes to the city, somehow finds a woman to marry, takes her back to his (peat?) farm which is possibly on an island, as they had to use a ferry. They live in a stone cottage with his brother. The brother resents the new wife but eventually it becomes love. The husband dies in an accident and the brother is tormented. This is not a fluffy book by a prolific author, it is very detailed with lovely descriptions of the land and her daily life on the farm, getting to know the cottage, her husband and the brother. I believe it takes place in the early 1900s, as they are burning peat for fuel, and I think there is a picture of a stone cottage on the cover. I've tried searching online using all kinds of plot descriptions and tags and cannot find the name. Can anyone help?				
goodreads	22561357	2	Kris	2023-08-05T00:00:00Z	Lily, can we eliminate December Bride by Sam Hanna Bell ? How did the farmer find his wife? Is she attracted to the resentful brother? Around what year did you read this book? A range of years is fine.				
goodreads	22561357	3	Lily	2023-08-05T00:00:00Z	It is not December Bride. The female main character was residing in a larger town/city on the mainland. I'm not sure how the farmer finds her. It may have been word of mouth, or by chance. I think she may have lived in a boarding house. She may have been a house maid/servant. At first I believe she is just confounded as to why the brother seems to dislike her so. But yes her attraction grew and I think once he finally confessed his love, she realized she loved him, too. I can't remember if they had sex or not while the brother is still alive. But they were def in love and this is why the brother is so tormented after the husband dies, and the relationship is doomed. I think I found this book in the library stacks in approx 2010. It was an older book. I am going to ask the librarian next time I go in. Thanks for your interest, Kris.

What I liked about it was that its chapters were based on style: how to create an Arts & Crafts room, or an Edwardian Room, or a Hollywood Regency room, etc. etc. It's not a manual on design in general, it's really sort of a style guide on what elements combine to make a room feel of that period.

goodreads	22568084	1	Laura	2023-08-05T00:00:00Z	I probably read this book between 2000 and 2006. I believe it was a chapter book with some pictures. Protagonist was an African girl of age 10 or so, in a part of Africa I can't remember, and I want to say the setting was way back in historyâmaybe the year 1300? I read only the beginning, so I don't remember much about the plot or even why she left her home. I just remember descriptions of artwork in the village and a conversation with an elderly artisan. Once out of the village, the girl gets sick and uses leaves to reduce her fever (or maybe wakes up to find herself cared for by a stranger who uses leaves to reduce the fever?). The book seemed new and was published in English and, I'm guessing, the U.S., where I live. I found it on my family's bookshelf in Florida (it's no longer there). I was familiar with the American Girl books, so at first I thought it might be Saba: Under the Hyena's Foot , which was part of the American Girl brand's Girls of Many Lands series, but I don't think it is. I'm associating the book with the color green and the letter G. I remember the writing being vivid and would love to revisit this book, so any ideas are much appreciated!

goodreads	22591837	1	Eli Hutchinson	2024-08-05T00:00:00Z	"Sometime in the late 2000s/early 2010s, I visited my local library in the metro-Atlanta area and stumbled upon a hardback coffee table book with a vibrant color scheme (yellow, I think) and a cover featuring a comic book style illustration of a prohibition-era gangster or two. The comic book art style was reminiscent of the original Superman and Batman comics in the 1930s with somewhat faded primary colors and angular looking people. I was intrigued and so opened it to find that the book was a compendium about how the mob and gangsters, both real and imagined, were depicted in comics in the early 20th century, often emphasizing how the comics glamorized and sensationalized the gangster lifestyle. I can't recall the year, but the glossy finish on the dust cover suggests that that printing of the book at least was fairly recent. The text was mostly straightforward and factual, reporting what happened in the realm of gangster comics over the years with some commentary from the author examining related trends and how real life events affected the creation and reception of gangster comics (apparently the Valentine's Day Massacre hurt the popularity of these types of comics at the time). Each page had a few images depicting comic panels, covers, or occasionally photos of real people that were interspersed amidst the text; the text generally took up most of the page. Fedoras, trench coats, Tommy guns, etc. were ubiquitous in these images. The image layout seemed to vary with each page (so images did not always occupy the same spot from page to page). Some things I remember being discussed in the book include comics depicting the careers of real life gangsters like Al """"Scarface"""" Capone, Lucky Luciano, Babyface Nelson, etc. There was also talk about how the Comics Code Authority (and maybe the Hayes code?) altered the gangster genre in comics. Crass language (including terms like """"broads"""") was removed, and even the gangster vernacular was toned down (there was an image showing two of the same comic panel side by side, one with the original slang-ridden vernacular dialogue and the other in a more standard English with cleaner language). Mention and use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs as well as gambling, graphic violence, and sensuality were all limited or omitted to comply with the Code. The glamorization of the violent lifestyle and the sometimes shocking imagery used to draw in readers was also discussed; the book seemed intended for adult readers, and as a kid I was a bit disturbed or just confused by some of this. One image in particular that sticks out in my memory as pretty frightening at the time was a comic book cover showing a stern, condescending looking blonde woman's face in the foreground giving a lengthy testimony in a word bubble, saying something like """"Ya wanna know? Fine, I'll tell ya everything...I'll tell ya about the Isle of the Dead!"""" and beneath her in the background was a fedora wearing gangster being attacked by a zombie of some sort amidst a moonlit tropical setting (I think the text mentioned that this strange connection of gangster comics to supernatural horror was related to fears of drug use or """"reefer madness"""" somehow). I was more interested in looking at the comic-book images of gangsters at the time and so didn't think much of the analysis, but now I'd like to go back and re-read it if I can. Unfortunately the library where I found it has since changed locations, and I haven't been able to locate the book at its successor or any of the other connected libraries."

It is a short novel (under three hundred pages) and it would be classified as literary fiction (or should be). The setting, South America, possibly Chile (post-Pinochet) or Peru. The protagonist is a creative, sensitive woman trapped in a loveless marriage to a wealthy business man who is as clueless about the true state of his marriage as he is unimaginative, conventional and dull (a typical fatuous bore). We learn early on in the book that she, the main character, is dying, presumably of cancer. But maybe not. She is an unreliable narrator. We know this because in the first chapter we learn that her lover had just died, """"expired like the ash on the end of his cigarette"""", silently and without notice, right there beside her in a motel bed. She records this in her private journal which she leaves for her estranged husband to find. Since the deceased is her husband's business partner, and very much alive, her clueless clod of a spouse is rather bemused by this fiction. In fact, he knows full well that his partner didn't expire after having sex with his wife because they were on a business trip together that day. In any case, his beautiful, melancholy wife (I am quite taken by her) documents in her journal the progression of her illness and her reflections on love, life, death, loss and relationships and on the inseparability of reality from dreams, fantasy and imagination."

It is a short novel (under three hundred pages) and it would be classified as literary fiction (or should be). It was NOT written by Allende or Ferrante. I am assuming that it wasn't written by a man though. The setting, South America, possibly Chile (post-Pinochet) or Peru. The protagonist is a creative, sensitive woman trapped in a loveless marriage to a wealthy business man who is as clueless about the true state of his marriage as he is unimaginative, conventional and dull (a typical fatuous bore). We learn early on in the book that she, the main character is dying, presumably of cancer, though we never really know this for sure as she might be an unreliable narrator. In fact, we can make this assumption because in the first chapter we learn that her lover had just died, """"expired like the ash on the end of his cigarette"""", silently and without notice, right there in bed beside her as she asks him a question. She dutifully records this incident in her private journal which, later on in the story, she """"accidentally"""" leaves for her estranged husband to find. Since the deceased is her husband's business partner though, and very much alive, her clueless clod of a spouse is rather bemused by this fiction. In fact, he knows full well that his partner didn't expire after making love with his wife because they were on a business trip together on the very day of his alleged death. In any case, his beautiful, melancholy wife (I am quite taken by her) documents in her journal the progression of her illness and her reflections on love, life, death, loss, and relationships, and on the inseparability of reality from dreams, fantasy and imagination. One memorable scene early on in the book (which consists mainly of her journal entries and her husband's own reflections upon reading them) is her meeting with an old Indian woman who walks into her garden, right off the street, while she is out pruning her hedges, and, without so much as a word, she (the old woman) lifts her long skirts and micturates in the flower bed. This singular event she interprets as an omen of her impending death. And it is after this strange occurrence that she begins writing her story. The writing is absolutely exquisite and as limpid as a finely faceted crystal. There is no trace of sentimentality or of pop psychology in this book, let alone any of the overwrought clichÃ©s and over-explaining of mainstream trade fiction. Nothing is explained. Is the journal a work of fiction or is its author really dying? We are never told. The entire book is a sublime meditation on creativity and on life as they weave together the story of a woman's journey towards a future we cannot know. And oh, I so want to finish reading this hidden gem. Not since the depth and economy of Winter' Tales ( Dinessin) have I been this enchanted."

She met a woman on the ship who marries a man who has two daughters and then a son. That man is I believe the brother of the man who married the other woman. The original woman brings a pregnant slave girl with her who watched her master I believe kill the husband of the woman who helped her come over. The slave girls gives birth at the end of the book when her master comes to the plantation and finds her. The second book takes place quite a few years down the road. The two daughters have grown up and are in their coming out season. One wants to be a proper southern belle and the other one does not care and likes being outside. The book starts with their stepmother announcing that she is pregnant and then their is a ball. The daughter who likes to be outside is heartbroken when the older, I think indentured servant, who taught her about being outside and the wilderness dies. I feel like his name was Jim. She falls in love with a red haired indentured servant of her uncles. He eventually gets to go and see if he can find a job when his time as a servant has finished and promises to come back to her. The book ends with her sitting on the porch holding her new sibling, I think a girl, and he comes back for her and she sees him walking up the plantation lawn. The book was a hard cover book that I believe was published by Bethany House Publishers, based on seeing other books that look just like it on the outside. They both had dust jackets, so I am not sure what the actual book looked like. I know one of the books had a plantation house in the background and I believe one or two young ladies on the front cover. I am pretty sure one is wearing a pink dress and the other lady a yellow one. It was set during the times that people could buy slaves. I think that it was before the Civil War.	unusable

goodreads	22618173	9	Meg	2024-06-27T00:00:00Z	I believe the woman and her daughter came to America from England because the man who killed her husband, also the owner of the slave she brought with her, wanted to marry her and she did not. I believe that she was married to her daughterâs father. And I think that she becomes an indentured servant because the man with the 2 daughters and 1 son paid the passage for them to come over. She couldnât pay him back so she became an indentured servant to him. She then I believe either became the indentured servant of the man brother or she marries him.	unusable

goodreads	22620284	1	Caitlin Van	2024-06-27T00:00:00Z	I read this book sometime in between 2012-2016 I believe. I don't remember any of the characters' names specifically but one of them could be August? I don't remember if that's a name, part of the title, or an important month in the story. The general plot is that the characters live kind of back and forth along the American/Canadian border, I think in Minnesota. The story follows their rural lives and I think one character has a farm. One of the characters definitely loves birds. I think he also is autistic or has some sort of mental illness. The most impactful part of the story to me (really the only part I remember vividly) is the end where he sees a murmuration of birds, starlings I think, in autumn. I think I remember a murmuration on the cover, and I'm pretty sure this book was written by a male author.	unsolved			marked as solved, but never clearly confirmed by OP

I remember the protagonist Valerie as a level-headed girl while her friend Andrea is more impulsive and extroverted. They are both nurses. The book cover has an illustration of a pretty woman (wearing a vintage nurse uniform with apron and hat) with shoulder-length hair standing in the daylight. There is no kissing on the book cover...only Valerie in her nurse dress giving a cool stare. (view spoiler) [ Andrea is unmarried but pregnant, probably by Roy. (hide spoiler)]

goodreads	22647913	1	Implement Referee	2024-08-05T00:00:00Z	Okay so this book should be nonfiction based off what i read from it and if its not I'd be surprised. So yes its nonfiction. The books intended audience should just be men or young adults. I had to look deep to find it but i read it in the USA, its original language is english and it was recommended to me by a youtube short, there are some similar titles and books but originally i found the exact same one that was shown in the video but now i cant even remember the name of it or how it looks. I just know that if i read the first couple of pages that i will know the book instantly. Alright to start off, the book has a weird but nice design to it that is very different from modern books from what i can remember it more old school-ish and is a hidden gem from the way that i remember from the youtube short that introduced me to it. Now lets get into the books details and initial story line from what i can remember about it. The full book is about pleasing a woman the proper way or at least the way the man was taught growing up, yes it is in a guys pov. It starts off from when he was younger and it had some lines about him being taught about the womans body and how to be gentle with it even though he didn't realize it at the time because he was so young. Apparently the male figures in his life brought him to a field of flowers and had him touch roses and do some other things that were normal but it was to heighten his senses so that he would be able to notice slight changes in a women. Then it fast forwards to when he's older and he was then brought to a house where he had to choose from a line up of women, all types and he would then choose which woman would be his teacher. He choose a more older woman and from what i can remember she smiled and the woman was also married with a husband and in the story iot said that he was so proud of her for helping other people into becoming men. (i dont wanna get too crazy with my interpretation of the description lol) So they never did any sexual acts until he was a bit older and they spent time together and from what i remember about the story they never did anything aside from oral seggs but i barley got through the book so i dont know. He would also bring up how he had urges but he was taught to control them by being with that women who was helping him. So, yes this is currently the book i am on the day and night hunt for and i wont b e stopping anytime soon. It took me so long to find it in the first place but then i accidentally wiped my hard drive and now boom its gone. If i can get a physically copy of it i will pay top dollar lol. I hope someone out there knows the title.

goodreads	22652200	1	Candace Heki	2024-06-27T00:00:00Z	I might be mixing up two different books, but hereâs what I remember about the book: * a girl gets pushed off a balcony? and gets amnesia. * we find out later on that her abusive husband/boyfriend pushed her, but she forgets all about him. * I think itâs her coworker or somebody who helps her through it and she has dreams or something about him doing all this romantic stuff for her and she thinks they are memories or something so she thinks he is her husband? * maybe it was just that he tells her heâs her husband or something, Iâm not sure * it also might have been that the main characters friend kind of conspired with the new husband to pretend that he was her husband to hopefully get her to forget about the abusive guy? I'm not sure. * the guy ends up doing all the stuff from her dreams and they end up actually falling in love and ârenewing their vowsâ but theyâre actually just getting married because they were never actually married. * she starts to get some memories back about her ex. His name might have been Simon but I might be making that up. Like one time her new boyfriend/husband? Tells her she should invite a friend over or something and sheâs like âSimon doesnât let me invite friends overâ and then she s all confused and doesnât know why she said that and stuff. I think thatâs all the main stuff I remember. Anyone know what Iâm talking about? I used to read a lot of kindle unlimited books so it could possibly be from there, but Iâm not certain. I most likely read this sometime between 2017 and 2020 Thanks in advance!

She is taken out of her bedroom window by her aunt and taken to a magical world TM. She is enrolled? into some kind of school? I remember that each """"grade"""" wore a different color robe (white, green...blue?). The thing that made the story unique is that the fairy/magical beings in this story could present themselves as anything they wanted, but I seem to recall horses being very common. Anyways, she is taken to a magical ceremony where the older girls get to be claimed(?) by a fairy-thing but then the main character girl like...bonds with them all? Or something?

goodreads	22677010	1	Michelle Glinka	2024-06-27T00:00:00Z	SPOILERS I read a book about 10 ish years ago about a girl driving home from college but sees a girl in a van that has been kidnapped. This is not NoExit. She follows the van and ends up at the kidnappers remote house. The kidnapper leaves and she eventually finds a way into the house and finds the girl. They escape and are driving away but the kidnapper is coming the other way down the road and sees them and starts to chase them down. Very good and thrilling book but cannot remember the name od the booknor the author.

More information I remember from book 2 is the girl best friend and former roommate is also mated to a wolf and they take her (the fmc) back to her mate's house and she stays there for a while with her mate in wolf form and he lives in a neighborhood with his entire pack. She finds out her mate is a writer and starts reading some of his books and discovers he's been stocking up supplies (feminine products, hair care etc) for his future mate. His alpha makes her a sandwich is something else I remember and there's a scene in the book where one of the pack members mate dies and he starts going feral.

I read it in September I believe and I had seen it advertised on Goodreads on the top banner. It was a hardcover. The man who wrote it teaches I believe in Cape Town at an university. He is the head, I think, of the team investigating other homo genus in Africa. They are do explorations of cave for this particularly species he has studied the last couple of years. He believes that they used fire and maybe even made cave markings. Some scientists disagree with his arguments so he is somewhat controversial. He lost 50 pounds so that he could go into the caves to get a look where they found bones and indication of the species. The species was smaller than homo sapiens. He got stuck on the way out and it took a while to maneuver himself out. Thanks you.

Read as a middle grade child around 2000-2005, felt a little older, might have been published in the 90's. Young girl, maybe 10-13 y/o, only has a dad. He's going west for the gold rush, and she stows away to go with him. I believe they went over land. He's understandably mad, and leaves her in the city while he goes to the fields (possibly San Fransisco, but I'm not sure). At some point he leaves her alone for a while, he goes missing in the fields I think? She moves into an abandoned ship on the harbor and makes it her home. She works for a laundry business for a while, and then starts her own business out of the boat. I believe it was a business making bread or hardtack for the miners, but she might have been doing laundry out of the boat as well. I remember her lowing goods down on a rope to people on the dock below. *it's NOT Gold Rush Girl by Avi, found that while googling :( SPOILER I believe in the end the dad was robbed/badly injured/very sick, but somehow finds his way to the daughter's boat.

He took her to his castle and during the journey their attraction grew and they fell in love, on arrival he realized his uncle has been the villian and lied to him, when the lady's father arrived he formed an alliance with him and helped him defeat his uncle after which he married the lady. I think the mmc is a france knight or roman.

Hero of that previous book was with her, in part, to protect her from issues in her family. I dont remember if the characters were in college or if they were older. -the hero of the book im looking for hates her but for some reason the heroine ends up staying with him at his house. Everyone would consider her a screw up, including the hero. - theres a scene where she leaves the heros house without telling him she was going to be back in a couple days. She left to take custody of her little sister. The hero thinks she left him and in retaliation he sleeps with her male friend. This friend was probably her only friend in that town so when the heroine comes back and finds out that he did this out of spite, she is devastated. - The heroine and her little sister moves out his home to another part of town. She gets a job and a place. The hero misses them. He has a room renovated for the little girl in hopes that they will be back. Thank you in advance for your help.

I think it was an ebook and the author was female Book genre: Historical romance fiction for either YA or New Adult Character descriptions: there a few characters in this book, I'll list as many as I can remember... *Main character - Young female (around 18-20 years old), blonde hair I think *Older brother - He gets a job as a banker *deceased parents *Brother's (best?) friend - works with horses *Cookie (It's the only name i remember, its the character's nickname) - owns the small town cafe/eatery/diner/restaurant & used to be a war doctor/surgeon Time period and location: I'm not sure what century could be anywhere from 18th to early 20th century. The story is set in the USA/US/America in a state like Oregon or Montana or some state like that set in a small newly established logging town. Language or country the book published: It was published in English, in US/USA/America Plot Description: *SPOILERS AHEAD* (view spoiler) [plot details: The book begins with the explanation that the parents had passed away and the father had made bad investments/choices so they were in debt. The older brother decides to pull his sister out of the college/university/ upper class education she was enrolled in which she hates and now how to cook and clean more at home because they can't afford to have maids and stuff. The older brother manages to get employed at the local small town bank. The town is close to a dock/port where she meets a ship's captain and then gets pregnant by him and he promises to meet her and taker her away with him (he doesn't know she's pregnant). She leaves and night to go away with him but he betrays her and leaves her abandoned. She has to tell her brother that she is pregnant out of wedlock. Her brother tells his friend who is a horse trainer/keeper/vet who travels with the logging company about the situation and he offers to marry her (the main character) because he is already a little bit in love with her. She tries to run away to the big city she lived before to make a living and not be judged but she ends up being stopped and told about the brother's friend's willingness to marry her. She eventually reluctantly agrees and they decide on a plan for him to (fake?) court her for a little while to make it seem believable before they marry. She starts to work to earn some money at the local diner owned by Cookie to help save money before she has the baby and to help her brother with the family debts. He takes her on rides in his wagon, as he pick her up and drops her off at work.They do this every day, there is one scene/day where he annoys her and she jumps off the wagon into mud (or something like that), it was a slight argument/miscommunication as she thought he was laughing at/mocking her. Eventually they begin to build a friendship/trust. They get married in a small ceremony and she moves in with her now husband. They spend time in their house for a few days (the day after their wedding is Sunday and they don't attend church) as part of their """"honeymoon"""" to convince the townspeople it's a legitimate marriage. They end up going on bushwalk/hike/trek to a nice waterfall where he teaches her how to fish with patience which she admires and begins to fall for him a bit. She falls asleep and he goes further away from her to not disturb her sleep and catch more fish. She wakes and finds herself alone and screams because she thinks he's abandoned her. He rushes back, she's angry, he consoles/comforts her and they make up. They begin to get a good routine as a couple going. He helps bring the bath in for her every time she needs and one time accidentally walks in on her naked. Eventually getting in and out of the tub starts to get more difficult for her, he notices and decides to build her an outdoor shower which takes time. She keeps working at Cookie's diner even while heavily pregnant and she get cornered and almost raped/assulted by a man from the town, the husband is away helping the logging people who suffered a disaster and need help with horses. Cookie get to her in time to help and when the husband arrives he finishes beating up the man who attacked her and then her takes her home & cares for her. Time passes and they fall in love, have the baby. At some point the sea captain who got her pregnant comes back to the port/doc near their town and she meets him to tell him off for being a womanizing coward and that in spite of him she has a wonderful child and husband and that she never wants to see him again and he will never see her child. And then they liver happily ever after. (This is book 1 of 2, which can be read as standalones, the 2nd book is about her brother who decides her wants a wife and sends an ad out for a mail order bride and an irish girl who dreams to be a business woman/seamstess/fashion designer decides to accept the offer.)

goodreads	22746505	1	Megan	2024-06-27T00:00:00Z	The book is a two parter and in the front pages of the book was something about it originally being an E-Book and actually published physically. 2 sisters are transported into the worlds of the book that the older sister writes as she is a popular author and they find their Significant Other in those worlds. One of them is sent to a medieval world where there's a dragon that sounds exactly like Sean Connery and there's a smeggs scene that involves a boat/ship rocking. And I remember some mentions of a advisor to the male lead telling him to be nicer to the female lead since her older sister did write nice husbands for ML's sisters to have. The older sister is sent to a futuristic cyber spaceship and is held captive by an alien or human male and at one point has a mind control device on her head so she can't run away from the guy. She also starts to get really bad migraines that have something to do with her younger sister finding her? The end of the book has the younger sister becoming a witch with powers and teleporting into the ship with her man and reuniting with her older sister. The younger sister also rides into the spaceship on Sean Connery sounding dragon.

She had more or less been groomed by her father to be the perfect wife for her intended husband. When she finally married, she got out from under her fathers abuse. The husband was nice and wealthy. But it was a classic story of them not communicating. When he saw some of the physiological damage she was dealing with he tried to minimize the fathers contact. Her mother/stepmother and her sisters wanted her back home so she would take the abuse in stead of them. She was a classical pianist. Her father stole all her earnings. Note. Abuse was physiological and somewhat physical, but not sexual.

goodreads	22768847	1	Lou Rocama	2024-06-27T00:00:00Z	I'm pretty sure I read this between 2011 and 2016. It's a very poorly written spiritual warfare thriller centered around a USA presidential election. There was a very thinly disguised Obama but no Trump, so I'm pretty sure it predates 2016 (but I'm not positive ). The title included a year. I'm pretty sure it was 2012 but might have been 2016 or 2020 (i.e. election years). There was a subscript to the title involving Armageddon or the apocalypse or the end times; something of that sort. I think the subscript involved how evil Islam is, but I might be remembering the cover copy/blurb. The copy I read was a trade paperback from the library. Probably createspace but might have been a small religious publisher. The cover was simple, mainly black. It might have a sun, or some flames, or a silhouette of a man in front of flames. It did not have a cross on it. I remember three scenes. The first is the Devout candidate debating whether to run despite his wife's illness. I don't recall if he was dropping out because his wife became ill, or if he was convinced to run despite her being ill. Second is the evil Islamic candidate discussing things with an advisor who unbeknownst to him is actually a demon or Satan or something of that sort. Third is the devout man's daughter getting out of a private Christian school. All of the students are protected from evil influences by guardian angels, but the daughter sneaks a copy of an 'unnamed' Popular Teen Vampire Romance Novel home in her bag. Not sure how she got it in the first place tho. This allows evil to get near her. I believe her thoughts on the book were 'sparkling vampires are WAY hot!' This is indicative of the writing style, btw. I did not read the whole thing, because it was not just poorly written, but also B@7$#17 ph|_|<|<1/V& insane. However, I am maddened that I can't find it. The collection of [end times] + year + politics is just too common. and it isn't on my shelves, thus making me sad.

The book was probably written after 2005 or 2010. The AI/robot destroyed/got rid of all weapons except for melee armaments because (paraphrasing) if humans want to kill, it'll let them do it up close and personal so they can feel the blood. I don't really remember much else. The girl may have been kept somewhere against her will? The place she was is probably closer to an orphanage than a prison. I don't think the AI was physically present for most of the story. Also, I think the AI may have been more of a dictator-type governmental figure than an overlord/human-enslaver. There may have been clones involved somehow. Can't remember if there was a sequel or not. I think the author was a woman but not 100% certain.

After the tragic death of her parents, a girl is thrust into a world of supernatural creatures, including wolf shifters and vampires (and others?). At the beginning of the book, she is trying to flee the ones who killed her parents She finds wolf protectors (beta twins?) who keep her safe. She eventually takes them as mates, along with others. She develops powers and is pursued. She has multiple mates and bonds with them. They teach her how to fight and defend herself. She has mate bonds with wolves and I think a leader of vampires. One of her mates (or the vampire) are wealthy and they travel to one (some?) of his houses to hide. One is hidden in the middle of a forest. They are found there and have to fight to get away. They are pursued a lot. I think her heritage is somehow tied to vampires as well as wolves (she may be a hybrid). This is set in our world in contemporary times (just with the supernatural tied in). Spoiler alert! The alpha of the pack tries to bond to her without her consent/ knowledge while she is hurt. I think he becomes an enemy. She has a vampire guy friend. I think he ends up bonding with a female wolf pack member even though this is forbidden (this is not the main plot). The female shifter started off as an enemy and became a friend. She kills the vampire leader's second in command (who is supposed to be uber-trustworthy) by cutting off his head when the second in command comes to warn the vampire leader he needs to go home. The vampire leader is horrified, but it turns out the second in command was setting him up. The girl ends up going to the trap and killing off many, many vampires.

So far here's the plot from what I can remember: The main character (a girl in high school) is at school, and her parents pick her up and don't tell her why. I'm not 100% sure, but I think they flew to Brazil without telling her why. She finds out her parents are separating (I think) and finds out she's adopted by papers she found at the hotel. She runs away and ends up shaving her head to hide her identity, and ends up sleeping on the beach, where her bag with all her money is stolen. She doesn't eat for days so a cafe she previously went to gave her cheesy potatoes. She also was staying at a house for really cheap, and used their old laptop to search for her bio mom. Later on she got a job teaching children English and I believe she had a co-worker named Jessica, idrk. At some point in the book, she's hiding her identity and runs through a parade and kisses a stranger in the parade. I remember the book ending with her bio mother being hit by a car. I'm sorry this is so badly explained, but I only remember some of the book, and the book was insane to read.

The cover was mostly blue and black I think? Maybe with a water or mirror scene? It was so long ago itâs hard to remember. This boy keeps getting in trouble because of his shadow doing bad things while looking like him. I have a vague memory of him seeing his shadow through a lake in the woods or something and I believe he goes out one night in search of his mischievous shadow and that may be the night he finds it. I have a vague memory of a bunch of crazy stuff happening the night he sneaks out to go after his shadow. I believe he ends up doing it all on his own due to the unbelievable nature of the dilemma. I also think itâs based in a small town? Anyway, he does end up getting his shadow back where it belongs and no more havoc is being wreaked in his name. Thanks in advance!

The rest will not start because they have electronics that have been fried by an EMP. The teen takes the popular girl home. He had never been able to talk to her before. They live in the same neighborhood. Later in the book, he ends up winning the girl over. He takes an older man that lives near him to town. They buy all of the water purification tablets from a pool store. The teen and the older man start to fortify the town by getting everyone to work together. They build a wall around the town. The teen has a small personal plane that he is building and learning to fly. Later in the book, the teen and man use the plane to fight against another group that has been attacking them. They drop grenades and molotovs on a small airfield. The book ends with a P-51 fighter plane guiding them into a landing strip. The plane that guides them in is a part of a group that is acting as a safe haven. I believe the book takes place in the United States. It is set in a post-apocalyptic time after all electronics have been wiped out. I read the book when I was in high school, 2013. The book was paper back and in English. Thanks in advance!				
goodreads	22795631	2	Alan	2024-08-05T00:00:00Z	I've come across a couple of possibilities, but they were all pubbed too late (2018) - unless there was an earlier edition that was not listed. Pulse of the Goddess , book 1 of the American Blackout series by Fred Tribuzzo, looks to be a possibility. The blurb mentions a light plane, but not a P-51 Mustang. The second book of the series, Slaves Beneath the Stars , mentions a P-51, though. All three books of the trilogy are listed as being pubbed in 2018 (the last two on the same day). The Reset by A.T. Avon has an EMP, plus a character who owns a P-51 Mustang. Bizarrely, it is described as Australian. It also dates from 2018.

None of these are it. The main character is definitely a male teen. The P-51 isn't a major part in the book. It doesn't show up until the end.

On the up side, it was published well before 2013 (1998). I started poking around with this out of pure curiosity - I was surprised that there was even one post-apocalyptic book featuring a P-51, let alone five.

There may have been other versions of the cover. Maybe a dozen Pagan and Wiccan authors wrote erotic stories for this anthology. One was Silver Ravenwolf. Another was Starhawk. I think Raven Grimassi was even part of it. Everyone used a lot of euphemisms. """"Drinking nectar"""" was a euphemism for cunilingus, """"peaks"""" were a euphemism for breasts, and """"valleys"""" were referring to vaginas or maybe genitals overall, in a few of these stories. The title was something about a goddess, or referring to a woman. There was an introduction to the stories, an afterward, and something that I think is called a bibliography. It's the part of a book that introduces each author and cites their work, and explains where else to find them (websites, social media, other books). Please correct me if it's not the right word. I don't remember who the publisher was. Maybe Llewellyn? Maybe Weiser? Red wheel? Unsure."	unusable			erotica

He actually did not. The heroine has trust issues. She gets married-I think it is arranged. At one point the H is wounded and the he gets a letter from his former mistress. The heroine was with him when he received the letter and smelled the perfume it was drenched with. The heroine and Hero do fall in love. He is aware that she has trust issues. I donât remember if her parents reconcile. However, I do remember a scene towards the end of the book. There is a party at their house and the former mistress is there. The Hero takes her to his study and they talk. He pretty much tells her that he is happy in his marriage. He may be holding the woman's hands. The heroine walks in. He introduces them and woman leaves. He is a little apprehensive about the heroineâs reaction to finding him together with his former mistress. The heroine tells him how easy it is for an innocent moment to look like something different. He is happy because he now knows that she does trust him. I vividly remember that scene in the study/library. Am pretty certain that the womanâs name was Lady Pamela. I donât remember the heroineâs or heroâs names.

He builds a treehouse in the back that he only lets them into. He sometime protrols it naked with a gun. He also helps the old ladies open a bar called Tarzan and Janes, that he and the old ladies take pictures for. I think the first one in the series, the guy is called Viper or Reaper. Not 100% on that. Also I think that the guy who suggests the one from the hospital is called Blade or Blaze.

From what i remember, both the main female character (Physical Therapist) and main male character (Football Player) lived in the same town when they wrre teenagers and went to the same high school. The football player asked the PT to prom, she said yes. A little bit later she finds out shes pregnant with his child, so she runs away, leaving him waiting for her on prom day. Fast forward years later, their older, she becomes a PT and he becomes a fanous football player. He needs physical therapy, he's sent to her without knowing its her (because of course they never had contact over the years) and they recognize each other immediately. He wants to start being with her again, shes hesitant because she doesnt want him to know shes had his child. She starts dating him anyways but she keeps her daughter a secret from him. Towards the end of the book he of course finds out her daughter is his daughter, he also funds out that their daughter have a health issue that is hereditary from him. He (i think?

He often watches her daughter when she needs a baby sitter. *i remember a scene where the PT and her best friend are coming to her house (cant remember if the daughter is with them or at school) and when she opens the door, they see her house is filled with flowers from the main male character. He leaves her a note. *i also remember that when they were ternagers, she was his tutor (i think) and thats how they began talking and eventually started becoming intimate with each other. *i believe the main female character had dark curly/wavy hair (im not too confident about my memory of that description though)"

goodreads	22810839	1	eldermillennialjuju	2024-06-27T00:00:00Z	Need help finding a book I started earlier this year, 2024. It disappeared from my App Library. Included a list of books I already checked at the bottom. The book starts with a young woman. She gets fired from her job, which she needs, because time is evidently also currency. She goes home to tell her father and sibling. Her father is elderly and her younger sibling does not have a timer yet. Her mother is passed. Later in the story she goes into the city square and sees a male friend she is evidently crushing on. But there is some sort of forbidden friendship there. There is some sort of mandatory time donation to the government. People die during these donations. She goes to a gate and donates almost all her time. Itâs described as kind of excruciating and she can feel like leaving her. Later on a tall dark city guard finds her and gives her some of his time. He tells her to lay low and not mention it to anyone. She is perplexed why heâd do such a thing. And she gathers he is probably in charge of other guards. The story suggests these two will be entangled somehow. This is where I left off. I started it as an audiobook and it was narrated by a female. Please help! It is *not* any of the following: In Time, Alexandra Bracken Everless The Time Keeper The Warehouse The Electric Kingdom The Sandcastle Empire Time Bomb

goodreads	22812040	1	Carolyn Comings	2024-06-27T00:00:00Z	This book MAY be part of a series but I honestly don't remember either way. I thought the author might be Sherwood Smith, as there are some similar elements to her Dobrenica series, but that is not the one I'm looking for. I went through all Sherwood's other book descriptions and none of those seem to match. Checking other authors, it isn't Shanna Swendson, it isn't Holly Lisle, it isn't Breeana Puttroff, and it isn't Jeffrey Poole. Nor is it on the cross world fantasy list I found here at Goodreads, or any other such lists I looked at. I read the book(s) I'm looking for some time ago, not recently, but probably no more than about 15 years ago at the very most, and it was likely an ebook, perhaps from the library, as I don't have anything in my physical book collection that could be it. (And I don't get rid of physical books unless I am absolutely sure I'll never want to reread them.) What I think I remember (but might have some details wrong): Adult woman is going about her business (perhaps in the general area of southern California) when something happens (perhaps strangers asking questions she doesn't know the answers to). She and her mother flee to the magical realm, and I think the protagonist had no memory of that place. At some point we learn that her father (who is from that realm and MIGHT be the rightful prince or king or some such) is long since missing and feared dead, and his disappearance might be the reason she and her mother (who was from our world) left the magical realm to live in our world. Protagonist finds some allies in the other world and together they embark on a quest journey but I can't remember what their journey goal is. (Could be to find out what happened to her father, but I couldn't swear to that.) * * * SPOILER: * * * Protagonist eventually finds her missing father who had been taken captive and put into a years-long sleep or something like that. Whether this happens at the end of a single book or in a later book in a series I can't remember.				
goodreads	22812040	2	Kris	2024-06-27T00:00:00Z	Carolyn, what are the main characters' jobs? Do they have special powers? Is this book for adults? Any romance? How is the fantasy world different from modern Earth?				
goodreads	22812040	3	Carolyn Comings	2024-06-27T00:00:00Z	"Well... the main character (who is an adult) I think is unaware that she had anything to do with another realm, so her job is something entirely earthly. But I don't remember what her job or career might have been. And I don't remember what level of magic and/or powers there might have been in the alternate realm. The fact that her father was kept hidden for all those years MIGHT indicate magic or special powers that kept him asleep but I couldn't swear to it. (And I couldn't swear that he was asleep for that many years, or just kept captive.) Definitely a book for adults, but I can't remember if there was any romance involved. (Other than the protagonist's parents getting together, about which we likely would not know a lot because it's the daughter's story, not the parents'.) And once again, I can't remember what differences there may be between our world and the other one. I don't recall whether there was some kind of language barrier, i.e. they don't speak English over there, whether the protagonist had to learn to communicate in their language or whether there was some magical """"universal translator"""" or some such. And I'm fairly sure that the other world is a typical non-industrial world, i.e. transportation is by foot or by horse and the weapons are bows and arrows and swords and clubs. Gosh, I haven't been very helpful, have I? :) I'm slogging my way through Googled lists of cross-universe fantasy books, but no results yet. Not even close. I've also gone through my Kindle and Nook libraries as well as my borrowing history at the public library, and the darn thing is proving to be quite elusive!"				
goodreads	22812040	4	Kris	2024-06-27T00:00:00Z	Would you say you read this book between 2009 and ____?				
goodreads	22812040	5	Carolyn Comings	2024-06-27T00:00:00Z	Hm. Based on my level of forgetfulness, I'd have to say 2014 at the very latest.				
goodreads	22812040	6	Carolyn Comings	2024-06-27T00:00:00Z	Yeah, my descriptions vary as much as they do because the only thing guaranteed to work flawlessly every time is my forgetter. :D Having said that, I think the nice lady (singular) that led her into the other world was her mother. It's possible, though, that some nice ladies were sent by her mother to take her to the gate leading to the other world. I'm pretty sure the protagonist lived in the greater Los Angeles area, and the gateway to the other world (whatever form it might be) was not terribly far away. And the impetus for whisking her away and into the other world MIGHT have been that some bad guys had figured out that she was the daughter of her father (who might have been their enemy) and maybe they came looking for her at her house...? I have a vague recollection of something like that. Again I can't remember more details but obviously she avoided whatever mayhem they had in mind and it seems plausible that she and her mother basically ran for their lives. No, it's not the Golden Compass--but just earlier this evening I was thinking of that book/movie but I had only the vaguest memory of what it was about and of course could NOT remember the title! So thanks for mentioning it. I might have to reread the book one of these days. :) In recent years I have made a point of listing books I enjoyed and would probably want to re-read at some future time on Goodreads--but this one must have been before that time, because it's not on my list. One of the closest candidates is Holly Lisle's World Gates trilogy. Because it's so similar I've scrutinized the rest of her books thinking the one I'm looking for could have been one of hers as well, but so far again no luck. Same with Sherwood Smith as far as similarity. And now I'm about to take another trip through my Nook library... wish me luck. :) And thank you for writing.

And I proved that I am right about my memory being quite leaky. :) The author is Sherwood Smith (I thought I had ruled her out), and the title is Sasharia En Garde. But there's room for confusion, because the story was originally published as two short novels, """"Once a Princess"""" and """"Twice a Prince,"""" published in 2008. Those are the ebooks I have. The combined current version was published in 2018. I got my original Nook e-reader in 2010 so I could not have read these books before then. Other things I got wrong: I thought Sasha (the protagonist) had no memories of the other world. Well, she did, and she spoke their language as well. (Holly Lisle's World Gates trilogy's protagonist didn't remember the other world until she got there.) I also thought there was no romance. Apparently there is. My bad. Finally, the other world does have magic. I was right at least about the protagonist living in the Los Angeles area. I also got it right about her father being the rightful prince or king who was overthrown and held captive in some sort of magical stasis until Sasha was able to rescue him."	solved / confirmed	Sasharia En Garde	18178447	solved and confirmed by OP / part of a book series: Sartorias-deles series

Another student had a blatantly obvious crush on the professor. I think her name was Prudence? She was supposed to be annoying and obnoxiously forward, but all I could think while reading it was, """"The author wrote her this way because MC got to the professor romantically first."""" The author was trying to set up a rivalry between the two women for the professor's affections, and I remember disliking it. The professor, who was tall and possibly with first initial H, let his student girlfriend help grade papers as their relationship progressed. She dropped a paper in shock when she saw it: """"(Prudence) had drawn hearts around her name in the upper right corner of the paper, signed as 'Pru.'"""" Professor looks over at girlfriend and she somewhat flatly describes it. She was shocked that Prudence was still trying for the professor's affection and being so obnoxious. Student and professor get married at a courthouse around the midway of the novel. A court messenger delivers an order for a paternity suit to the professor. """"It's too bad when a man's hit with a paternity suit on his wedding day,"""" he says sympathetically. Student is utterly shocked. It turns out the suit was brought by Prudence. Student storms out. She's understandably convinced her professor cheated on her with Prudence. A chapter later, both the professor and student confront Prudence. """"I'm so sorry,"""" she whispered. """"I didn't know what to do. My boyfriend left me,"""" she says, crying. Professor and student essentially just grumble at this, then go ahead and get married. I think the book ended on a HEA, with the professor retiring after his girlfriend got pregnant. I think this took place in the East Coast of the USA in the 1990s. I think it was a private university."

The below was a vivid memory recollection: The first part was started with a family, mum, dad and 2/3 teenagers children welcoming an exchange student in their home. They became best friends with their children. The mum was unhappy in the marriage. When the exchange student broke up, the mum cheered him and they started to have deep conversation. Then there was a tripto a holiday house, where they started to have a romantic relationship. There was a scene in outdoor shower where they were almost get caught by the dad. The student was lifting her up from the shower so the dad couldnt see her feetâ¦.. The second part of the story was when he returned back to his country and i had not finished the book.

(I don't remember how the villain came in possession of the ranch). Its a huge spread and has lot of guards. The H starts by getting hired a guard and there he meets the h. She is a very young and a virgin because her husband (the villain) is old and is not able to perform in the bedroom. Nobody knows this except the husband and wife. The h is attracted to the H and vice versa. Also, there is another lady who is a sister/companion (I am not sure which). There's also another hired hand who is cruel, I think. The H has a clear plan to exact his revenge and brings his friends/followers and there is a fight in which the villain dies and the H gets back his property. The H and h start to live together as husband and wife. H has a real hang-up about how the h has lain with villain and even when the h explains that her former husband was not able to perform, the H doesn't believe her. Then she gets pregnant and the H thinks its the former husband's baby and he slaps her. The h challenges the H that he will have to eat his words when he sees the baby. They fight and disagree on it. I don't remember what happens afterwards. If anyone knows about this book, please help me find it.

Like in most romance books go with this trope- she want's an anulment. Then she finds out that the H is her boss. I remember that they were gathered in a room and he went on stage to introduce himself- maybe he just bought the firm or something. I remember that his ring (that the h bought for him) is so cheap that colors his finger green. And it's something she noticed and was emberessed when she saw him for the first time after their night together. I don't remember exactly where they worked but I remember that she was painting some stage decorations. Someone wanted to hurt her and I also remember that some line was cut and something almost fell on her while she was on the stage painting. I also remember that she was pregnant- but I don't know if it was a result of that first night or if that happend after they started a relationship.

During that vacation, one of the young twin girls dissapears. Years later, the dad has died and now the older daughter takes her estranged remaining half sister to the funeral. The thriller is set both in the past and present. SPOILER ahead: you find out pretty soon the girl actually died of an overdose because the adults drugged all the kids so they could go out and party. They cover it up and get away with it. There is a plot twist in the last pages where you find out the overdose wasn't an accident.

The books opens with her struggles as she navigates a boat downstream to try and find help. She is disoriented and very ill and ends up in an, I believe Brazilian, Hospital. By the time she can communicate the need to help the village, and a medical team is dispatched the whole village is dead and the medical team must wear hazmat suits just to investigate. She goes to the US, because her last remaining family is there. In the US she stays with her cousin. She learns the world has become completely technology dependent to the point smart phones have been replaced by chips in the brain. Due to this instant access in the brain to the internet, GPS, phone calls, etc. School has quit teaching facts and now teaches research and logic skills to help everyone navigate the instant access to all human knowledge. She is offered a brain chip but declines as she believes it is against Gods plan to mess with the human brain like that. Because she declines the brain chip, she is isolated and unable to really navigate the modern world. Her cousin is unsympathetic to her choice. However, the cousinâs husband is more understanding and helpful to the main character and helps her when he can. The main story is the main character vs a large corporation that is trying to perfect the ability to transfer human consciousness into androids creating eternal life. It turns out the main characterâs grandfather helped start the company with a business partner. Now that the girl is back in the US, the corporation believes she has her grandfatherâs knowledge or notebook or something and are trying to get her. She believes her grandfather has dementia and is in a care home, but it turns out the corporation has brain micro-bots that can eat and affect the brain. Her grandfather doesn't really have dementia, his old business partner is keeping him ill, because the grandfather disagreed with the direction of the company. And the micro-bots cause the decease that killed the girlâs village by eating their brains. The reason the grandfather didn't agree with the direction of the company is in early testing of transferring human consciousness into androids they discovered this disconnects humans from their souls diving them insane. As one of the last remaining in the US who believe in God he feels it is wrong to disconnect humans from their souls.

goodreads	22822169	5	Patrick Oleary	2024-06-27T00:00:00Z	okay it looks like the book is called The Fire Sword by Adrienne Martine-Barnes. cover has a black wolf not a horse and a lady in white though not how i recall (this was a bout 1985), and she traveled around an alternate Albion to our own time frame. found some previews online so not sure where sacrificing a druid in the river came from in my memory (i could be confusing two books). if you use isfdb.org you can view by tags (fantasy) by year and view the various cover art over the years. also the first book in a generational series with 2nd published in 1988. the crystal sword, the rainbow sword, the sea sword are the others.	solved / confirmed	The Fire Sword	539464	solved by the OP

goodreads	22822451	1	Michael Hagglund	2024-06-27T00:00:00Z	I read this Fantasy novel 5-8 years ago. It's about a good, meaning moral and trustworthy, vampire chained alone in a large room by his enemies, who are also vampires. A young woman, I seem to recall that she's in hiding, enters the room. Trust is eventually established. There's a problem with sun coming in through the windows. She helps him. I don't remember much more than that, but it was an enjoyable, well-written book.

Following are the things I can remember, I read audiobooks: - Book is psuedo sci-fi. - It has a main character - who can bond himself with a leash. - It has a lot of royal houses that compete with each other for superpower beings - These superpowers are contained in an orb/box - It has a 'Great mother' character who has the power of telekinetics and possibly has a clone - Hero goes to multiple universes to reach a level where he can match the power of 'Great Mother' - The main hero acquires a dog and their bonding is superb - In the climax of the book/series - the hero gets the power and he and his team break into one of the rival royal house's castle.

The plot revolves around best friends that, after sharing a few drinks, have a one night stand, and the heroine ends up pregnant. I'm not sure, but I think the Hero is a nature/ wildlife photographer or a travel guide's writer. He travels the world a lot and has no desire to settle down. However, all that might change when he returns from an overseas trip and finds out his friend is pregnant. He is in shock when he finds out its his, and yet proposes for the baby's sake. I'm quite sure they have a daughter by the final chapters of the book, but I'm inclined to believe they're twin girls. Not sure about this detail. It's none of the books below: - Baby: MacAllister-Made by Joan Elliott Pickart - The Last Marchetti Bachelor by Teresa Southwick - Ready Set ... Baby by Christie Ridgway Unfortunately thatâs all I could remember. Thanks in advance for any help you guys can provide.

It's about a brother and sister who were taken in by the foster system and separated when they were in grade school. The sister gets placed in a home of a very wealthy family, but her parents are very strict and it's a very different lifestyle than what she was used to. She gets pregnant trying to prove she is straight but is secretly in love with a girl and she gets sent away to live with nuns and have an abortion. The boy gets arrested as a teen for trying to rescue the girl from a previous foster home. He spends several years in prison and is forced to join an extremist group to stay alive. Once he is released he fears the other prison members will come after him. The girl is in college during this story and falls in love with her social worker. She gets a message that her brother is in the hospital after she thought he died a long time ago. They go on a journey to visit the brother and he survives.

Itâs a romance book that involves a secret child. It might possibly be from Harlequin/Silhouette, etc. Itâs about a woman who has a one night stand the night of her husbandâs funeral. She later has a son from that one night stand but she pretends itâs her late husbandâs child. Fast forward a few years and the woman meets the man from the one night stand again. The child has to go to the hospital and the man discovers the child is his because of a family birthmark the child inherits from him.

I read this some time last year, and the plot has been nagging at the back of my head. A family in a village is attacked by a snow cat of some sort, and killed. The young man dies being thrown into a well, but his eyes glow and he is resurrected, losing all his memories. He is kicked out of the village due to the strange circumstances and works at a school or orphanage that a man in the village has contacts with. After a bullying incident a military man sees potential in him and recruits him for sword training. He quickly masters the fighting techniques, determined to be faster (I forget his main goal). Eventually there is a tournament to decide warriors to move on to an elvish academy of some sort, for training amongst the most skilled fighters. He makes it, and meets an elf that has flashbacks to his and her past lives, where they were apparently couple. I think he is a reincarnation of the world's hero of old or something. I don't remember past this point, or if they ended up discovering this connection. I tried AI with these descriptions, but it has miserably failed to produce results.

I remember the main character was a teen girl from Florida who get sent away to a boarding school/horse camp as punishment for something. I think it took place in the 1950's.

goodreads	22825948	1	Elena	2024-06-27T00:00:00Z	Hi, I'm looking for a romance novel where the main character (a woman) meets her ex boyfriend years later. She's in her 30s and works in an art gallery (or maybe owns one, I'm not sure) and met her boyfriend as a young art student in Venice, Italy, when they're both about 19-20 years old. From what I remember, he should be British and she should be American, and they had to separate once she had to go back to the US. It's mentioned that they tried having a long distance relationship but ultimately they broke up and never heard from each other again. One day, ten or maybe more years later, she meets him again (she lives in the US now) and spends the night with him. But she doesn't immediately recognize him and realizes who he is only in the morning, when she wakes up in his bed. And for some reason I don't remember, she's not happy about finding out that he's her ex. The female character reminded me a lot of Becky Bloomwood from the Shopaholic Series by Sophie Kinsella (as in, 30-something straight woman who's starting to doubt a lot of her life choices). I started reading the German translation (it was a paperback edition) in 2012-2013, but the original was in English. The author is female and I *think* she's British but I'm not sure. The original had probably been published between 2008-2010 and was set in those years. I never finished it, so I don't know anything else about the plot. Thanks

Iâm looking for a book that was published probably between 10-20 years ago. I think around 2012. I remember it being somewhat popular at the time. It was marketed to adults and not YA I believe. Iâve been looking through fantasy novels but Iâm not sure if that is the right genre or not. I think there was a kind of feel of magic possibly happening but it was not concrete. The main character is a women that is something like a historian who goes to possibly Europe to this old building (maybe a castle or mansion) to do research. Another of the characters is a young girl who is very smart and rich. There is at least one sequel and I believe in the sequel the protagonist goes to the girls house which is a mansion in an urban setting like New York. Thatâs about all I can remember.

It was a witty humoured book with detailed descriptions of characters and settings. The narrator befriends a male classmate and at one point it is described in great detail how ugly the narrator thinks the classmate is. The plot centers around a new middle aged female teacher and how this teacher affects the narratorâs life. There may have been some element of mystery / suspense to uncovering something about the teacher. I believe the teacher was an English teacher and there was something about a poem written by the narrator for the English class featured as part of the plot.

It's not Crystal Singer by Ann McCaffrey but it's supposed to be similar. I remember because when I first found the book, there was something written in the Wikipedia on it about it being close to it? But what I remember that it is supposed to be about is that for some reason, it is very important to cross the mountains (made of crystal I think) or maybe there is some reward of some kind, I'm not sure. But it's incredibly risky to do so because you have to sing perfectly the entire time. I'm not sure how old, but it's an older book. Similar to the Crystal Singer which was published in 1982. I believe it was a female author, if that narrows it down. I could be wrong but I'm almost positive. Any help would be much appreciated! Thank you!

I'm not sure why but I haven't been able to stop thinking about it for weeks. It follows the story of a young woman who is traveling across the american frontier when it was still very dangerous, and the entire caravan have soldiers escorting them. One soldier, the Captain I think, becomes her protector, but think there was somewhat of an age gap. Lots of run ins with tribes in the areas and if I recall, her family gets killed. I can't recall if the entire book was written from the perspective of her Diary, or if there were just parts of it written from that perspective. She and the Captain / general land up getting married and settling down, and with his work (either in the army or he might become a ranger), he's often away from home or in danger (she has a very bad run-in while he's away with someone who comes to their isolated home and has to protect herself and her child from this foe. He also has many near death experiences). At the end, she convinces him to quit his profession to take up something that will keep him safer and closer to home, and he lands up taking a position as a firefighter in their local town. In a cruel twist of fate he is killed in a tragic fire. (Hence the tears after a really hard fought for HEA) Would be so amazing if anyone could help me with this title! :)

goodreads	22829214	1	Ron Panarotti	2024-08-05T00:00:00Z	The cover image was either a phone or a van against a dark background. The plot involved either sinister phone calls or someone in the van snooping on people. But one detail I remember clearly. At one point, someone has a dream, possibly inspired by a movie on TV. It involves seeing a man standing on a mountain in a burning landscape. It's a description of the ending of Disney's The Black Hole, which came out in December 1979. Therefore this book had to be early 1980s. I know it's not a lot to work with, but if this rings a bell with anyone, I'd appreciate it. Just a book mystery I'm trying to solve.

goodreads	22831134	1	Janai	2024-06-27T00:00:00Z	Hello, I am looking for a book where the hero thought he had no âemotionsâ so he would create hypothesis on getting others to make him feel something. Read around 2017-202 Spoilers He had a childhood friend that fell in love with him but he didnât feel the same. She left and came back with a boyfriend but he wanted to see if she could be manipulated into liking him again. He used her emotions and she walked in on him with some other girl so she ends up sleeping with his dad but loses the baby. Fast forward to them being adults and now he is intrigued by the heroine that recently graduated. His childhood friend and him now have a âgameâ of playing with other peopleâs emotions and the heroine is the target of the game. The heroine has a record of having âstalker tendenciesâ by her ex boyfriend and her brother (I think) didnât believe her when she said it was a coincidence. Hero takes women to specific penthouse room and hadnât let other women into his home. The heroâs name was something like Hudson or Harrison. The heroines name started with an A and the heroâs dads name was Jack I think.

The other women are grown now and have their own issues. The dead girl's mother is diagnosed with cancer and she wants closure.

goodreads	22831589	1	Kamsi Eze	2024-06-27T00:00:00Z	I read this book in 2020, so it was written before then. It's a #fiction #drama #thriller #fashion type of book, from what I can remember anyway. The main character's name is RenÃ©e Dubois and I think the book starts with someone having had an accident then they start to tell her story. RenÃ©e came to a new city after her parents' death to live with someone, I think she had 2 siblings, I'm not sure but she has a brother. She ends up falling in love with some popular person or son of a popular person who also loves her, can't remember if it worked out at first though. (view spoiler) [Anyway, a lot of things happened, I know she, RenÃ©e, became a famous designer, her brother joined some kind of revolution/rebel group during one of these popular world events that had to do with a war.(view spoiler)[ They lived in I think Paris. RenÃ©e had a son with her first husband, then she got married again to, I think someone called Gary and had a daughter and her son hated her daughter because she was 'ugly' and stealing his mother and stepfather's attention from him. The story spills into their, her children's, stories when they're grown, including her brother's child or children. Anyways, I really loved the book but never finished it, I would like to read it again but I forgot the title, any help would be appreciated. Thanks. (hide spoiler)] (hide spoiler)]

goodreads	22831759	1	Kamsi Eze	2024-06-27T00:00:00Z	I read this book in 2019. I'm not sure it's really sci-fi though, but it has some qualities so.. Some school kids went on a trip in a bus and reportedly the bus wrecked and, I think, the kids all survived except her son whose body wasn't found. So she's depressed when suddenly her son starts communicating with her using electric waves or something like that to tell her that he had been abducted. There was a part where she was trying to convince this guy, who I think is her love interest, that she always thought her son was too special; the reasons she gave were: 1. A dog they had ran away and her son cried endlessly because he knew the dog had also died and not just run away 2. The first time he played poker or cards he did extremely well and won and she knew it wasn't just beginner's luck. Also, there was this part when she had decided to find her son herself that he communicated with her using I think a jukebox and another part where she enlisted the help of a hypnotist to help open her mind to communicate better with her son. Her son is 8 or more but I don't think he was up to 12. (view spoiler) [It was scientists who abducted him and they were running all these harmful tests on him.That's all I can remember. I would love to finish the book and any help would be appreciated. Thanks. (hide spoiler)]

Emlynn and former boyfriend find their mutual friend's camper van and decide to follow a trail which they hope leads to their friend. But the former boyfriend has ulterior motives for finding mutual friend--he and Bush are involved in drug running and Janessa is going to turn Bush in. Bush attacks the two women but the women prevail in the end and all are rescued. This book was recently published--I think maybe 2023 or 2024. I listened to the audiobook so I wasn't sure of the spelling of the main character's name. The only name for certain was the drug runner--Bush. Other character is Vargas (sp?) who is a forest ranger and he had found Emlynn naked and near death after boyfriend abandoned her. Hope this helps! Thanks :-)

Her son realizes the texts sheâs sending arenât really coming from her. He searches the picture of the man his mom is supposed to be meeting. It turns out that he is an FBI agent and catfishers used his picture to lure women on the picture on the dating site. The woman/ mom who was abducted is held captive in a box in the ground and they bring her out every few days to get her passwords for her accounts and gain other information to get more money from her and keep her family beliving that she is fine but choosing not to return home. This is huge scam they have quite a few others in boxes in the ground at the same time. Story ends with the big house on fire.. I think the book name has Fire or Pines in the title..

From my review: """"An evil mastermind named Titus has been stealing inactive online profiles from Facebook (and most likely Goodreads) and using them to bait lovelorn women and men with large-ish bank accounts. When the lonely losers respond to Titus's ads, with fake photos like Jeff's, he ropes them in and they agree to go on romantic vacations with these online profiles. Once these desperate fogies are in the limos """"headed"""" to their """"vacation destinations,"""" Titus kidnaps them and brings them to Pennsylvania Amish country where he rips off their clothing, hoses them down, and stuffs them in underground boxes to make them compliant. He brings them out of the boxes to get their bank account numbers and passwords. They turn over hundreds of thousands of dollars, which Titus deposits in Swiss accounts. Dana Phelps is a wealthy Greenwich widow who finds """"Jeff"""" online and is kidnapped by Titus. Dana's teenage son Brandon quickly realizes something doesn't seem right. He goes to the Greenwich PD but they won't investigate, so he hacks into the dating site and discovers that Kat has responded to """"Jeff"""" too. He goes to Manhattan and asks Kat to investigate his mother's disappearance."""" At the climax the abducted mother runs around and frees all the people buried underground in boxes, as people are shooting at her in the woods. There was probably a fire at the end.

She reconnects first I think with the best friend of her daughter's dead father who is an uncle to her daughter. The grandparents don't want her to reconnect because they blame her for the death of their son. She ends up falling for the best friend, the daughter continues to live with her grandparents but builds a good relationship with her mother. Read it I think between 2018 - 2022.

I remember the trilogy each had a color for the books; blue, red and green, so the covers stood out because they were pretty birght and almost completely that color. I can't remember FOR SURE but I think the first book was blue or red, the second was the other color and the green was definitely the third. Each book focused on a different couple but the second book was the relationship of the brother of the man/monster in the first book and the third book was the relationship of the two brothers sister. I don't remember much of the plot tbh, but I ~think~ the women in the first book was an investigator of some kind and thats how she got on the trail of her monster/man/mate	unusable

And another female character, covered more in either the second or third book, was a mermaid who left her pod to join them on this quest of theirs. One plot detail was that all three females went to go shopping and were advising the mermaid on how to tell the guy she loved, that she loved him. There were some more mature scenes in each book. I read the book from either 2015 to 2018. The book wasn't too old, fairly new I think. The book setting was modern, more country than city. One distinct thing I remember is that each cover of the book had a very artistic design, super nice to look at.	unsolved

The hero's name was Ben and he worked at her father's ranch. At first he coulnd't stand her because her aunt (the one who's place she took) was a bitch but he falls in love with her seeing she has changed. I think she has to stop the murder of her father and Ben which her aunt and some other guy plotted. I don't know why, but I've always thaught Linda Howard wrote this book but I couldn't find it anything to confirm that. I think the fact that in that period I read a lot of her books made me reach that conclusion.

I read this maybe 4-5 years ago (2019-2020) YA Fantasy vs Adult fantasy (as there are some hot sex scenes) female main character lives in a world where magic has disappeared, people used to be able to turn into animals and their prince was a golden dragon who flew through their lands. She is a healer of sorts and has a brother. She starts to heal people, magic starts coming back, she eventually can shift into a dragon, falls in love which the prince who was cursed along with the land? and plot twist: her brother can turn into a phoenix but has to be killed first.

goodreads	22839158	1	Michael Francis	2024-08-05T00:00:00Z	The book I am looking for was read by me in the 70's, so it could have been written going back several years. The general plot is that some kids/teenagers are somewhere in a western setting. At one time, a Native American terrorized the area to the extent that his legend lived on. While in the area, someone begins trying to kill the teenagers. Eventually, it becomes obvious that it is Asesino (that's how I remember the name, but it may not be accurate), the legendary killer. Somehow, at the end of the story, the killer himself is killed (I don't recall the details) and he always wore a mask or face paint, and when they examine the body, it turns out to be a white man masquerading as the legendary killer. Best of luck and thanks in advance.

goodreads	22840699	1	Kayla	2024-06-27T00:00:00Z	I cannot remember a whole lot about this book's cover besides that I think it had some sky on it? Not sure though. The plot was basically a woman had created some kind of AI program that people could use to alleviate their grief of a dying loved one. The program could sort through texts and videos of a person and create a sort of profile of that person that could then send texts/videos/calls to you. The less texts and videos you had of the dead person, the worse the program was at emulating them...I remember something at the end of the book about parents of dying children using the technology and something being said about how sad it was that the parents were using the small amount of time their kids had left to make them make videos/texts for the program to use after their death than the parents actually spending quality time with their kids. I'm pretty sure I read this somewhere around 2015-2019, but could be a couple of years off either way. I unfortunately did not add this book to my Goodreads profile for some unknown reason!?

However, there was one thing I will always remember, as it was repeated many times in the text. There was a litany of titles given to the comet, and they were repeated almost ritualistically. One of these titles, the one burned into my brain, was âCain-raising kind of comet!â I know this is not much to go on, but unfortunately itâs all Iâve got.

Halley's comet is depicted on the tapestry (embroidered artwork) as a harbinger of doom or prophecy ..."""" While I donât recall that specifically, it would be just the sort of thing that the book featured. While the action took place in the present day, there was a lot of exposition about the history of the cometâs previous appearances and the disasters associated with it. (It is often said that âdisasterâ means âbad starâ and is connected historically with comets. The English word actually comesâvia Middle Frenchâfrom the Italian âdisastroâ meaning âill-starred.â) Thanks for your response!"

Wilson is wonderfully weird, but this is moreâ¦ avant-garde? Experimental? It jumped around, non-linear, but not so far out as stream-of-consciousness stuff. In fact, it occurs to me that it might be limiting to even label it as science fiction. The story, to the extent that I remember it, was about the coming of the comet and the expected consequences and the efforts to alert and defend, so SF-ish at least. But not a straightforward narrative at all. It was not an easy read, it would not be most peopleâs cup of tea. In fact, I would not be surprised if the trade paperback was the only edition ever produced; it probably wouldnât have been popular enough for a mass-market paperback. But it was unique in my experience and had enough âWow!â moments that it kept me reading in spite of its difficulty. Which is why Iâd really like to find out what it is, because Iâd really like to read it again!"

A seires of things happened once they got to the place, they were trapped in couldn't get out, other inhabitants all wearing masks, one was a kid who when his mask was lifted it was found that he'd been forced to drink oil, another was a girl who was forced to burn all her dolls and always carried them everywhere. The new kids who just came to the place were supposed to replace the kids already there.

One that I remember was a woman who was maybe black and white striped and her position in spacetime could be absolute. Meaning nothing could move her and nothing could harm her. She was also crazy and largely unpredictable. I feel like maybe she liked the MC for some reason. I'm fairly confident that the story included cognitohazards as well.

goodreads	22845563	1	slauderdale	2024-06-27T00:00:00Z	"To recap the title: The adult female protagonist can hear the clothes in her closet talk to her and has an uncanny knack for personal style (?) She is certainly fashion conscious; I don't know if she is actually a fashion designer, but the book definitely touches on the fashion industry in some way, and there is a gay male character (friend?) who is a designer and who reveals himself at the end as *not* gay (he pretends at it to get by in the industry) and as being romantically interested in her. I think this is either before or after she tells him that she can hear her clothes talk to her. Eccentric, playful overtone, probably a pretty tame read - I don't remember anything graphic about it, anyway. I read this book in the early or mid-90s. Probably published in either the late 80s or early 90s. Adult rather than YA or children's, and essentially realistic fiction, despite the fact that she can hear her clothes talk to her. Paperback, trade paperback rather than mass paperback, and I don't remember the cover but it likely involved clothing and/or clothes hangers in some way. Could be British or Canadian, might be American. I went googling and found a Reddit topic, """"[TOMT][MOVIE][1990s-2000s] Fashion Designer Pretends to be Gay"""" that sounds dead similar, like the film they were looking for could have been based on the book I'm trying to remember, but none of the titles they came up with were right.

I think one student discovered this and it was a shared secret between the student and the teacher when the teacher realized the student saw her one night.

goodreads	22847732	1	Victoria	2024-06-27T00:00:00Z	"I can not remember the title of this book for the life of me and it's killing me. It was a double romance novel, both stories tied together. The first one was about a retired Vietnam solider, who became a man for hire, he was hired by a wealthy man to bring his daughter back from the jungle, where she was being held hostage in some drug lords plantation in the jungle. Turns out the woman already halfway had a plan to get out of there, and they ended up stuck in the jungle for several days. At one point a massive python drops on her shoulders and he kills it, she freaks out over all the blood. Cause she'd been held hostage as a child before, they bond. Hide out in a cave behind a waterfall I think for a few days. They make it out of the jungle but the drug lord finds them in some little village, she hot wires a car after watching him do it once, bad guy dies and they make it out and home safe. He then leaves her """"For her own good"""" She doesn't like that, and ends up doing other halfway dangerous stuff, he finds her on another job months later and they stay together after that. I think the woman was in her early thirties? I don't fully remember. Next story was about the other man's sorta boss? He was on a boat in the ocean, boat gets shot up, so does he. Ends up washed up on the shore passed out, where a woman finds him, drags him back to her house, with a stray dog she found. Nurses him back to health, they start bonding. Oh there was a vet in the story too, she helped take care of the gut shot wounds and the stray dog. She didn't have a massive role in the book. The bad guys who blew up his boat the first time, find him. He called the guy from the first story to come help, first guys now wife comes too. They all end up bunkering down in the house and having a shootout. Bad guys die, all is good. The man who was nursed back to health, leaves the woman, again with the for her own good, he isn't a good man. You know the whole shabang. She gets depressed, first man's now wife calls the other man and cusses him out and implies that his love interest is pregnant. She isn't but he shows back up at the house and they stay together after that. The book ends with the two men sitting on a front porch of the first guys house. Kids are running around the yard and one of the wives is pregnant and they all are talking and that's it. Happy ending all around. The cover was a ocean sunset, I think. I remember shades of orange and soft yellows. It is a older romance novel. Got it from my grandma but we can't remember the title or author. It was thicker too. Please if you can remember the name tell me, I have been trying to find my copy or a new book for years now. It haunts me and drives me up the wall not being able to remember the title. My sister thinks these characters were side characters from a different series that people loved so the author wrote stories about them to tie it all together.

goodreads	22851475	1	Lauren Dundore	2024-06-27T00:00:00Z	So I read this book around 2020, and not knowing the name of it has been bothering me for months. From what I remember, it was written by a male author. The plot is as follows-- two men live in the sewers below a large city because they are different. They scavenge for food at night and have to stay hidden because people/society will try to kill them. Years go by and the older man dies. The younger man witnesses a young woman being attacked in a library at night by some strange men. She is trying to find her father's killer and she has a severe touch aversion. They go on an adventure around the city together to try to find her father's killer. Here is where my memory gets fuzzy. There is also an element of the supernatural/angels from what I remember? At the end it turns out that the reason that the men had to hide is because they were too beautiful? The very end of the story culminates in a plague or virus of some kind.

The comtempoary adult romance book follows a woman who runs away in her wedding dress by hopping onto a small plane (i think set in america and she goes north) she ends up in a bar in this town where the plane dropped her off. The bar owner helps her out & gives her job and a place to stay and romance stuff happens. I don't remember much abotuth the female lead but the male lead is the bar owner. He's taking over the bar from his father who has passed away and there is something in the will that requires him and his brothers to return to town and help run the bar for a year(?). I think there is a military brother, twins who make music, a tech brother at uni/college and the book continues in a series that follows the other brothers where they find love.

The whole series is a sequel to the """"Elenium"""" series. Here's a description of the woman. Melidere is a blonde haired, blue eyed baroness who also accompanies Ehlana in the visit to Matherion. She appears to be wide eyed and dim witted but this is in fact a ploy that she has constructed to protect herself as people are intimidated by âpretty intelligent women.â This ploy is particularly directed at Stragen as it amuses her, but eventually she drops it in front of all of them. Her father was not born a Baron but was in fact a simple blacksmith until he became rich after inventing tools that shave gold off coins, remill them so itâs undetectable, and hiring them out â it is stated that no gold coin in Eosia is in fact its correct weight thanks to him! With her inheritance Melidere paid an old Baroness to step aside for her, she also used her fatherâs invention to blackmail Stragen into a relationship with her by offering him the boundless riches that could be gained through the Daresian continentâs untouched coins and if he doesnât agree sheâll have him killed. Though the wedding she proposes seems incidental to the business plan she had been slowly seducing him as they travelled across the Tamul continent.

The book follows the relationship between the mother and daughter, who (from memory) becomes pregnant at a young teen-age. They may have gone to live in a remote cottage, possibly on an island (Kangaroo Island??...or a Tasmanian island). It's a little off-key, almost a psychological thriller yet also a very in depth examination of the power dynamics between mother and daughter, and their obsession with food, especially cake. Written brilliantly, and would love to read it again. Appreciate any leads! (Apologies for previous post not meeting the rules!)

It was one of my mum's literary/feminist type fiction books, so I had it in my head it was published by Virago, but that's just a guess! The main character is a mother who leaves her family to go and live alone in a cabin(?) in the mountains(?) - certainly somewhere away from other people. The setting makes me think it was the US rather than the UK. I particularly remember a scene of her sitting outside the cabin sanding an old table, and it making her hands hurt but she keeps at it until it's really smooth, then oiling it and the wood being so dry that it drinks up the oil. I think she drives into the nearest town once or twice a year to get supplies, so I think she stays in the cabin for at least a year or two. I think her daughter finds her (the daughter is a young adult), but I can't remember if she returns to her family in the end. This is all super vague I know, but any help would be appreciated!

goodreads	22857164	1	Jmegan	2024-07-27T00:00:00Z	The story is a first-person narrative, from the POV of a teenage girl, probably 16 or so. She lives with her father, just the two of them and not by choice - the mother's absence is an important part of the story. Father and daughter have a difficult relationship - the one scene I remember is he made her kneel on the kitchen floor as punishment, while he sat at the table reading the newspaper. There may have been rice involved, as in either he made her kneel on uncooked rice, or he threatened to, or she was grateful that he didn't. I don't believe the father is actually abusive to her, IIRC it feels more like he's trying to do his best under difficult circumstances. Additional details: *Takes place in a small town or farming community *Setting is contemporary to the time it was written - I think early 2000's *Probably a female author, probably Canadian *It's a coming-of-age story, character-driven rather than plot It has the same kind of feel as A Complicated Kindness by Miriam Toews, but I just re-read it with that scene in mind, and it's definitely not the right book. I appreciate everyone's help on this!

The other people Author:C. J. Tudor (Author) Summary:""""The gripping new thriller from the acclaimed author of The Chalk Man and The Hiding Place, about a man desperately searching for his missing family who falls under the sway of a sinister support group with a murderous agenda. Three years ago, Gabe's family disappeared. Most people think they died. Some of them blame Gabe. Hardly anyone believes the truth--that Gabe saw his daughter the day she and his wife disappeared, smiling at him from the back of a rusty old car speeding down the highway. So even though it's been three years since that day, Gabe cannot give up hope. Even though he has given up everything else. His home, his job, his old life. He spends his days travelling up and down the highway and sleeping in service stations, searching for the car that took her. It's hard for most people to understand. But Gabe has found some who do in an online group set up by people who have also lost loved ones--who have suffered like him. They call themselves """"The Other People."""" Because isn't that what everyone thinks: bad stuff only happens to """"other people."""" When the car that Gabe saw driving away that night is found in a lake with a body inside, Gabe is suddenly under suspicion--and in danger. In desperation, he turns to The Other People for help. Because they are good people. They know what loss is like. They know what pain is like. They know what death is like. There's just one problem . . . they want other people to know it too.""""-- Provided by publisher Print Book, English, 2022 Publisher: Anchor Canada, Toronto, 2022"

Maybe the Employer/main guy is a rancher? They are attracted to each other. He has the use of only one eye and wears a patch. She is best friends with his sister until the sisters boyfriend makes a play for her and the sister gets jealous and lies about her to the main guy. He believes his sister and is furious with the girl and chews her out and humiliates her on Main Street calling her ugly names and telling her to never come around again. She graduates with no one to watch her & celebrate with her and moves away that same day. The main guy wonât let his brother and sister even say her name around him. She is hit by a vehicle and the doctor finds a paper with the main guyâs name & number and contacts him- Very similar to Wild Obsession. The guy flies his sister and younger brother in his own plane to go to her and bring her home. They resolve their differences. The sister is sorry she lied and she is so impacted by the nurses at the hospital that she decides to become a nurse. This is the basis for a sequel about her and her love interest which is very similar to Lietha wardâs book, Seth & Priscilla.

I believe some part of the blurb, but definitively a plot point, was it's a girl (late teen? early 20s? ) who lives at home and her parents are professors who aren't really into parenting her and they have students/drifters who stay and she catches one looking at her as she is laying out by the pool and before he can do anything bad to her she murders him and buries him in the back in a well. Because nobody seems to notice he's missing, she seems to get away with it. She does the same with at least one other person (don't remember if it's a man or woman) and moves away but not far away because I remember at the end she's driving back to the house because her dad sells the house. Maybe the mom leaves the dad also at some point which spurs on the sale of the house, the marriage seemed kind of open with maybe him traveling and the mother """"entertaining"""" the male drfters. The girl is the main character, I can't remember if it's written in first person. Thank you in advance if anyone can tell me, it's been driving my sister and I nuts!"

Booklist says: """"Blending the supernatural thriller with hard-boiled crime fiction, Australian Irwin, in his second novel, which follows the acclaimed The Dead Path (2010), depicts a bleak future. Three years after Grey Wednesday, on which the earth's poles suddenly switched, unemployment is rampant, while food and goods are in short supply. Perhaps most devastating of all, however, was the appearance of the ghosts. All are now haunted by the eyeless specters of people they once knew. As a result, suicide and murder rates have skyrocketed, and a unit has been created within the police department to exonerate perpetrators driven to murder by their ghosts. Rumpled, dogged detective Oscar Mariani works in that unit. He is poorly paid, constantly under threat of being shut down, and disrespected by mainstream policemen, many of whom are corrupt. But then he catches the case of a young woman whose body has been badly mutilated and marked with occult signs, and he is convinced her murder is connected to the highest levels of government. How he goes about solving his case while weighed down with guilt over his failed personal relationships provides much of the suspense in a story that also offers cinematic descriptions of a rain-drenched, ruined Brisbane and smoothly incorporated supernatural elements. A unique and thrilling blend of horror and crime."""""	solved	The Broken Ones	11808571

A local young man sees the ad and since he is adopted, he thinks she might be his birth mother. then there is a teen girl who is pregnant (dad is not in the picture). They all move into the house and start ordering food and other things using the rich people's accounts. The young man is a thief and (I think) would-be actor.

It was an older book for that time already, written in English, and the author was a man. Each chapter was about socio-political issues, and it was organized in alphabetical order. I remember the first or second chapter specifically being about abortion in this context, with the author going into historical and political context for each topic. My copy was hardback with a sleeve with at least an inch of text between the covers. Unreliable memory: I think the book's cover had large lettering on the front with not image. A though I have searched it, I thought it was called P Is For Prejudice, alluding to the alphabetical organization of the book; it must have had something along those lines for its name. Also, I faintly remember looking up the author and seeing he was either a cabinet member or an advisor to a past president; I think he had worked with a Conservative Republican president, maybe Reagan or Nixon. My gut says Reagan. I would guess the book is from the 1980's.

goodreads	22865670	1	Alan	2024-07-27T00:00:00Z	Back again, with yet another one. Age group: adult Genre: historical / action-adventure Date: 1960-1990 (read it early 90s), but most likely 1970s. Origin: probably British. Standard: trashy. Plot details (so far as I can remember): Book is written from PoV of the Red Baron, Manfred von Richthofen. He is shot down in early 1918 (as in reality), but survives (unlike reality), and wakes up in a British hospital. After a celebratory bonk with his nurse, he is recruited by British Intelligence to fly a large biplane bomber on a mission to Russia to rescue the Romanovs (Russian royals), held captive by the Bolsheviks. He flies to Russia via the Middle East, with nurse in tow. Various adventures ensue (don't recall what, however). I don't recall much about the plot, other than it was mainly action, and that it featured several sex scenes, including the shag with his nurse in hospital, and being partially stripped and extensively groped while sneaking through the harem of some Middle Eastern dignitary. The numerous sex scenes give the book a distinctly 1970s feel (also, the book looked somewhat aged when I got it). The writing is (from memory) of pretty low standard, though it may have been (semi-)satirical. There are some in-jokes in this book, such as encountering detectives called Thomson and Thompson. One of these refers to women as 'crumpet', making me think this is more likely to be of British origin than American (or other English-speaking country). Possible spoiler: not sure about this, but think the aircraft was destroyed by a misdirected signal flare, which set it on fire. Cover: don't recall clearly, but think it had an aviator (dressed in flying gear) in front of things apt to the book - biplane bomber, horsemen, etc. Though I am not confident about this. Progress so far: Had a look at the 'Fiction featuring the Romanov family', but did not find anything - almost all are too late (since 2000). There was one book from the 1970s with no description (something by Geoffrey Trease), but the cover identifies it as a children's novel, which my book definitely is not. There are no possibilities on 'The best Romanov books' or 'Romanov retellings' lists either. I discounted the YA / teen lists, as this is clearly not intended as a teen book (though I read it when I was a teen). I also googled Red Baron Romanov fiction, but the only suggestion was The Bloody Red Baron , by Kim Newman, but this is not it. It is far too late and features vampires, which this book does not. As always, thanks to all who make suggestions.				sexual content

It is a work of fiction that explores an alternative history where Manfred von Richthofen survives being shot down and is recruited by the British during World War I. This novel provides a speculative twist on historical events involving the famous German fighter pilot. I am however having difficulty confirming this book exists."				
goodreads	22865670	3	Alan	2024-07-27T00:00:00Z	Thanks Terri. Sounds like a possibility - if such a book exists. I can't see it on Goodreads, Librarything, Open Library or Kindle. I had a look through Townshend Bickers' books, and he wrote some fiction about WW1 pilots; the protagonists were mostly English, however. He also wrote about von Richthofen, but non-fiction, and too late (1996). Perhaps ChatGPT has mashed them together. I generally don't bother with ChatGPT - it just makes stuff up.

What I remember of the story - Girl & guy meet on a busy commuter train (possibly in London?) as the share a laugh over a news article in the metro newspaper relating to a flying squirrel that can ski I think?. They then discover they work at the same place. I believe he's new and she already works there and he's potentially her boss / senior. I think is possibly a newspaper or magazine business. They have obvious chemistry but I think he's come out of a relationship that started at work and ended badly so has vowed to never do it again... but of course they have chemistry and fall for eachother in classic workplace friends to lovers fashion with of course the odd obstacle in the way. I remember the female character lived with her dad and was somewhat of a carer for him. Can't remember his specific condition but do remember he wore a helmet most of the time as he was prone to fainting or falling maybe? That's about as much as I can remember but it's driven me mad on and off over the last few years... so much so that it's led me to create a Reddit account specifically for this lol so thank you in advance for any help anyone can offer!!

One day, she meets her brotherâs friend and they discuss about books (he talks, she writes). He is a musician who becomes famous and goes on tour, leaving her. They continue to discuss about books through letters, but one day, he write to her that he has a girlfriend and she stops writing to him.

There was a college woman who was in a car accident or her car broke down, she walked into the woods and ended up in Fairy (I think). She was set to marry the prince (not entirely of her own will), who was horrible, and escaped out of Fairy and ended up with a cranky old magician. Some quest that I can't remember. It involved a wooden flying contraption that barely worked. There was a library where the books were alive? Or the characters popped out of the books? There was a legendary female magician - sort of like Cadsuane from Wheel of time. A jaguar or leopard, maybe? At the end, young woman realizes she loves the cranky wizard. Maybe he reciprocates, but probably not. Any ideas?

I have this sense of her as being quite cool and logical, so probably something maths based, but that's really just a guess. They were friends before they got together - I think the male character would talk to her about his relationship. I think I remember a semi-explicit gay sex scene in the kitchen, but I couldn't swear to that being the same book. I'm now beginning to wonder if the woman's full name was Victoria and I've imagined the bit about it being something like Torquil with some conflation of the guy calling her Tor and the sense of her being Scandinavian.

The journalist's husband and the lawyer bond over childcare and start falling for each other. The journalist's husband serves the lawyer pasta where the sauce is baby food.

goodreads	22871838	1	Leanne Cheshire	2024-07-27T00:00:00Z	Hi I read a motorcycle club book series last year (2023) and I stupidly forgot to note them down on my Goodreads profile,I have searched in every way I can think on Google and I cannot find the names of them. Any help would be really appreciated. Itâs driving me crazy. Book 1 of the series the female main character gets dared to go to the local motorcycle club by her friends and the male main character follows her back to her friends and threatens them all. Canât remember much else about the plot but I do know that the female main character owns a strip club that she inherited off her uncle. I think at the end someone gets shot in the strip club when a family member tries to take back the club from her. In another book the motorcycle club is tasked to look after the daughter of I think a senitor/someone powerful and the male character ends up looking after her at her apartment and falling for her. He is messed up about relationships though as he had an ex that died and he blamed himself. Another book in the series is the female main character is the best friend of the female main character in book one and ends up babysitting for the male main characters son. They fall for each other but his ex kidnaps the fmc and his son. She escaped (after horrible things happen to her). The club find the ex with another motorcycle club and when saving the son the female gets shot saving the boy and so does the club president (who is also the male main characters dad) and they both die. The male character ends up leaving town with his son and a woman from the club that had an emotional relationship with the president and has been his friend for a long time. They fall in love and move back to the club together. There is a scene in the book where the dead dad/president and girlfriend that died are watching from heaven over the couple.

goodreads	22871850	1	Leanne Cheshire	2024-07-27T00:00:00Z	Hi. I read the 1st book in this duet last year (2023). Female main character is scared to leave her house she has a fear of leaving and it turns out later in the book it was because she was stuck in a train cart when the 9/11 attacks took place. At the beginning of the book her sister/stepsister talks her into leaving for a club and she takes a pill to call her down and ends up passing out in the club which is owned by the male character. Male character takes her home to her apartment. Male character and his brother own the club, they took it over after their father was sent to prison after being investigated by the FBI for I think drugs and are cleaning up its act. Later in the book the male character flys to Paris for a wedding (I think his friends) and ends up being in the club when the 2015 Paris terror attacks took place. He and his friends survive but one is badly wounded. The next book is about the other brother and the female character is an undercover FBI agent that was working the club case when his father was the owner, she got close to the male character but disappeared, I didnât get to read that one.

goodreads	22872905	5	Kris	2024-10-05T00:00:00Z	"Juan is still looking for this book: """"Realistic fiction novel with a near completely black cover with only the name of the book on the front in red text. I don't remember much of the story though, unfortunately, as I never ended up reading the entire book. Read around 2016-2017. (Update) A bit of a disclaimer: I opened a different thread awhile ago centering around the same book, but I deleted the topic because I didn't know how to bump a thread, and I made a few mistakes. But I've since read through the group rules and am ready to post a definitive thread. This was a middle-grade book I picked up in around 2016-2017. The reason it jumped out at me was the black cover and the name of the book in red text on the front. Admittedly, my memory of the story is hazy at best. But what I do remember reading left a very powerful impression on me. The narration was in first person present tense and the narrator had a very cynical view of the world, from what I remember. His relationship with his father appeared rather poor, and he didn't seem to have a very enjoyable home life. One of the things I remember clearly about the book is the narrator (presumedly middle school aged) having a friend named Bird, who was called that because of his large nose. But he was reluctant to call him his best friend because they both have a crush on the same girl and, as he states, """"a best friend doesn't like the same girl as their best friend."""" But this is where the details become muddied for me. I read a lot of books around that time so there's a chance that some of the scenes from other books might have influenced my memory of this book. Though I feel it's still worth including, keep that in mind for this next paragraph. I believe there was a scene in a mall with the narrator and his friend, Bird. This was where Bird was introduced, and it was explained that they both have a crush on the same girl. Just then, they see the girl they both like in the mall. Bird then rushes to her to do or say something (I don't remember) which would embarrass the narrator. The narrator is desperate to stop him and so he chases him. That's the last thing I remember of the scene. Now onto what's more concrete. After the scene in the mall, it's back to the narrator's house. I vaguely remember some kind of altercation occurring between him and his father, but I could be wrong. What happened next is what really stuck with me though. The narrator walks into his room and sits down on his bed, talking about all these inconveniences in his life. But then he suddenly speaks to the audience, referring to the reader as """"you"""" as if they're a character in the story. Unfortunately, that was where I stopped reading. I don't know if that was the end of the chapter or if I just stopped reading for one reason or another, but that sudden shift from solely first person to second person seriously threw me for a loop and stayed with me for years to come."""""				og request

goodreads	22878455	1	Sarika Singh	2024-08-27T00:00:00Z	The genre is YA Fantasy. A woman from Faerie comes to 1980s Earth. I think her name might have been Krista, but Iâm not sure. She has long, red hair and speaks with an Irish accent. She speaks Irish Gaelic sometimes in the book. She is an accomplished musician and plays the harp. When she comes to Earth, she lands in an urban American city, maybe someplace in California. She meets some musicians and decides to start a rock band. She learns to play the electric guitar. There is some Irish mythology mentioned in the book. Maybe something about the Seelie Court or how time passes differently in Faerie compared to Earth. There is a racist scene in the book that shocked me. A white, male musician decides to have sex with a black woman (who may have been a band member). But when he is having sex with her, he calls her the N word. The black woman is devastated by this. This scene really struck me at the time. In one scene, they go into detail about the various different band instrumentsâthe guitars, the drums, keyboards, and synthesizers. It had a very heavy 1980s vibe and was probably published in the 80s. I read it in 1988. The Cover looked like a typical Fantasy cover. It had a woman with long, red hair standing. She may have held a harp or guitar in her hands. There was a Faerie setting in the background.

He wore glasses and was, according to the scene I remember, a bit chubby. When they were up against one of their suspects (or someone they had to scrutinize, not sure if he was the bad guy in the end but they just needed to hide the fact that they were detectives), he pretends to be really dumb, and the dismissive adult man, specifically because he's stereotyping the chubby boy, believes it. Later in the book, though, the man shows them a jewel and reveals something about it being real or fake in question form, the boy replies, and his answer clues the adult man into the fact that the boy is actually really smart, which he'd already suspected. The adult man is very triumphant about this, for some reason. I remember thinking I should've read this series from the beginning, so it was probably not the first book in the series, but then I never did read any of the other books and now I have no idea where it comes from. Read between 2009~2014, but it wasn't a new book then.	unusable			series

I remember almost zero details of it, except that there were three books (I only read the third). It had a similar vibe to warrior cats. I think the main character was a black unicorn and the leader of the herd? Or at least the chosen one. He had special blood that protected him against [evil force I don't remember]. At one point he used his horn to cut his leg to share his blood with the non-special unicorns. I also remember he had a son, and there was a female unicorn who I assume was his wife. And towards the end there was a battle with some evil monster?? If you have any idea what I'm on about, please let me know, it's driving me nuts.

The main character is a preteen girl, possibly named Rose. Her aunt Rose was, as she is constantly told, beautiful, smart, kind and perfectly behaved. This aunt died, family history goes, in a fire in their apartment building (maybe in NYC?), after the girl awoke, alerted everyone to the smoke, and then died because she went back into the building to rescue a dog (or something similar). The younger girl, the niece, has grown up fascinated by but also hating her dead aunt, because she is expected to be """"just like her"""" as she was named for her. It comes out at the end of the book that """"Aunt Rose"""" was NOT perfect - she was a nasty girl who teased her younger siblings and cousins viciously, and they all hated her. In fact, it was the main character's mother who set off the fire alarm and saved everyone, but she claimed at the time it was Rose because she was afraid of getting in trouble for setting off the alarm. Rose died because, after getting out, she went back after a cigar box full of stolen """"treasures"""".

I read this book in the early to mid 1990's but I think it was the readers digest version and might have been published in the 70's-80's. I spent a summer at my aunt's house as a young teen and was absolutely desperate for reading material. The main character is the daughter of a former child star named Bunny Something, it is set in Hollywood and is mainly about the daughter trying to take care of both of them as the mother is neglectful and never quite grew up. A major plot point is the daughter learning jewelry design and then starting a scam where she designs pieces using her mother's jewels and then swapping out the actual gems for fakes when they are bought. I have a vague memory of there being a romance sideplot with an Englishman? And something about the mother having a career comeback? I think there's an epilogue set in the future where the daughter is happily married and living in England? I have looked in every search engine I can find but using the terms child star and bunny always throw it off and I can't remember anything else specific enough to narrow it down. Thanks for the help!

From what they remember, the book cover was black with a bleeding heart. They're also pretty certain they got it in a Scholastic bookfair. Spoilers Ahead!: (view spoiler) [ The book itself is about little red riding hood, who teams up with jack (from jack and the beanstalk) to save her grandmother? There's also elements of embroidery (the grandmother stabs someone in the hand) and torture, where red riding hood has to save the other, captured fairytale members (Rapunzel and Hansel + Gretel are the ones that they remember).

I specifically remember something she used to jam in cracks to help climb walls. To the public she was prostitute, a highly trained and highly sort after one. Grew up as orphan or similar where they were all trained to help with the assassin & spy thing. I think she got into the Emperor's palace and became friends with his sister. I dont specifically remember much magic except MAYBE something to do with music or sound. It would be odd if there was no magic though, because thats pretty much all i read (Fantasy/SciFi) I dearly want to read this again. I hope someone can help. TIA

goodreads	22887082	1	Michelle	2024-09-05T00:00:00Z	Genre: childrenâs- to early teens-ish, fiction, fairy tale retelling, anthology of stories told within another story Plot: (POTENTIAL SPOILERS) An unknown aspiring author (MC) writes his own versions of fairy tales. (I think, from what I remember) they are based on âreal life eventsâ within the bookâs universe/what the MC observes - the setting is fairytale-esque; if i had to guess, something like old English or so (think cobblestones, milkmaids, cotton dresses and aprons) He lives in an attic and when he writes, he has a habit of rubbing his temples when heâs thinking hard. One of the stories is the emperorâs new clothes (I think; and I donât remember the others). His foil comes in the form of a little girl off the street who enters his life when she tries to steal from him (if I recall correctly) and he tolerates her presence and her constant ingratitude and attitude and her criticism of his stories. She becomes his first reader. The book takes place over many years and several fairy tale retellings, all within the larger context/story of the slowly becoming-old man and the girl, who always reads his stories and most often has some negative feedback for him. She never tells him her real name, or perhaps she doesnât have one (wouldnât be surprised as a homeless street urchin); every time she appears, she tells him her name is something different: one day it is Tailor, because she is working for (?) a seamstress, another time Tiler because she scampers about on the tiles of the rooftops, I think another time Toiler because she is unhappy with how much work she feels she must do to survive. (For this post weâll call her T.) The MC is always kind to her even though she never thanks him. Eventually MC writes an original story of his own and excitedly waits for the girl to come read it. The story is about a girl and her dog - itâs a Cinderella-like story (I think), and the girl trains the dog not to bark or make any sound that could give her away (I guess she is in hidingâ¦ details are fuzzy). Then the dog is separated from her for some reason - he is found by the trainers and they take him to become a hunting dog (or something like that). He learns to bark and to make a lot of noise, and he nearly forgets who he was and the relationship he had with his original owner (a la Black Beauty). But in the end, the dog and the girl are reunited. The girl is no longer in hiding and the dog remembers who he is and who she is. Although the girl tells the dog he can now bark as much as he likes, in honor and respect, the dog never barks again. MC excitedly shows T the story but is disappointed when she hates it. Overall, however, her reaction is in keeping with her character. Over the years, MC tries to sell his stories, at one point I think even printing them himself and handing out sheets of paper in the streets, but they never catch on. T, meanwhile, is growing up, and one day she comes to MCâs attic with someone who presumably is a boyfriend. She announces her departure and thereafter disappears from MCâs life for an extended period of time. In the end, MC is old and dies (?) and T eventually comes back to an empty attic. The feeling is one of regret and years lost, of unappreciation for the father-like figure that MC was for her all those years. She finds, however, the old papers at MCâs desk and ends up sitting and seeing the unfinished story there. She begins to write, and as she does, she rubs her own temples as she thinks hard. She is now and finally Teller, the teller of tales. Other details: I probably read this book sometime between the mid-2000s to maybe early 2010s after finding it in a public library. I think the cover was mostly red (but I could be completely off). The book seemed fairly old, but it could be just because it was a library book and used/worn.

Maybe read it around 2014 but i dont know when it was published. Dont remember the name of the book or the author. I remember at the beginning, this young woman is walking through woods in her town. She runs into this guy and they instantly have a connection/attraction. Later she goes to a new club that has opened in her town with a friend. The town is usually really boring so it's a big deal. When she walks in the club she looks up a long set of stairs and sees the same guy who she saw in the woods. Turns out he is the owner of the club. At some point the owner of the club offers her a job. She starts working in the upstairs VIP section where all the supernaturals hang out. She waits tables. Downstairs is where humans are allowed. The supernaturals never really go downstairs with the humans The owner of the club and the waitress fall in love.

goodreads	22887467	1	Nancy	2024-08-27T00:00:00Z	Sci-fi series w/alien warriors protecting vulnerable planets against insect-like opponents. The warriors are psychic, finding and training women who show signs of being psychically compatible to act as their partner/soul catchers. When they fight they bring cloned bodies of themselves, so if theyâre too badly wounded their female partner can psychically hold their essence long enough to place it in the new body, leaving the other body behind. They are physically beautiful, but they have a hideous yet effective battle form. Names Chaos, Legionâ¦ Some romantic pairing.

I also remember that these warriors live on a moon/asteroid/planetoid with all the housing, schools, communuities and amenities provided/supported by grateful alien races including humans. Girls with psychic potential are sent to be trained and tested. It's a huge honor to be chosen. The girls attend training schools and training classes. After the trainings are over, different warriors sit down with the girls and try out the mental connections they have with them.

goodreads	22887868	1	Cheyenne	2024-09-05T00:00:00Z	Read this book when I was in 7th grade in 2011/12 during our unit on poetry. I think the book had been out for a while, probably 90s or early 2000s maybe. It's a chapter book, not crazy short but definitely could be read in one sitting. I do not recall the cover art or anything. My teacher loved and met Maya Angelou during college, so we learned about her and also read this book. I thought it may have been by her, but so far I haven't found any of her books that match what I remember. I am pretty sure the main characters were all black children in sixth grade. Each had their own personalities and hardships that inspired their poems. When they read their poem to the class and gave their classmates a different look at them afterward. I only vaguely remember the plots of 2 girls from the book. One girl was super pretty, had green eyes and light brown hair. I think her name was Makayla, I could be mistaken. Her struggle was she was mixed and wasn't white enough nor black enough to feel like she fits in. Also, because she was pretty I think a lot of the boys harassed her, and the girls didn't want to be her friend. The other girl was bullied and made fun of her looks bc she was chubby. She tutored a little kindergarten boy on his school work. He asked her if she would marry him and when she asked why and it was because he thought she was beautiful. I've always remembered that scene. Thinking of it recently made me think of the book and want to find it.

goodreads	22887918	1	Elvis1404	2024-09-05T00:00:00Z	"Around 2070 some kind of """"Event"""" destroyed the Earth, turning it into islands (usually archipelagos of them, often representing pre-Event nations and/or cities) floating over a void covered by a layer of clouds. A couple of centuries later, the protagonists (at least a young man and woman, but they were part of a bigger group) live in a village on one of the floating islands, but the island's water (collected from the rain, I think) is ending because the rains lately are getting scarce; but then someone theorizes that all the world's water must have ended in the void, under the layer of clouds, where the atmospheric pressure is so high that no one has ever been to. During the books there are a few """"Flashbacks"""" of the world just before the event (notably, the first one is just at the start of the first book), always narrated from the perspective of a scientist woman character, used to clear a bit of the """"lore"""" behind the Event. The only clear part of the plot that I remember is (view spoiler) [ that (probably in the second book) the protagonists fly (with some kind of airship probably) to the flying pieces of what remains of London, to reach a secret laboratory where a nuclear powered prototype spaceship, capable of surviving enormous pressures, was getting built before the event. Here, they fight some kind of Mad-Max looking british punks and have to survive heavy radiations in the laboratory (the ship's reactor got damaged during the event centuries before); after this, they bring the ship to their home island to repair it and prepare to go into the void to find the disappeared world's water, but the book finishes here on a cliffhanger. (hide spoiler)] I am pretty sure this was a book series, and that I've read the first two books, I hope that a third book exists to end the story. I read those two books probably around 2014-2018, they looked like recent books (surely written after 1994 as the Eurotunnel between France and England was mentioned in the """"flashback"""" at the start of the first book). They were written in italian, but I'm pretty sure the author didn't have an italian name, he/she was probably European though since that's where (as far as I remember) the book takes place."	unusable			book series

She heads to the farm and finds out that it is owned by her ex-boyfriend from college. She lives there for a while, and gets to know his family and falls in love again with him and starts to grow fond of his family.

The MMC may have a brother who is her partner in hunting. One of the MMCs turns into a fox/kitsune that can produce heat(?)

From what I remember (although vague) A young girl/woman from an Indian tribe in north america has a rival tribe who calls her tribe cannibals. Is set hundreds of years ago and there may be a sequal. She escapes alone and goes north to canada and is taken in by another group of people and gets very home sick and keeps traveling possibly to greenland and marries a man who may be nordic? Any idea?? Thanks!

goodreads	22889163	1	Lauren Alyssa	2024-08-27T00:00:00Z	Okay so I just listened to this crazy podcast episode about someone whose ex best friend wrote a book about their friendship break up. They didnât name the book, but said it came out within the past year and was a fiction novel by Penguin House. That being said, they may be changing those details for anonymity so that may not be the publisher or year . Iâm desperately trying to figure out the book because I want to read it after listening to the podcast. General plot: two best friends who lived across the street from each other and grew up inseparable have a friendship break up when one of them doesnât ask her to be a bridesmaid after they had slowly been drifting apart. Thereâs apparently a major plot where the main character has a relationship with the friendâs brother during high school (sounds like there was maybe some non consensual or sketchy stuff with this but she didnât go into it). Thereâs also a couple chapters written in second person âtoâ the former best friend.	unusable			referencing a podcast

The MC is a young man, son of a duke or king I think, and he's nervous b/c he's old going to have a ceremony, might be a knighting. I remember there was a small test, his father swung his sword at his neck as he knighted him; if he had flinched, he would have failed. He didn't flinch, and was knighted. Then a wizard or something similar gave the young man a prophecy: he would never live to take his father's place. He leaves, believing he will die if he stays. He had traveling companions, at least one boy and a girl. At one point they come upon a village that was destroyed by a monster, I think it might have been an ogre. The ogre was immortal b/c it had hidden its soul, guarded by man-eating mermaids. The man was able to get the ogre's soul and destroy it, and kill the ogre, but I believe one of his companions died. Death rides up to him on his horse, and the knight says he's done running and is ready for Death. Death says he was never chasing him, and the prophecy never said he would die young; only that he wouldn't take his father's place. Fleeing as he did, he would never inherit his father's title. Death was grateful that the knight had taken care of the ogre for him, so he offered to tell him when he would really die. The knight declined, saying it had been a heavy enough burden the first time.

I THINK they used a car as the method of travel, because I remember them having to build up part of the road in the future to offset some erosion, so their car wouldn't appear in mid air or in the ground while moving times. The daughter is VERY flirty with him and uses the boy's attraction to her to manipulate him into doing what she needs him to do. After he returns to his own time, another version of that same scientist and daughter show up to ask him to help them put the events in time back in the correct place. This version of the girl is much more shy. I believe she is wearing glasses and has a pony tail while the """"flirty"""" version of the girl had contacts and had her hair down. He is really torn about helping, because he really liked the first version of the girl better, but eventually realizes she is morally wrong and ends up helping the shy version of the girl and ends up with her in the end of the book.

goodreads	22890527	1	Kelly Tew	2024-08-27T00:00:00Z	I thought I had read this story in one of the few short story anthologies on my shelf, but I've checked those again and again and it's not there. I'm pretty sure it was contemporary feminist literature. PLOT/SPOILERS: The story starts with a young girl hiding and the whole family/community thinks she's run away. She is trying to run away because she's going to be betrothed to a man who is an older adult, like 30's to 40's while she is only 8-10 years old. A neighbor woman finds the girl hiding in the basement, planning to run away, and sympathizes. The neighbor says she felt the same as a little girl and was going to run away but then realized (or maybe the girl had this thought?) that all the women she knew in life are wives. Women in their world/culture had no other function; no woman worked for wages. The betrothed man comes into the basement where the girl has been hiding. He is sensitive or scared or something, and he tells her he was worried she didn't like him. Whatever he says to her or however he says it softens her, and she returns to normal life. I think the girl has to stop going to school and stay home learning how to be a housewife. The mother has a line at one point where she says she was proud of her daughter because the spaghetti sauce was starting to boil and make a mess and the girl turned down the heat and stirred it, which was the right thing to do. This was said when the time came for the girl to actually be married and go live with the man. I want to say the story starts when she is 8 getting betrothed but she doesn't go to live with him til she's 10, but that may not be accurate. It may be that the father arranges the marriage and there is a party and only a few weeks/months between the engagement party and the wedding. The girl does marry the man, and at the end of the story she is a teenager, having been married for some years. She mentions that her husband has never made her have sex with him, although some men do that, and she talks about another girl from her class who was made pregnant at 13 by her husband. The story ends with the main character saying she is learning about business from her successful husband. She is allowed to sit in on a meeting, taking minutes or something. It's noted that this is unusual for their culture and somewhat progressive of her husband but maybe it's just because he loves her so much? It drives me crazy that I can't think of the name of the story or the book it appeared in, PLEASE HELP ME!

I'm pretty certain there were some form of the remains of stairs or stepping stones in the ruins, and somehow they caused her to travel to the past, back when the ruins were a building which I think was a boarding school. It may have been an all girls boarding school but I'm really not sure. I think there was a plague/epidemic at the school? Which eventually caused it to go into ruin. Again, these details I'm not too sure about. The MC met the principal of the school and she had her separate office. (I believe she was said to maybe be a stern kind of woman) I think she made friends with one of the girls? Whose name was possibly Flora? But maybe not. Maybe Flora was MC's buddy/guide or something like that for being new. At the end of the book the MC returns to present day. She was 11-14 years old. The following details I'm really not sure about but I think at the end Flora (?) / a guy MC possibly befriended (I'm not certain if the guy friend existed) ended up being her grandmother/grandfather when they were younger. Maybe, maybe, her grandparent (whichever one it was) is dead now? Her mom was also still alive and part of her life - I remember her existing. I'm not sure but I think maybe her mom/family had been worried about her because she'd randomly disappeared? I believe MC's clothes were wrong for that time and people commented on it. Maybe she had her phone with her which also raised questions

goodreads	22890675	1	Jenny Dean	2024-09-05T00:00:00Z	I read this book when I was in primary school so it canât have been published after 2012. It was about a young boy who was an orphan and got taken in by I think his elderly aunt or aunts. He had to go to theirs on the train by himself to get there and packed his computer in his case (he was obsessed with his computer). They pick him up from the station and take him to their house and itâs a huge old house. They have a group of elderly friends and have secret meetings downstairs. The boy sleeps in the attic and sneaks downstairs one night and listens at the door to hear what theyâre talking about but gets caught by one of the old men. It turns out that the old people are bank robbers who give the money they steal to charity/the community/fundraisers. The antagonist of the book is a man who drives a rolls royce, I remember that vividly and it might have been on the cover of the book. One of the friends is super smart and sets up a booby trap in the garden that the boy sees during the night when he sneaks out and he gets scared because he thinks itâs an animal with red eyes coming to get him. He also spends some of his time climbing and sitting in trees in the forest by a lake or river. Iâve been looking for this book for years and can vividly remember so much of it, even how I visualised it while reading but canât for the life of me remember the title or author. It was for older kids and the cover was a cartoonish drawing but professionally illustrated. Iâve searched all over google with no results. Iâm pretty sure it was set in Britain and I went to primary school in England, maybe it wasnât published elsewhere.

goodreads	22890744	1	Grace	2024-09-05T00:00:00Z	Hi all, Iâm very stuck to find a book I read in the mid 2010s. I picked up this book from the library in the same heap of â13 reasons whyâ so youâre getting the era of YA from that. The details in the title are all that I have, other than knowing the album I listened to whilst reading it. The only other detail is that he whittles and he chooses to be an âoutcastâ from society and the female protagonist is warned away from him. At the end itâs ambiguous if he has taken his own life, I believe she finds one of his whittled creations by a tree and itâs suggested that heâs drowned in quicksand. Would love anyone forever if they could help, itâs been so long searching!

Lead boy plays baseball but injured his arm and for some reason ends up coaching a girl's softball team (I believe). Lead girl has probably never played before and the boy is annoyed and frustrated. I don't remember the in between details, but they start dating somewhere near the end. I have a vague feeling that his name is more common like Brad, Ryan, or something, but can't be certain.

Then a bird who is supposed to represent death comes to âsaveâ him but is using him. When I read it, it had a yellow cover.

goodreads	22892395	2	SBC	2024-09-05T00:00:00Z	Hi Aimee, it sounds a bit scary! Was it a horror story? Or maybe science fiction or fantasy? You will need to add the genre to your thread title so the Mods don't lock your thread. Also, was the child who is the 'black sheep' character a human child? Were the other children all of the same species and, if so, were they animals, fantasy creatures, aliens, etc.?				
goodreads	22892395	3	Aimee Haslam	2024-09-05T00:00:00Z	Hi! Thanks for the help. Never posted in here before so didnât know about adding genre. How do I edit? Child was human and from what I can remember I think the other group he was playing with were elf like creatures. The ball game they played seemed similar to netball/basketball. Honestly Iâve tried ever Google search under the sun that I can think of to find and havenât come close but I remember reading it as a class so canât have been horror as I was only around 10 years old at the time! Iâd say maybe fantasy?

It happens a little ways into the book, but it's the mystery that the rest of the book is spent solving. And the blurb for the book mentions a murder. There's also a line about making wanton love in a bowl of wonton soup, to help them remember the definition of the word wanton, if that rings any bells.

She has the power of shadows that run veiny lines under her arms that almost incapacitates her with how painful it is. One time when she was young she killed her mom by accidentally pushing the shadows into her, it give the girl peace for a second but kills her mom. When she is older, they find a boy from the other side of the planet that can cancel out her power and give her peace. Heâs also the only one she can touch because she would accidentally hurt others by pushing the shadows into them but heâs immune. He starts off as a slave to her but they eventually become romantically involved. At the end of the book she is caught going against her nation so the brother publicly skins half her head and replaces it with silver skin as a lesson Other random info - they go on yearly voyages to follow the current around the universe each year where they also go to scavenge and loot other planets / the brother is also evil and was basically forced into being that way cause of his dad, the girl is also forced to hurt people as a means of getting information out of people / the father ends up dead at some point / the brother uses another boy whoâs power is to take and replace memories to the point that they become a connected person with both personalities / at some point the girl learns to put the shadows outside her skin so she can still use them to attack but they wonât hurt her anymore Year range - maybe 2020 - 2024?

I think the boy may have helped the doctor home after a trip to the bar. The doctor is old and may have a drinking problem. The doctor gets a job aboard a slave ship to help take care of the slaves. The boy gets branded by an enslaved man who is attempting to escape. The man is captured, and the boy is told/forced to brand the enslaved man in the face. On the ship, some of the enslaved people are brought to the top deck. When they see large pots, they begin shouting in fear. A shiphand explains to the boy that they are stupid and superstitious and think we are going to cook and eat them. A pregnant enslaved woman goes into labor. The doctor is passed out. The boy tries to deliver the baby. Sadly both mother and child pass. There is a line about the woman screaming and the blood under his fingernails. The boy is later disgusted by everyone's lack of empathy towards the woman and child. The enslaved people take over the ship with the boy's help but I don't remember what happens next. Thanks.

It was about a boy, who I think was a blacksmith's apprentice, and somehow or another he ends up going on a quest to do something with special stones (moonstone, bloodstone, etc) that are held by each race of creatures in the land. I think the point was to unite the races to defeat the bad guy. He meets a fey girl named Linwe, who travels with him, and a goblin (at least I think it's a goblin?) named Hnagi. I don't remember the main character's name. I know there were also some tall, creepy Ringwraith-type creatures hunting him too.

I read this book in 2021 and I think it was published by a female author in early 2010s. It started with a girl who had moved into a neighborhood and got to know her neighbor/the main character (the buff and burley, rough around the edges brother). I think 2 of the brothers and one of their sons + dog was living in one house. They helped her move in and get settled, helped when she got scared in the middle of the night. Someone broke her window or something, so I think this is what led to them spending the night together for the first time? At the end of the book they had a big cookout. Maybe it was a BBQ competition? The next book was about her friend (maybe?) who was getting to know one of the other brothers. I donât remember much from this book, but I think he was a martial arts teacher or did something with troubled kids. I donated these books to the thrift store before I updated my goodreads, and now I want to read them again. Of course I donât remember the title or authors. Help please!

And the girl was made fun of because I think she used a big safety pin that was used for her baby brothers nappy (diaper) She ended up having a party for the class as well in her back yard but she soon realised she doesnât care about the popular girls or being poplar. She ended up being friends with I think three boys. Who the class would consider unpopular and trouble. But she had an actual friendship with them. Her teacher was female and told her about the slings and arrows quote. I remember a specific part in the book where they had to write about a genie giving them three wishes. But the wishes have to backfire. Her friend who struggles in school didnât quite get it so he wrote things like âI wished for a car but it backfiredâ.

Someone gave me this book to read around 2015-18, and I am a bit confused about this now. It would mean the world to me to find out what the title/author is. I marked details that I'm unsure about with (?). 1. Genre: Fiction (I believe I read it in Dutch) Plot details: A father (who's a professor?!) suspects that his daughter (student) posts adult content online. He sees things online that remind him of her but he can't believe this could be true. He is also suspicious of her spending (?!). Through the plot, you learn that he is not mistaken, and that her boyfriend helps her to produce content and that she makes a lot of money this way. I don't remember how or if she is found out, but there is some rupture. She moves away, and becomes highly successful (becoming a consultant?!) in the US (Los Angeles, California?!). The plot details that in the end, she is married, has a beautiful house, but shocks with some additional details that she also still works in the adult movie industry. I read the rules and hope I didn't miss anything. If so, I apologize. Again, your help would mean a lot to me.

It was set during what I believe was the cultural revolution in China, for sure in the past and the main character was a boy probably around 12. He was orphaned and fending for himself on the street and later on he joins a street gang that was just children. *SPOILER INCOMING* I am pretty sure that one of the boys in his gang ended up dying.

The boy gets emotional because his nanny was a big part of his life, and he doesn't want her to leave, so he locks himself in a room, and somehow, the gift transports him to a new world. Once he is transported to the fantasy world from the modern world, he opens his eyes, and the boy is in the middle of a forest alone with only the things he has in his pockets.

I think it was one of those teen mystery type books - possibly a teen spy thing or âfantasy element meets the real worldâ or some other such but thatâs just my assumption from the vague âsecret organisationâ bits I do remember. The fact that the girls dad isnât in the picture was significant somehow, I think he had some kind of connection to whatever the mystery was and had disappeared as a result, and the mums unwillingness to talk about (or inability to remember) what happened to him was a big part of why the daughter had a bit of a fraught relationship with her. The only bit I for sure remember is the drugged doughnut on the park bench, delivered by a nice businessman type with a briefcase. I donât think that that was even a particularly large part of the overall plot, more of a last minute explainer for something, and I donât remember anything else about it unfortunately or what the main plot was... Itâs very likely I picked it up in my middle school library, if that helps give an indication of what type of book it could be. Iâm reasonably sure that the book was set in the UK -

goodreads	22902076	1	Charlotte Mccash	2024-09-05T00:00:00Z	Hi all! Looking for a series of childrenâs books I read around 2003 or 2004 when I was in third or fourth grade. The main character lives in some sort of futuristic fantasy world, and in one of the books she and her family teleport through a teleportation station, which kind of seemed like an airport or train station. In that same book I believe there was another girl who had telekinetic powers. I believe characters in this world (or at least girls) developed magic powers when they reached a certain age. I believe the main characterâs powers could have related to something like flowers, butterflies, or crystals. These were the sort of things that would show up around her on the covers. On the covers she had beautiful curly auburn hair, wore dresses, and likely some kind of flower crown. The covers were overwhelmingly beautiful to me as a child. Think about an elementary girlâs dream aesthetic. All of the books were also printed with unique purple text on white paper. She probably had a pretty flowery name, although I canât guarantee that.	unusable			series

The paper inside was thicker non-gloss paper that you would usually find in older books. Each story was illustrated but I believe by different artists. Some of the artwork was very creepy where some witches were as pale and glowing as ghosts. The artwork reminds me of the 60's- 80's art style. Stories included were the Brave little tailor ( he had spectacles in his pictures), a story about a glass mountain, a story about a little girl and boy ( the boy is turned into a fawn by a cursed stream, the girl gets married to the king, but her evil step mother and stepsister who only has one eye suffacate her to death in a hot room and place the sister in her place, but she comes back), there is also a story about a brother and sister running from a witch in the woods the witch is flying on her broom and the little girl throws down a hankerchief and it turns into water and in the end the witch dies in a torns. I'm sorry for carrying on, I cant remember the date of the book or when it was printed and I have been looking for 20 years.

goodreads	22903605	1	Sarika Singh	2024-09-05T00:00:00Z	The Genre is Childrenâs Fiction. The book is about a Hispanic family. I think they might have been from Mexico, but Iâm not sure of their exact ethnicity. They are new immigrants to America and they are trying to fit in. The protagonist is a girl named Pilar. She is embarrassed by her name and changes it to Polly so she can fit in better at her American school. There is one scene in the book that really stood out for me. Pilarâs father visits her school. At the school, Pilarâs teacher makes fun of him because he is very short. The family is very embarrassed by this incident, which represents the discrimination that Hispanics face in the US. By the end of the book, Pilar comes to respect her heritage. The title of the book might have been âCall Me Pilarâ or âCall Me Pollyâ. Truthfully, I canât remember the title or the author. The book was set in the 1980s in America. I read the book around 1988-1990.

goodreads	22903685	1	SBC	2024-09-05T00:00:00Z	I read this book last week at a holiday home I'd hired (in New Zealand) and now I can't remember the title or author. It was a small, short picture book, probably for children, and I thought it was called something about friends or friendship, but I might be wrong about that. There were minimal words (maybe one sentence) per double page spread, with a photograph of an animal on the left side and a baby on the right (or vice versa), each in the same pose/position. e.g. a lion sprawled out and a baby sprawled out the same way, a bunny's teeth and a baby's teeth. It was not unlike The Blue Day Book: A Lesson in Cheering Yourself Up but this one seemed for a younger audience and had fewer words. From what I remember, the author was a European woman (photographer) who might have had several other books along the same lines. I would appreciate any help figuring it out!

I would have read it before 2012 for sure, in the late 2000s (probably somewhere between 2007-2011). I think my mom borrowed it for me from the library at the school she worked at, so I don't have it. I have a feeling that it may have been one of the Pain and the Great One books by Judy Blume, but I only remember one specific detail, so I would not be able to identify the book myself. I think it was a very simple chapter book, possibly illustrated. I remember that one of the characters mentioned their little brother only eating white foods. It was something along the lines of, """"this was before he got into his white food phase..."""" and I think it was an older sister saying this. Unfortunately I would not recognise the book based on anything else, as I already suspect it might be the Pain and the Great One but am not sure... if anyone remembers the white food line from a book, please let me know! :)"

She doesn't remember much about the front cover other than the fact that it was probably blue and maybe had a ship on the front. She says it's one of those books that switches perspectives in each chapter - and she thinks there's either four or five main characters that it alternates between. Two of the characters fall in love with each other, and she thinks one of the characters wants to be a nurse. Another one is a private in the army who she thinks was really arrogant and he either has a made-up girlfriend that he writes letters to, or he makes stuff up to write about to his girlfriend. She's pretty sure it's set during a war as well, and most if not all of the characters end up on this massive ship that ends up sinking. Another thing she remembers is that at some point, one of the characters has to cross an iced over lake with a girl that's blind and she ends up falling into the water and dying.

It would have been a single book rather than a series. The character is a young girl who goes to stay with a family member (aunt?) and ends up riding a horse into the wilderness, where they get lost, I think due to a thunderstorm? The girl falls and I *think* injures her leg, but the horse stays near her, eventually helping her stand and get back home. Itâs possible it was a wild horse that comes up to her, but Iâm not sure. I have vague recollections of the horse being a paint, but Iâm could be mistaken.

I believe it was kind of a straight laced girl and rebellious boy, maybe he had gotten in trouble and had to work at the shelter as community service or something. But this really massive flood comes and they end up going into the flood waters. I don't remember why. They get on a boat and I think someone tries to kill them in one of the houses, like they're trying to save someone or get something and people are there robbing the house. I think the guy or one of their dads had an old pickup truck. I know for sure there's the animal shelter and the flood. I feel like the title was just one or two words and pretty generic.

goodreads	22912818	1	Bethany Ainsworth	2024-10-05T00:00:00Z	I read it a few years ago. It had a prologue about a wife and husband who moved into a small town. The town hated a witch who lived in the woods nearby, but the witch was very friendly and invited the couple for dinner. The wife went many times and grew to like her, but the husband wanted to fit into the town, so she had to break the friendship between her and the witch. Because of this the wife's baby was cursed to have visions when looking into reflections. Then the actual book starts, the baby now older, and is shunned by most of the town because of her visions. But then she has a vision of a boy lost in the witch's woods, so she goes into the woods to save him. She finds him being helped by a witch. Then she trys to question the witch but (and I remember this exactly) almost gets trapped in a fire circle but the witch saves her. I remember that the witch's house was invisible unless you circled around a willow tree a few times. The Girl also had a crush on this guy from town who pretends to like her back, because he thought that the girl was with the witch, and he wanted to capture the witch to show the town how cool he is. The girl meets with the witch every few days to help train her to control her powers, (there's a whole thing with a door in her head that she should never open?), but eventually she convinces the town to hold a trial for the witch to show that she really is innocent. (I think it takes place around 1700s-1800s), but the girl has a vision of her town being destroyed. (view spoiler) [The book ends with the girl opening the dood in her mind and getting killed? trapped? The witch tries to save her but is to late. The witch makes her a very cool glass coffin at the wedding/funeral. (hide spoiler)] TLDR: Psycic girl meets witch who trains her, gets betrayed by her boyfriend, defends the witch, (view spoiler) [and dies at the end. (hide spoiler)]

She says it was fairly new at the time, but at least two books in the series were already out, so probably before 2015. First book reads like realistic fiction and then at some point the girl discovers something about herself - like she can turn back time or has a magic twin are examples but not actually it. Then in the second book she finds others like herself. The book series titles were connected in some way - followed a pattern like sharing a a prefix (un- or dis-?) or root word (time or clock?) or suffix (-less?). Covers are a black background and show a caucasian girl with brown hair. She is the only picture on the cover. Text is white. Books are relatively short - 200-300 pages. Books were found in a (typical to conservative) high school library. We already know it is NOT: The Lynburn Legacy (titles Unspoken, Untold, Unmade) Unwanted (sequel Hunted) Unwind Dystology Clockwise Series (Clockwise, Clockwiser, Like Clockwork, Counter Clockwise) my daughter says these covers are closest to what she remembers Thanks for the help!	unusable			series

One of the reviewers mentions something about California splitting off after a tsunami, though it is induced by nuclear war, not an earthquake. Dates from the early 1980s and runs to 29 (or more) books. Supposedly adult, but many reviewers mention reading it aged about 12, so could be regarded as YA / teen.

goodreads	22921673	1	Rebecca	2024-09-27T00:00:00Z	Contemporary romance that I read years ago. in the opening chapters, mmc and fmc are attending the same party/event. mmc has the flu and is on some cough meds that makes him a bit delirious. He is looking for his girlfriend, sees the back of fmc and mistakes her for his girlfriend. Ends up kissing her in greeting then promptly either throws up or sneezes into her face. A few days later fmc ends up getting sick thus missing a job interview. She somehow gets in contact with mmc and berates him for getting her sick and making her lose out on a job. As an apology he offers her a job to take care of his dog. He travels for work and since him and his girlfriend broke up he needs a new caretaker. Fmc moves in to take care of the dog. While mmc is away they start getting closer while talking on the phone. I also vaguely remember an intimate scene between them involving purple lipstickð¶ï¸ð¶ï¸ I remember also reading the second book in the series that was stand alone about fmc best friend. In the opening chapters she is about to get married. After the ceremony during the reception the whole wedding hears the groom cheating on his new bride because some audio was being captured in the room he was in. She is devastated and embarrassed. She somehow gets into a relationship with the mmc best friend or brother. She confides with him that her sex life with her ex husband was not what she wanted. He would make her shower before hand and would not perform oral for her and she always had to take care of herself afterward. So they go in this sexual awakening together where they use her entire suitcase of unused toys to figure out what she likes.	unusable

My brother was born in 1966 and he remembers (he thinks) that he had a book- likely a picture book- when he was very young- 1970 or before- that featured a blue car named Gabriel. He named the family car (this was well before I was born and he doesn't remember the exact type of car- but it was some kind of late 1950s or early 1960s Chevy with tailfins) after this book character. He doesn't remember if the car was anthropomorphic or if it belonged to someone in the book- though I told him to take a guess and he says probably it was anthropomorphic. He doesn't remember any other characters or any plot points. I know this is likely going to be super hard to track down, but thanks for any help anyone can give!

I read this book back in the 2010âs, but this was probably written in early 200âs or even earlier. I recall that the cover of the book had a girl sleeping/laying dead and the book started off with a prologue/intro very eerily about death and had a very complex language. The characters were mostly young/teenage people and most likely set in an Asian setting, most likely China or Japan. Book was about evil spirits and ghosts and combined life and death. Book was creepy but had a âfeminineâ touch to it, if that makes sense. The title/book cover had the word dream and was purple/black. The book involved a high-school/small college.

I mean, props to the author for having used the unreliable narrator in a trashy YA book in the 90s way before it became a trend to use it in adult mainstream novels, but as far as I remember it was annoying and not at all well done. (hide spoiler)] In Crash Course, only the one person dies, as far as I remember, and the main character wasn't what I'd call an outcast. They're not really a group of friends, either -- the students are all on a trip for SAT prep, so they didn't necessarily have much to do with each other before the trip. I never read Nightmare Inn, surprisingly, but it's currently available on Kindle Unlimited if you have access to that.	solved	Class Trip	475331	by Bebe Faas Rice

goodreads	22940161	1	Jmegan	2024-10-27T00:00:00Z	This is so silly, I read it just a few weeks ago, and I've already forgotten the title! The story is about a group of former classmates who reunite for a wedding. It's two of the classmates who are getting married - they were a couple when they were in school, then they both married other people, divorced, and found each other again. There's some urgency to the wedding because she's dying of cancer. His adult daughter doesn't like her at first, and they're disappointed that she's not coming to the wedding, but of course she turns up just as they're about to walk down the aisle. Multiple perspectives - the story is told in both present-day and flashbacks, from the POV of each of the classmates. The wedding takes place at a hotel which is owned by one of the former classmates. She's the widow of a famous poet, and it comes out over the course of the story that he was cheating on her. One of the other classmates never married, because she has been having an affair with a (married) professor all this time; she still teaches at the school they all attended. One of them is rich and obnoxious, and married to an ice queen who doesn't fit in at the beginning but turns out to be on the side of the former classmates by the end. Several of the former classmates were on the baseball team together; one of them was good enough that he might have played in the major leagues, but he died right after graduation. Lots of unpacking of this in the present day parts of the story. One of them brings his husband to the wedding; lots of unpacking of this as well. And in case there weren't enough tropes here, there's also a big snowstorm that keeps them inside longer than they expected. Obviously I have a good recollection of the story, but the title and author have completely escaped me!

goodreads	22951303	1	Jessie	2024-11-05T00:00:00Z	This is a children's picture book about a boy who gets a cat for his birthday. He goes downstairs on the morning of his birthday and unwraps all the paraphernalia he'll need for a cat. After breakfast (which I want to say was pancakes), they go to an animal shelter so he can pick out his cat. I don't remember if the plot goes any further than that. I want to say I remember in the pictures that he is drawn with a red wind-breaker like jacket (collar, no hood), and blue jeans. Both his parents are present and he is an only child. I would have read this in the mid 90s, but I remember thinking that the book looked older, so maybe from the 70s or 80s? TIA!

The bizarre thing I remember is that one of the main characters, a girl, had to cut her braids off. The kids spent time swimming and canoeing and this one girl never combed out her braids. Her hair became mildewed ( I think ) and they had to cut it off.Not much info but I have often thought about this book.				seems a bit racist

goodreads	22952337	1	Lucy	2024-11-27T00:00:00Z	I probably read this book between 2019-2021 but it was likely published somewhere between 2011-2016. The book starts out with a young girl whoâs mother is an undocumented immigrant who had crossed the border from Mexico to the United States and found work on a farm (Iâm almost certain it was a strawberry farm) and this work caused her back problems. The young girl befriended the twin sons of the owner of the farm, they were rich and popular meanwhile at school she was picked on because she had I think bedbugs or lice on her clothes. Her mother was somewhat cruel to her and said that she had the eyes of the devil because during her journey across the border her husband had been killed and she had been sexually asssulted resulting in the child. When the sons of the farm owner graduate high school they throw a party and during this party the girl sleeps with one of them and soon after one of the boys dies (I canât remember how) and she then discovers sheâs pregnant. The boy that she had slept with marries her and I think they have a daughter, shortly after she leaves town (I canât remember why again but I think she may have been depressed). Then the book focuses on when she returns to town and she is trying to gain her husbands trust again and spend time with her daughter and build a better relationship with her mother. If anybody can help me find this book I would be incredibly grateful, Iâve looked through my kindle history but I just canât seem to find the right book and itâs driving me insane. Many thanks.

goodreads	22959043	7	Alan	2024-12-05T00:00:00Z	Solved. Probably. The book is most likely Knight's Fee , by Rosemary Sutcliff. The book fits most of the particulars - a dirt-poor orphan MC, taken in as a servant (squire) to a knight. In this role, he is a backup to another boy, the knight's grandson and heir. They initially got along well, before the MC stole something from the older boy, who then knocked him down in a fight. The one detail I thought I remembered turned out to be incorrect - the older boy was called Bevis, not Phillip. They were both vassals of Sir Philip de Braose, however. I am not certain about this book, mainly because I remember nothing beyond what I listed above. Nothing in the rest of the book seemed familiar. However, the close resemblance to the little I remember makes it very likely this is it.	confirmed			
goodreads	22959043	1	Alan	2024-12-05T00:00:00Z	Back again, with yet another one: Age group: children, probably age 9-12 Genre: historical (certainly), medieval (probably - see below). Date: 1960s to 1980s (read it late 80s / very early 90s). Origin: unknown, but most likely British. Plot details (so far as I can remember): Book is probably set in the medieval period. Story begins with MC, a boy aged about 8-12, about to go into service to the household of some local magnate (knight, landlord, or some such). He is doing so because he is either an orphan or his parents are too desperately poor to keep him. Upon joining the household as a servant, a slightly older servant boy called Phillip is given the job of training him. Phillip bullies him until the MC hits him. Phillip is taller and has a longer reach and knocks the MC down. Later in the story, the boys have to make common cause (there is some threat to their employer, or their home) and become friends. Other than that, I remember very little. The MC may have had a name that I (reading this aged 10-12 myself) thought of as odd / atypical for a boy - maybe Norman or Anglo Saxon. Progress so far: Not great. Had a look through some medieval fiction lists, but didn't see anything immediately obvious. Given that the only name I can remember is of a sidekick, who is unlikely to be mentioned in the back cover blurb, this is going to be difficult. I had a look through the works of Cynthia Harnett but didn't see any possibilities. Open Library being down for a few weeks limited searching for a while. One book that did look a chance was Master Cornhill by Eloise Jarvis McGraw . Set in London in 1665/66, it features an 11yo homeless orphan called Michael as MC. Among other adventures, he attaches himself to the household of a cartographer. There was a even a potential antagonist called Phillip, but he was actually the employer's grandson, and much older than 12 (view spoiler) [(and he never actually appeared) (hide spoiler)] . The most useful outcome of this was that I realized that the story I am looking for is not guaranteed to be medieval: it would be easy for me to mistake 1665 (the wake of the plague of London) for the Black Death (I was a bit vague on historical eras when I was about 10). It is certainly pre-modern, however. As always, thanks in advance for any help.

goodreads	22960931	1	Emma	2024-12-05T00:00:00Z	There is some spoilers in this post. I have tried google but failed to find this book. I'm hoping the topic is ok, as the things I remember could count as spoilers. I read this book when I was about 13 around 2001. It was from school I read a paperback copy it was probably for a slightly older audience but I would read anything and assume it was fine for me. It may have been cream or other light colour and it had wheels or circles on the front and/or gold squiggles, possibly a picture of a woman or couple on the front. The title might have had one or more of the words; time, wheel, season or something like that in. The main character was an older teenager, she lived with her family it was set in the past. It was possibly a taven but unsure. There was something at the beginning about her hair she had to wash it in the river or get the water from the river maybe she had lots of long hair. Really unsure if I made this bit up but she falls in the river escaping someone or some attackers. She ends up lost and get captured and possibly gets taken by boat to a port city where she is sold as a servant/slave situation, there is another male slave too. I think she is sometimes allowed out the house for errands the male slave isn't. I think the person who bought her isn't horrible but they still want to go home. The two escape and journey home. He ends up injured and she tends to him, when he is better he is really grossed out when he finds out she used period rags to dress his wounds. They end up falling in love and when they make it to his family home it turns out he's a noble or really rich, maybe even a Prince. She's pregnant. But she hates living with his family and feels like she doesn't fit in so runs away to have the baby (i think it's before the baby is born, now I'm writting it down maybe he didnt know?). In the end she's in a little house and he comes and finds her. I always thought of this book as having some fantasy elements in but I think it might just be my memory of the front cover and title and the taven olde worlde feel which is a bit embarrassing.

goodreads	22961468	1	Emily	2024-12-05T00:00:00Z	I read this book earlier this year, but I'm struggling to find it now... The story is about a girl who's still in education, and she meets a boy who is new to her school. They start to hang out and he reveals that he's actually an alien from Mars who was sent here along with his family. He then reveals that she's also a Martian too. She later on discovers that her parents were the King and Queen on Mars who died, and now she's next in succession and is the long-lost Princess who has become Queen. I think she was sent to earth to protect her... She has to get used to being a Martian, whilst also becoming Queen of a whole planet and trying to stay safe away from those people who want to kill her whilst also coming to terms with her feelings for the guy she met, who turns out to be her bonded/mate (whatever it's called in the novel). Any help in finding this book would be great and greatly appreciated, thanks :)

I believe the author might have been young (?) and the curing of the boy wasn't a main plot point, but it's the thing that stood out the most to me. I believe the boy's name was Elias or Elliot or Elijah maybe? It seemed a bit old-fashioned. The illness in question was, I think, implied to be HIV, but I could be way off. The (female, teenage) protagonist gets turned into a vampire and decides to go and cure him with a sort of DIY blood transfusion, IIRC. It happens near the end of the book? Possibly? They're not friends, I don't think, but she cares about him for some reason. I genuinely don't remember most of the book.

Ebook Read between 5/10 years ago, could be older in hard copy (I donât remember tech) Set in London(?) in the 1990ish? MFC is from a wealthy family (possibly noble), but had inheritance tax issues when the grandfather died. The mother was trying to sort it out when she died in a car crash. The double inheritance tax issue left the estate finished. The team/gov in charge of the estate agreed to sell it as is to a rich rocker who wanted everything in place, so MFC had no choice but to leave with nothing. As a privileged girl, she had no skills, so she started in event planning (parties). Eventually she had a well known business. MMC grew up poor and built a huge business. Wanted to marry into nobility/wealthy circles to show he made it. His bride was a poor/ex-wealthy one who wanted to marry money. The bride built this ridiculous wedding saga, and then ran out just before to marry her poor love. While sorting out the non refundable wedding bits, they give into their attractionâ¦ loose touch, missed messages, secret baby. MFC is hired to manage a charity function at her old estate. The MMC arrives back to find out his new home has been loaned out to a charity event, and the event planner is pregnant and he thinks she preparing to marry the baby daddy. She thinks he knows the baby is his, but chooses not to acknowledge it. Thanks âºï¸

The main character has a lying problem, and tells her best friends family about what she wishes her life was like. At one point the father breaks the brother's arm and at another point her mom's nose. He gets them presents after. At the end, the mother kicks the father out, and the last scene with the dad, the main character brings him a coffee maker. There is a book in the main street series by ann m martin that is similar, but this is different.

My memory is pretty murky on the story and hasn't been improved by the hunting through other books I've been doing, but I feel like the protagonist (teen girl, that I'm sure of) lives in a town where everyone loses their memory every so often. It may have to do with rain but I'm not at all sure about that bit. She doesn't lose hers for some reason, and I feel like she has to hide that, and then (view spoiler) [discovers a way (in a cave?) for her to keep the whole town safe from the memory loss. (hide spoiler)] The feel of the book is definitely futuristic, but I wouldn't say entirely dystopian necessarily - there's not much sense of the wider world that I remember, but people in this town live a decent life. Any help narrowing this down would be greatly appreciated!

goodreads	22973000	1	Mysterosity	2024-12-05T00:00:00Z	Looking for a YA book I read sometime between 2010-2020. I believe it was set during modern times. I remember the basic plot of this book but little else. It's about a teen boy and his younger brother (9-12ish) (brotherâs name was something weird, ratchet or something) who live with their neglectful (abusive?) father who is an alcoholic/drug addict who canât hold down a job. he boy is responsible for taking care of his little brother. He meets a girl whose father is a pastor or somehow in charge of a church and sheâs part of the church chorus but has a bad voice. The main boy is chilling in the church because itâs a safe place and he witnesses her running out after messing up a solo and goes out to comfort her. They end up together and the romance storyline is pretty typical for a YA book. In the end the boy and his brother almost die in an accident that might have been a car accident maybe? Their father may have intentionally driven the car into something or maybe even off a cliff of some kind or it might have been completely accidental. The little brother manages to escape and goes to the girl for help. They think the main boy is dead but he somehow survives. The father either ends up dead or just leaves at the end. The little brother was socially awkward and good with like inventions and making things out of junk or something? He also is described as having a perpetual cold. I think it's an alternating perspectives thing between the boy and girl but then in the end its the brother too. There are interludes where the narrator describes the backstory of the parents and brother, including the death of their mother, after which their dad went off the deep end. The family had to move around a lot and at the beginning of the book they have just moved into town.

goodreads	22973449	1	Sophie	2024-12-27T00:00:00Z	I must have read this book once in the last 5 years. So this girl is kicked out with her family in the middle of the night by this billionaire who (kind of??) owns the town. She was in her nightdress and he has a spark of interest which he ignores. A few years later she returns to the town stronger and with her own business to prove that she was different from her family. She falls in love with said billionaire - his mum and sister are against the match. Sister burns her house down with them both in it (intending to only kill her) and waits outside with a gun to finish the job if she escapes. She sees the error of her ways and then apologises. A few other things that may help: She sees him make love to another woman in french (before they all got kicked out) and this stuck with her. She doesn't open a bank account in her home town as he may have control. She cut off contact with her family when she left. I think she had a younger sibling that she took care of but I'm not too sure. I don't think this was in a modern setting as no smartphones etc are mentioned. A library to search for information is mentioned. I hope this is all helpful. Thank you!

The main character is a male animal (I'm assuming a bird, as they were relatively small and could fly) and they, and their commune (? it was like a neighborhood of them) were inside of this testing box. The main character had conflict with another one of the male animals, who I think was stronger than him. The main character was one of those characters who aren't very strong but are smart. He realizes that they're being tested on by scientists (I'm pretty sure humans, but not 100% sure) and wants to leave the box/zoo-like (but much smaller than a zoo) place they're in. Lots of the other animals don't want to leave, as their lives are pretty much perfect for them. They don't need to hunt for food or water, and are taken care of. The main character gathers a group of people who want to escape, and they go through a somewhat treacherous journey to get out. Once they get out, the outside world is VERY dangerous. I don't remember the specifics anymore, but there was a war with another species (either another species of birds or a whole other species) and also traps set by humans. Lots of his friends died. I think there was also a plot point regarding his dad, and another regarding the sun (or maybe he just flew into the sun at the end). But I remember a lot of animals ended up dying from either the fight or the traps set by humans. Some general facts: - Fiction - Unsure specific age demographic, as there was a lot of death, but I'd guess older teens - Action - Was definitely a book that was published more recently, as in at least after 2010 (my guess) - May have been part of a series. If it was, I most likely did not read the other books in the series. (but not 100% sure) Please let me know if you find anything similar, even if it doesn't fit all of the requirements.

Heroine hears a lot about H's previous relationship with an older married woman from his relatives at the time of marriage. They all hated that woman who was from the same town/island/village where the Hero had grown up. The OW was actually an abused wife and was not evil as the family thinks. Hero helped her escape and is now happily married. But he doesn't explain this to the heroine till the end. She is suspicious and actually goes to meet her. Hero explains everything, buys her a dream house and grovels in the end.

Hero was very young at that time (early twenties). They lived together for some time before the breakup. And H's family blames the married Ex for this heartbreak and cast the Ex as villain in front of heroine. The married Ex was getting abused by her husband, the hero helped her and they had relationship. All this happened in small island , so it was a big scandal. Though hero was not really in love with Ex, he made big deal in front of heroine and later regretted it. In last chapter heroine finds out that the hero has gone to meet the Ex. She goes there to confront him..She finds out that the Ex is now married and hero is helping the couple in business..no personal involvement. The book might have been written by Lynne Graham as the plot line and the writing was similar to her usual style. But I am not 100% sure.

goodreads	22978022	1	Grace	2025-01-05T00:00:00Z	A series, I think with 4 books in it. Read it in around 2020 with all the books already out, and they were probably more recently released. The city is an entire island, shaped in a circle, with class divisions going in rings (outer ring is the poorest class, center-most circle is the royalty). Giant wall around the city and I remember it being pretty isolated. Only girls in the outer ring have magic, and they go to a school where they're trained for it. Using the magic is physically difficult, causes nose bleeds and dizziness. I'm pretty sure the MC has a brother who works in the factory section and a younger sister who she doesn't want to have magic but actually does. Once the girls go to school they get sent away and are never seen from again. Spoilers ahead and warning for human trafficking: Once the girls graduate, they get auctioned off to the nobles and royals, where their job is to carry the nobles' and royals' pregnancies and essentially genetically modify the babies. Main character gets bought by a duchess I'm pretty sure, and I think the person sold to the queen gets killed by the queen. MC escapes. Love interest is a boy who I'm pretty sure was sold to essentially a brothel (I remember sex trafficking of boys being a parallel to what happens with the girls) (I think they might have met in the duchess' house and escaped together). After the MC escapes, she gets to an isolated cabin where she finds a woman who also has magic. It turns out that the reason magic is so difficult is because the way it's taught is against its nature, and it should actually be used more to manipulate elements and is rooted in the islands history. Series proceeds to destroy the ways dividing the city.	unusable			series

Some of the bios had a photo of the actor. Hardback, and had photo of Clint Eastwood on the cover, which I think had a lot of blue in it

What I remember are brief paragraphs about the western actors, followed by lists of their westerns. One actor that I know was included was George Montgomery, who isn't featured in this book. And it was a hardback with a picture of Clint Eastwood on the cover, with much blue sky in the image âºï¸

I want to say """"Tinkersmith"""" but I searched that up and it seems to not have the same image I have in my head. - The story was for younger kids, I'd say around 10-13? Plot: - The girl was in a house working for a rich family, and was discovering/searching a secret ---> I think the butler or maid was helping her out? And some people were against her ----> There might've been something about a rock in a garden or a park. Emphasis on the garden or park, as I'm pretty sure that was important. And I think she was led there by the butler. - I think one of the boys was an inventor or liked inventing or tinkering with things - There was a sentient robot involved that helped the three of them ----> The robot most likely died or broke down by the end of the story - One or two of the three main characters ends up leaving by boat at the end of the story - There was something important regarding a clock. It might've been in the title, but I'm not sure Cover Details: - I remember it was green, but slightly on the grey-ish or brown-ish side.

goodreads	22979035	1	Georgia	2025-01-05T00:00:00Z	One specific plot point I remember is that at the beginning of the story the protagonist is being forced to do a bully's homework (don't recall why exactly), and the bully's handwriting is so bad that he asks his little sister to write it out for him so it will look more like the bully wrote it, but his sister refuses and tells their mom that he's trying to get her to do his homework for him, so he resorts to writing it with his left (non-dominant) hand. Possibly the homework also gets lost and is one of the things he finds in the manor? Read around 2008/2009. I had a couple of Paul Jennings collections (almost definitely Uncanny, Unreal, and Unbelievable), but I've checked all the short stories listed there and I can't find this particular one - it's possible this isn't his at all, but it certainly fits right in and I don't have any other ideas as to where it might be from.

The story starts with a male protagonist in a mental institution, but it's later revealed that he's actually trapped in a virtual reality world created by his company. The antagonist, one of his coworkers, has trapped him there as part of a scheme to take over the company and use the VR technology to simulate market behavior. In the VR world, time moves faster than in the real worldâwhat feels like years inside is only days or weeks outside. The virtual environment is incomplete, and the protagonist begins to realize something is wrong when he digs a hole and finds nothing underneath it, just a blank space where the system hasnât filled in the details. The VR system connects people through a dream-like state, with participants lying in beds to access it. Thereâs also a scene set in a virtual version of Japan. The protagonist was married at one point, which is mentioned as part of his backstory. The book is set in a near-future Earth, with no mystical or supernatural elementsâjust advanced technology.

It's about an overweight, insecure boy who comes from a broken home and has an absent, drug-addicted mother. He moves to the beach town (I think to stay with distant relatives) and eventually comes up with an idea to start his own business washing cars as they travel over the town's car ferry, which gives him his own income and lets him come out of his shell to the town's other kids, including to a girl he has a crush on. SPOILERS AHEAD: At the start of the novel is a mysterious teaser of an unknown woman getting an overnight bus to some destination. I believe this is then occasionally flashed to during parts of the main plot as she makes her way somewhere.

The boy and girl start meeting under the cover of night and slowly fall in love, but without knowing their true identities. In reality, they are both tasked to go after one another for their respective sovereigns. There is a chase scene somewhere (perhaps to her room in the palace?). Some details: - she leaves a scroll in his jacket in one of their meetings, perhaps it was a clue for him (?) but I think it led to him trying to return it to her in the day, which was dangerous. - his jacket is somehow important in her finding out his identity (maybe it was the smell) - he was considered the cowardly and bookish prince, but in reality he wants to stay away from his family's corruption - the girl hates who he is in real life because she thinks he helps raid her people's towns with his brother. - the girl is her queen's favorite, believes her queen wants the best for her but learns that the queen isn't as loving as she once though - the book may be part of a series - the world building is beautiful and the writing is vivid!

The book is about a boy and a girl who are best friends, really close. The illustrations were black and white, rough sketches, so I'm assuming it was written in the 80s, 90s, or possibly the early 2000s. I read it a couple of years ago, probably as a third grader or younger. Anyways, the boy and girl are best friends and it starts to get dark as they talk about letting each other keep their belongings if one of them were to go missing/die. I think the boy mentioned something about getting kidnapped by a troll (ogre or something similar.) and letting the girl keep his stamp collection. The boy is shown tied up. The troll part could've been hypothetical since they're kids and don't know trolls aren't real. The girl says something about breaking her arm and the """"bone sticking through the elbow.""""

goodreads	22988875	1	Kt	2024-12-27T00:00:00Z	*Spoilers Ahead* This is part of a series (and I may be mixing the books together) but basically an alien in search of female's to save his species. He crash lands on earth behind a ladys home in the woods (somewhere in the north west I think). The reason he is surching for females is because there was a virus created by their enemy (another race of aliens) that killed off 90% of their females (and very few are born and survive or no females have been born since the attack, just males). The alien is hurt and the woman overcomes her fear and the language barrier to keep the alien hidden till his ship is fixed. Once it was he steels her away to his world. He is a prince (I believe) and their people spend most the year on their own living a nomadic life style in tents and riding giant (6 legged horses). They also come together to live in a castle (great hall?) during the harsh winters. There is also something like a right of passage where the go alone as an adolescent to a cave to learn what their calling in life should be (ie. warriors, healers, etc.). I believe book 2 is where a healer from the alien race is fated for one of the woman they pick up (which is illegal for heelers of their society as they only want the strong to mate?). Please help me remember this book series!? It was so good! I believe I started reading the series in 2020.	unusable

It was written by a male author who I believe to be American or Canadian. An eccentric family lives in an abandoned church in the American midwest. Father is strange acting as I remember. Son might be involved in UFOs? The author also had a collection of short stories that I read at about the same time. In the collection, there is a story about a dinner party or cocktail party for some upper class/urban professionals. One of the men at the party has just returned from living with a primitive tribe in South American or the Amazon. It is revealed that he partook in a native rite and pierced his genitals much to the shock of his fellow party guests.

I *know* I read this in the 90's, and I think it was an anthology, but I've checked all the David Cohen and Nancy Roberts books with no leads, so I have nothing to go on other than really faulty memory. There's a girl visiting a hotel with her parents, and she befriends another little girl who's staying there. There's a scene with the two girls playing tag and running into the dining room, only for the main girl to be told no one entered before her/there's no other kids staying. There's also a scene where she wakes in the middle of the night (maybe multiple times) and the ghost girl in standing at the foot of the bed watching her. They finally find the ghost girl's remains buried in the room's walls, with a note pinned to her by her mother, explaining she died of an illness and the mother panicked and entombed her. If anyone has any leads, it'd be much appreciated. This story has--no joke--HAUNTED me for at least twenty years!				anthology

Somebody owned a dog, but it wasn't the mc. I think the characters were in middle school. I only read one book in the series, but it was the second or third.

I had it on my laptop and IPAD but canât find it now and cannot remember the title. I did look at her website but cannot find any information regarding this. Or even what universe she may have set the plot in. It is about a college student who is the last female descendant of a magical family that has been in a debt obligation for years with another magical family, I am not sure if only females were called to answer the obligation. I also donât remember what caused that family to be in a debt they must always answer when they are called to help. Her mother was called years ago but is too old now so the daughter must go instead. she travels to the other family where she must assist the head male member of that family in a dangerous r race in order to win against another family of evil people to claim rights. the area for the race has been dangerously booby trapped and changed physically to a very decrepit area. The race will be televised and there will be judges. I believe the MMCâS brother died and the MMC got some affliction where magical bugs or insects appear and can kill him. His magical power is much greater than hers but she is obligated to protect him during the race. . I believe his sister was married to one of the male members of the evil family and she has children. Her ex husband is very involved in this and IS TRYING to get the children. her brother is determined to protect his niece and nephew at all costs. The FMC discusses ending her family.s obligation with the head male, he may be open to it but she STATES THAT THIS will finally end now She says she will never get married nor will ever have CHILDREN AND THAT WILL finally end her familyâs debt obligation. they are to search for a flag or something to claim in order to win. During the story, they manage to kill some of the EVIL cheating members from the other team. Near the end of the story The mmc gets injured and collapses. THE FMC sees the prize and has to climb a very unsafe shifting pile of debris. She retrieves the prize which wins the race. she ends up saving the MMCâS life AND SHE DRAGS HIM OUT OF THE AREA. He has feelings for her and visits her at college at end of story thank you.	unusable			short story published in book

It was one of the most charming books I've read and it's driving me crazy wanting to find it to read to my kids! Children's picture book: Boy and girl with same name meet at school, where they both think the desk (labeled with their name) is theirs. They become really good friends and do everything together. I think they lived in a mountain town. Eventually one moves away and I think wrote a letter to the other to explain and give contact info, but it went lost. The friend moved far away (maybe to Africa?) and had amazing experiences but was always thinking of his or her friend. Years later, that character comes back to town during the town annual summer celebration. They were both chasing fireflies and ran into each other, and immediately reconnected and rekindled their friendship. I vaguely remember something about them either having a secret language or just a few words that meant something special to them, but I'm not sure about that. It's been so long!

goodreads	22993342	1	Mira	2025-01-05T00:00:00Z	Read this between 2008-2011, in a junior high library, so the book was for teens. The story was about a prince who was sent to retrieve a magical fruit for his kingdom. I think the fruit was a peach, or a nectarine? It specifically had to be transported in a chest of ice. It was in a similar style to Lloyd Alexander's The Iron Ring, and it was in a vaguely Middle Eastern setting. I'm pretty sure the main plot of the book was the difficulties the prince went through to bring back the fruit, but it may have just been a sideplot that I happened to remember clearly.	unusable			series

Things start to change when the narrator discovers a room that has technology no longer used and more specifically a lightbulb.

A 12-year-old girl wakes up the morning of her 12 birthday with other 12-year-olds, also the morning of their birthdays, and sees that they all have a circle on their forehead. (a plain, smooth, outline of a circle) They are in a plain, square room and cannot seem to find a way out. Eventually all the kids manage to escape the room and start wandering around the building where they are being held. I want to say that they thought all the hallways were going uphill, but I could be wrong. This group eventually runs into another group of kids- also there on their birthday. The MC sees that this group also has the circle, but it's textured (I think it had little points all over it) The two groups join up to try to escape where they are being held and find a square room that is filled with rainforest. They meet up with two more groups of kids, also with the circles of different types. The details are a bit fuzzy to me at this point, but I think there were """"creatures"""" in the rainforest room, and all the kids figure out they are in a spaceship of some type.

goodreads	22995272	1	Sarah	2025-01-27T00:00:00Z	Pretty sure I read this in the â90s. Absolute latest it would have been would be early â00s. At the start of the story, the female protagonist, who is quite young and naÃ¯ve, is meeting up with a man she barely knows in order to lose her virginity. I have a feeling her friend was also involved and arranged it so that they could both lose their virginities; I might be wrong about that. Anyway, she meets the man, or they do if Iâm right about the friend being involved. and is surprised that heâs brought another woman along. During sex, something goes horribly wrong and the other woman dies. The man pressures the protagonist into helping him bury the body and keep it secret. He then uses this knowledge to blackmail her repeatedly over many years. When she finally gains enough courage to stand up to him, he convinces her that she actually killed the woman and blocked the knowledge out, so now heâs blackmailing her not just on having helped to hide a death and bury a body illegally but on what she now believes is murder. I was skimming through the book in the library, so there were large parts I didnât read. One thing I remember is that the protagonist makes friends with a pregnant single girl (this part of the book was set in maybe the â60s) and her father disapproves. The girl is determined to raise her baby as a single mother, and does so successfully. She has a boy and calls him Pepper after the Sergeant Pepper album (OK, must have been the 60s); sheâs quite a hippie type. She witnesses the scene on one of the occasions when the blackmailer turns up and threatens the protagonist; I think she was sharing a house with the protagonist at this point and I remember her calling a house meeting to protest about what had happened; the protagonist couldnât tell her about the blackmail so couldnât explain why sheâd let the man treat them that way without standing up to him. Thereâs also a later scene where the protagonist starts researching the woman who got killed and finding out who she was and more about her background. She almost gets caught as a result. The protagonist marries a man whoâs a survival expert. As I recall, they meet when they both happen to be at a bar with the TV on showing a news item about some people who died in the wilderness, and he starts talking about what bad decisions those people made and what would have worked better for them. Anyway, she gets together with him. The denouement: The protagonist finally confesses to her husband about the other womanâs death and about the blackmail. He gets more details from her and she mentions that she remembers the woman calling the man âGarrettâ even though that wasnât his name. Her husband realises that the woman was actually saying âGarroteâ and asking the man for autoerotic asphyxiation and she died when this went wrong. The protagonist realises, finally, that it was her blackmailer who killed the woman by accident and that heâs blamed her for it both to keep her quiet and to blackmail her. There is then some kind of confrontation scene which happens in deep snow in a forest (I forget why). While chasing after her, he gets caught somehow and starts screaming for help. Because of what her survivalist husband has taught her, she realises that whatâs happened is that he stumbled into a snow trap; what looked like snow over level ground was actually a layer of snow caught in the tops of trees in a much lower valley, and heâs stumbled into it and is drowning in the snow. Thereâs a line about âThe horror of itâ as she pictures how it must feel for him. She stands there and shouts the full name of the woman who died. She knows the man has drowned in the snow, and she herself manages, with some difficulty, to escape from the deep forest. Thereâs an epilogue in which sheâs thinking back to everything that happened and feeling satisfied that the last words he heard were her telling him the name of the woman that died.

It is about women (I believe there were children too) who were imprisoned but not in a barracks type of concentration camp. I believe they were being held by Japanese soldiers and in a jungle setting. They lived in houses that were just box-like structures with dirt floors. There were a few of these houses that lined a dirt road and at the end of the road, there was a pile of bodies. The book is about how the women adapted to daily life and survived on no or little food while being tortured. I do remember one part of the book described how when the main character moved into this structure that was flooded, had to be creative to try to make it livable. I believe they only had a small piece of cardboard (or it could have been carpet/blanket) that became a treasure to them which would sometimes be stolen by other women. At the end of their âroadâ where the bodies were, there was an area of torture/hangings. This book was very sad and did not use euphemisms at all. It was a true story. I did take it out of our Universityâs library and have checked their online catalogue but the results are very limited because Iâve lost my student ID and sign-in credentials. I also cannot physically visit the library. I read this book somewhere between 2012-2017 (I believe it was 2015/2016) in English. The title may be brief, one or two words but please donât let that narrow your results because I may be incorrect. Thank You so much!

It read like a fiction book but Iâm positive it was a true story. The title was short, no description after one word, perhaps two. Oddly enough I kept this book on a chest and every time I look at that chest the feeling of it comes back to me all these years later. What I can recall is it was not typical âbarrackâ type concentration camp set up. (This is why I feel they were not Germans and I do recall having the sense that it was the first realization there were other soldiers to fear) ) They were put it a crude type of homes that lined a dirt road. They were just really crude board structures with wood floors. Many women to a âhouseâ. There was a pipe of those that died at the end of this âroadâ. It wasnât a large area at all. Also they hung people by the pile of bodies. I remember there being a small piece of cardboard or perhaps a mat that was their prized possession and someone had to always be guarding it so it wasnât stolen by the other women.

goodreads	22998830	1	Candi T	2025-01-05T00:00:00Z	I know the book is later than 2010. Single mom of a young son (I think he's 10-12 year old range and staying with his dad over the summer through most of the book) is at her sons baseball game and sees a man on a nearby baseball diamond waiting to play (he's not professional, just on a local team). He becomes instantly attracted and pursues her but she is reticent. I think he is younger than her and may be a veterinarian. She is an author and still lives in the nice house she and her ex-husband shared. Her best friend talks her into getting her feet wet by trying to date again. Her ex is controlling and keeps showing up. At the end, her new man and her relatives are celebrating a holiday there when the jealous ex shows up making a scene.

goodreads	22998874	1	Ruriko	2025-01-05T00:00:00Z	The book is in English. The book cover was a photo-realistic image of a girl (I think she had black hair) with the mountain which she travelled up behind her. I read this book roughly 13 years ago so it would have been the early 2010s. The setting wasnât modern, I vaguely remember the protagonist using a dagger or sword to defend herself on the mountain. Spoilers ahead: I remember that she travelled up the mountain and when she was seeking shelter in a cave, she re-unites with a male friend who unfortunately later dies. There is a prophecy about a girl with either white or red hair (canât remember the color) conquering the mountain or saving the people. The protagonist (female) has black hair. However, I vividly remember that at the end of the book, her hair color becomes the same as the one stated in prophecy due to the light reflected by the snowy mountain. I apologise in advance for not being able to provide more information. It has been so long and I really donât remember much other than really liking the book! Any help is much appreciated. Thank you!!

goodreads	22999558	1	Dora	2025-01-27T00:00:00Z	I'm sorry - all the details are fuzzy now, but I hope I've recalled enough for someone to go on! GENRE AND PLOT DETAILS I think the wife was dying of cancer, and only has a few months left to live. She and her husband adore each other. She loves him so much that she doesn't want him to end up alone after she's gone, so she secretly plans and starts putting things in place to get him set up with a new partner(s) before she passes. I think they may have had a dog, and owned a house? I also vaguely recall there were perhaps flowers (daisies?) on the cover of the book? YEAR I READ THE BOOK Perhaps between 2010-2018 or so? I would so love to find this book because it was such a tear jerker. I feel like I read Me Before You by Jojo Moyes soon after this book, hoping for the same kind of story.				
goodreads	22999558	2	Kat	2025-01-27T00:00:00Z	If you think you'd recognize it from the title/author, here are some lists of books that involve the death of a spouse. https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/... https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/1... https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/... Did the wife die during the book? If so, was it at the beginning or the end (i.e., was the book about the relationship between the two as they anticipate her death, or about the husband moving on after her death)? What genre would you say the book was? How young is young? 20s, 30s? Or just young as in younger than someone would typically anticipate dying?				
goodreads	22999558	3	Dora	2025-01-27T00:00:00Z	Thanks! Looked through all three lists and some looked like possible matches but no match yet. The wife is alive in most of the book, and I think she dies at the very end. They were anticipating her death. I'd say it is realistic fiction, drama. I feel like they were in their late 20s to 30s - newly married, I think, with no children yet.

She realizes she is mother nature/the embodiment of the seasons (like a seasonal version of the Crone/Mother/Maiden) and in forgetting herself she led to unending droughts and an especially bad winter (hence her haggard appearance). In remembering she joyfully races across the land with flowers growing in her steps and trees blooming and fruiting, ending her run in fields of grain swaying in the breeze. Over the course of her run she brought spring and summer back and shed her cloak and decrepit looks. I think she reflects the seasons or people's belief? Because she had flowers falling from her hair in spring and golden wheat trailing from it in summer/fall. Even the new winter was healthier by the end, serving it's purpose as a transition and rest period, not a harsh punishment killing life.

He fell through iirc an ordinary puddle on a street (chasing a newspaper?? someone was reading a newspaper??) and ended up in this classic fantasy land, living in a medieval-type castle. I think he was either mistaken for the crown prince there or had to work for the crown prince; there was another boy who was an antagonist, and a girl protagonist who helped him. There was some work to do with a pigsty, and at some stage the protag boy discovered possibly an evil wizard using a powerful hourglass to do... something to the kingdom. At some stage the boy and girl have to break back into the castle with the help of a troupe of travelling, talking, acrobat animals who can scale the walls. Someone also ends up swinging on a chandelier. This was definitely a series, so some details may be from the later books.

They were doing a radioshow together (about dating advice) and one of their favourite fans (an older woman, who had gotten a lot of romantic advice on the show) gifted them a stay at her ''love cabin'' while she was out of town - I think she was going on a trip with a new boo. I also think its was the hometown of the male lead, but am not sure i remember it right.

I believe it was a newer release at the time, and I think it was the first in a trilogy. I donât think the 3 books were with the same MCs, but rather each book had different MCs. So like the title says, it was an adult romance. I'd consider it contemporary except for the curse. The FMC was normal with no magical powers and the """"world"""" was just our modern world. The MMC was stuck in a cursed object - i think it was a mirror or painting, but honestly could have been anything. The FMC accidentally releases him from the curse. MMC has been stuck in the curse for centuries - he was either a knight or a warrior. After she releases him, she takes him out in public multiple times.

The story starts with a man in a swimming pool, supposedly an astronaut going through a rebalancing of his body after coming back from space. The Astronaut is accompanied by 3 women who stay with him in the pool and tend to his needs. The book then changes to the story of 3 women, one an American who is a well known athlete who loses it and gets kicked out of the sport that she loves and then is recruited by the FBI or CIA. The 2nd woman is Japanese, and her life drastically changes that she ends up working for the Yakuza. The 3rd woman is Russian and her life drastically changes that she gets involved with the KGB. The story bounces back and forth between the 3 women and the astronaut. Loved this book when I first read it. I especially loved how the 3 women go from a place of weakness to one of strength. This book has been haunting me for years.

goodreads	23005848	1	Simon Wells	2025-01-27T00:00:00Z	Hi, I wonder if anyone can help with identifying this book? I read it at least 20 years ago, and can remember the plot, but not the name or the author. It must be obscure because I cant find any clues online. ChatGBT seems to understand what Iâm talking about. It says the book is called âThe Torcâ but Iâm not convinced, as there is a book by that name but it is not the correct story. It also gives varying results regarding the author. (AI has a long way to go before it becomes reliable) Anyway, this story is about a female writer who moves to the Suffolk (possibly Norfolk) coast in the UK, to get inspiration for her new book. It is winter, so the weather is bleak. She walks on the dunes by the sea, and discovers a Torc in the sand. She takes it with her and as the story unfolds, she begins to experience paranormal activity in the house. It becomes apparent that the torc is tied to a story about a Roman soldier who was murdered, and a womanâs ghost who begins haunting the writer. The writer has visions of the ghostâs story, and starts to uncover the truth about the soldierâs murder. When she finally solves the soldierâs murder, the haunting stops and the ghosts are at rest. Itâs a long shot, but does anyone know this book? Can anyone confirm the title or author? Thank you, Simon.

A snake was wrapped around her thigh. The story is from Eve's perspective with the Snake as her guardian appointed by God. The Snake is to teach Eve how to be a human while God teaches Adam in a separate area of the Garden. Start's when they are both children. After they become adults God attempts to get Adam and Eve together but she prefers the company of the snake and the Snake does not agree with how God treats both her and Adam. God attempts to make Eve lay beneath Adam to 'copulate' but she has no interest and the snake takes her away when Adam hurts her.

When the book starts its when sheâs at an airport (Going for a audition- She gets it and that how she becomes famous) she meets main guy from rock band, they chat for a bit. Then it skips to current time - Her and her bff start a band. She sings (maybe plays guitar too) - bff is the drummer. Then they meet the guys from famous rock band again (He remembers her) they collab. She and main guy from band start dating. Thatâs the basics of what I remember.

It was a white book with a removable white cover (kinda plastic-y material). The book was written so you would / could read a story for each day in a month (up to 31 days). Some stories were in 2 parts (so 1st part on one day and 2nd part on the next day). Stories included fairy tales like Rumplestiltskin. I think was a decent size, both in thickness and width/length.

goodreads	23009464	1	Nadine Keels	2025-02-05T00:00:00Z	Hello! I'm looking for a middle grade series or related books I read back in the early or mid-1990s. As I recall, both boys and girls are main characters in the series, and I think they're all students at the same elementary or middle school. (But it isn't one of those long series where the characters basically stay the same age for 30 to 200 books, like The Boxcar Children or The Baby-Sitters Club. ð ) In the one story I remember the most from the series, one of the characters, a plus-sized girl, has lost weight. But she also has womanly curves already, and after a makeover, she looks older than her age, which is probably twelve. She meets a teenage boy who doesn't know how young she is, and he wants to hang out with her. (view spoiler) [When she does hang out with the teenage boy one day, she shows him around someplace or to some activity in her town or neighborhood, but he isn't really that enthused. Then she takes him up to her favorite tree house or something, and he approves, commenting on the privacy of the spot. She doesn't really know what he's getting at until he starts trying to make out with her, and she panics, finally confessing that she's only twelve, or whatever her younger age is. He's surprised, put off, and he cuts their date short, leaving her there by herself. (hide spoiler)] The series' book covers had images of the characters: illustrations, I think, but with a realistic style. (Not a cartoonish look.) If I recall correctly, the particular book I remember about the curvy girl shows her on the cover after her makeover, with her possibly blond hair in a trendy short cut, and she's wearing lipstick, either magenta or red. Maybe she's wearing a green sweater? She's looking over her shoulder at a smiling teenage boy right behind her, who appears to have stopped her to talk to her. It isn't a children's fantasy series, or wacky like the Wayside School books. I guess you could call the series pretty upbeat realistic fiction. Any ideas about the title or author? Or the names of '80s or '90s middle grade series with kids handling realistic situations? Thanks!	unusable			looking for a book series / multiple books

As the series progresses he becomes an archeologist? And starts uncovering some secret that might cause? Or end?? A war thatâs happening in the kingdom. But because heâs away from his mother who is a water spirit user he starts to develop his ability to talk with his spirits. Turns out his mother was the lover of a previous emperor? And sheâs used her water spirit to suppress his ability to access the spirits he was born with. And through that he learns that he is the rightful heir to the kingdom and the series ends with him having a child with his lover. (I keep thinking of the name Gaius but I might be imagining that) Other major character includes The main characters lover. Who even though sheâs a nomad and the nomads donât have the ability to call the spirits she gains the ability because of her sleeping with the main character. A diplomat?? Lady with a wind spirit?? An Uncle?? of the main character general/captain guy with a fire spirit?? Those characters end up in a relationship. And itâs a fairly spicy one.

Switches character perspective and has time jumps. A woman has gone missing and her colleagues are very upset and wondering where she has disappeared too. Changes perspective of the colleagues and you learn a little about their lives leading to wonder which if any are involved for example a man keeps getting mass texts while at work, lady from HR knowing too much about peopleâs lives, a woman hates her colleague and believes sheâs faking her life. They all go to the pub to try and bond in their grief. The HR lady also arranges work team bonding activities. The time jumps are to a young girl who is blamed for the things her sister does and is bullied by her. I think it may be called something like girl/woman missing or woman/girl missing which gives a lot of google results. Will add spoilers below. (view spoiler) [ the young girl kills her family by house fire and steals her twins identity, she goes to live with her aunt who she eventually pushes off a hill on a hike. She sees the lookalike of her sister at work and abducts her. She also sees a woman on her run and kidnaps her too. She is organising a birthday party for them to celebrate in her delusion. They work together to escape. The team bonding activity at work ends up being rock climbing and a man falls after his ropes are tampered with. A woman runs away after she is accused and then followed by her colleague. The 2 women escape and the person who did it sets fire to her house. (hide spoiler)]

She is a mix of the the tree people and scratchers. Her dad was a tree person and her mom was a scratcher but also one of the healers. Something happens I canât remember how but her mom dies and the scratcher group scatters as she was supposed to take over as âhealerâ. The l male scratchers need healing from the healer every month (maybe I canât remember how often) or they get violent.i believe they harness the sun to do so. The women just get depressed. She ends up getting a dog companion as it wanders its way to her. Heâs a German shepherd. The tree peoples dogs âchooseâ them and bond with their soul. Thereâs also a side story happening where a guy I think he represents death is destroying the forest because he takes the Pelts of other animals and joins them with himself. It creates a sickness through the land. I vaguely remember them being called skin stealers or something similar. This group of people eventually sets fire to the forest to drive the tree people out because death wants to take over the world. Which leads the tree people and scratchers to join up and find new land. Thereâs also different people groups that bond with different things. Like a man bonded with a lynx and in the third book people bonded with horses. Itâs a three book series but I remember a fourth book being written during the time and those people bonded with wales. One the books covers depicts I do believe a cat of some sort and fire.

Here's what I can remember of the plot: A girl gets interested in the disappearance or death (can't remember which) of a girl who went to her school, and I believe had the same teacher as she did, from about ten years ago. Somehow, she finds her diary, and starts to get closer to unveiling the truth. I believe the killer was either that girl's mom's boyfriend or her own stepfather. The book had a creepy, woodsy vibe for sure and if my memory serves me right, one of the character's names was Rebecca/Rachel/Jess/Sarah. I think. Thank you for your help!

goodreads	23012700	1	Margaret Benny	2025-01-27T00:00:00Z	First in trilogy. In post-apocalyptic world, people live in a vast underground city carved into rock. There are homes, businesses, and even a transportation system within the cavern. Above ground, the world is devastated, and remnants of the old world exist, including a ruined unnamed Library of Congress. There is a murder that the two main female characters investigate. Their stories run parallel then intertwine: Charlotte Mehan: A seamstress and Sgt. Lara Calladine: A police officer who investigates crimes within the underground city. Found the characters' names and setting using Gemini AI but its suggested book titles and author were not correct. Read the in early 2000s (2000-2010). Thanks in advance.	unusable			AI used
goodreads	23012700	2	Genesistrine	2025-01-27T00:00:00Z	Why do you believe the AI about the character names and setting when it got the rest wrong? What do you yourself actually remember?	unusable			
goodreads	23012700	3	Margaret Benny	2025-01-27T00:00:00Z	"Thank you for replying and being interested. I remembered that the first main character was a seamstress/laundress named Charlotte. I also remembered that the second main character, a female police officer was investigating the murder and she was later made a lieutenant in the second book, all of which AI Gemini agreed with. The AI had the setting right as well, which included the characters living in an underground city post Apocalypse and above nearby was a destroyed unnamed library which was meant to be the Library of Congress. I remember that the police officer's handsome new partner was a brand new officer who had been an actor. Part of the police are dirty. Also, the seamstress Charlotte has a nonromantic male roommate and also becomes involved with the murder when she goes to the victim's home for her work, She starts investigating with a civil servant with criminal ties, but he is honorable to her. The cave they live in is massive and there is even a train /trolley system to get around. There is a wealthy area of town (where the murder occurred). They carve their massive homes out of the rock and they have rooms like regular houses and they typically are below the rich houses above that they no longer use. The second book in the series has characters go above ground where some people still live and work post-Apocalypse growing food. Technology is basically gone. In summary, I believe AI Gemini is wrong about its suggested names for the author (Kristin Kathryn Rusch writing as Kristine Grayson) and the series (her Beneath series: """"Utterly Charming"""", """"Absolutely Captivating"""", """"Irresistibly Charming"""", etc). They're just wrong for this murder mystery. The author and her pseudonyms do not write these types of mysteries, she writes romances. I went down her entire list of books under her name and pseudonyms. Further, the series that AI Gemini reported as the correct series is a romance series based on fairy tales (Cinderella/Prince Charming, etc.). Definitely not the series I remember. AI Gemini was good, and did better than other search engines I used, but it was not perfect."	unusable

She plays guitar and sings and that's like the one thing that makes her happy. She has a gig playing at a venue which is where she meets the male vampire who recognizes her power which she uses to control the mood of the crowd while performing. The vampire saves her and turns her into a vampire and helps her learn to control her power. He's a tech genius and very wealthy and the top vampire in the region. I think the story takes place in Texas. I think there's some kind of special vampire amulet that she ends up touching and becoming like queen of the vampires by the end of the book and there are vampires fighting over this amulet.

These beings possess a rich culture but are divided into at least two rival states engaged in continuous warfare. The narrative follows a human family that crash-lands on this unfamiliar planet. In the chaos of their arrival, a girl becomes separated from the rest of the family members and end up unknowingly infiltrating different factions of the conflicting states. Both parts of the family assist their newfound allies to make black powder canons. Wolf-like beings live in collective groups (that are called individuals), communicating and sharing thoughts through ultrasonic sounds. This unique method of communication allows the members of the pack to synchronize their thoughts and ideas, creating a hive mind. This creates a unique culture where groups too near each other will hear each other's thoughts. With the human space ship, mold like thing end up in the planet. I read the beginning of this book in 2008-2015. I did read Finnish translation, so I may not use right terms for local inhabitants. Book was not new.

goodreads	23013226	1	Amanda Costello	2025-02-05T00:00:00Z	Iâm looking for a series of thriller/action books about a teen girl that I read in the late 90s. There were at least 10 in the series; likely 20. The main character, a teen girl, did not have supernatural powers, but she was especially strong/fast/smart. She might have been trained or been genetically engineered to be this way, similar to the Bianca St. Ives character from the 2017 Karen Robards Guardian trilogy (adult fiction). There was a lot of action and suspenseful moments in the book: chases on the NYC subway, sneaking out of her brownstone, scary bad guys (some were low-level criminals in the city, and I think some were government agent types). She had an unhappy home life with a mean (but not abusive) stepmother or other female guardian. Her dad or father figure wasnât involved much. I think people were after the teen girl as a larger part of the series plot, and that she solved smaller mysteries in each book, but my memory of the plot is hazy. The paperback covers were eye-catching, each with a mostly white background and some shiny/hologram aspects. I think the girlâs profile was on the first one and then covers after that were more abstract. I think she had really long blonde hair. Each book in the series was similarly named, maybe with âdisappearanceâ in one of the titles. I read this series before the Fingerprints and Roswell series by Melinda Metz, and based on that, I think the 1998/1999 timeline of publication/peak popularity is correct. I think the series was by Alloy Entertainment, but I searched and came to a dead end so I could be wrong. Were Alloy books associated with Deliaâs catalog back in the day? I want to say there was some sort of connection, but it might just be part of the late 90s setting in my memory. I think she developed a love interest with a really good guy in the first book, and it was a mostly friends thing until later in the series. While this series wasnât as memorable to me as the Fingerprints and Roswell series (I reread the latter as an adult on my Kindle and it holds up! Plus, there was the TV show.), I do recall enjoying the action immensely. Hoping someone can help. Thanks!	unusable			series

Spoiler (ish) -The book starts with her as a child at a church or youth camp of sorts and one of the camp councillors tries to rape her so she stabs him in the leg with a pen. -She goes to prom in a suit and dances with another girl, the repercussions of this (because at this point the rumours of her being gay are running quite rampant) is a teacher tearing them apart, accusing her of trying to force a gay agenda and taking her to the biology (?) class where her parents basically have to come get her and help her out of the situation.

In it the hero a guy meets with an exiled sorceress from the flying city. I believe she was usurped by her sorceress sister and tries to fight to take it back. I remember she eventually allies with lizardfolk (sexy times in this book) and together they take back the city but the lizards betray her and free some kinda demon from inside the city and start to attack. I had this book something like 15 20 years ago I think. I want to see if it was actually good lol.

""""Fost Longstrider's mission seemed ordinary. He'd been hired to deliver a jug to a wizard on the far side of the forest. Unfortunately the jug contained a sex-starved genie, the wizard was dead by foul means, and Fost was probably the next to die. Then the genie was stolen and spirited away to the City in the Sky. It was up to Fost to steal it back from two beautiful sisters. They were fighting to become queen and, using dark powers, one had called forth a demon. Now Fost's foray was suddenly a terrible war... Now the Princess Moriana has to ally herself with the alien lizard creatures, the Fallen Ones. But their price is the sending of a human volunteer on a Quest that may well be a sacrifice - the seizure of the fabled, death-guarded black diamond called the Heart. And so it happens that mankind's most terrible enemy, the Demon of the Dark Ones, released from a ten-thousand-year bondage, is let loose to rampage and devour across the planet... Princess Moriana plans to raise an army in Medurium and wage war against the Fallen Ones who have captured the Sky City, but the inhabitants of Medurium appear interested only in the pursuit of sensual pleasures...

Her friend sees some guys by the bar and bets her a pair of shoes that she wont hit on the guy. MC goes up to them and tells them about the bet to get the shoes. Eventually when the friend comes over the friend recognizes the guy as a famous rockstar. They talk for a bit and he invites them to his concert.

What I remember about it is that it follows a family eating dinner and the mother will not give any of them dessert until all of their dinner and vegetables are eaten. The children and father do not like the dinner and/or vegetables so the father lifts a floor board and dumps everyoneâs food under there while the mother is making dessert. The mother notices they are all their food and is very happy. This happens for a while until one day when they slide the food down there the floor starts to rumble I think and then it explodes, exposing what they had been doing.

It was about a group of teenagers, the protagonist was a female. She went to a school and it did have one magical class but it did not focus on magic. You were only chosen to be in that class if you had powers and she didn't at that time. Her mom passed when she was young - it was when the world had an earthquake and it swallowed up a bunch of people but you later found out that this was when the world split apart from the magical world and it became two different realms. They go on to discover different magical items - she finds the spectacles of knowledge in her grandfathers library but they only work for her one friend - I think the name is Max, but I am not sure. She later finds a pen that turns into a sword for another friend and I believe a ring that when you wear it makes you stronger but drains your life force. She discovers a shop that you have to pay with your aura to enter the magical world. Later she gets a letter or something like that, that lets her travel between worlds.

goodreads	23016787	1	Kit	2025-02-05T00:00:00Z	read this book in elementary school around 2013 or so. I think it was a similar vibe to pendragon/spiderwick in which children are pulled into a magical world of adventures, I think a forest near where they live in the real world. Most action is. in a forest. Mostly remember two specific scenes. Young boy and girl (cousins maybe?) are lost in these magical woods near their home. At one point, they encounter a group that feeds them and welcomes them, as long as they wear animal masks. Protagonist wears a blue jay one, eventually realizes that it is fusing to his face, and at midnight will be permanently stuck (scared the shit out of me as a child!) Also, I believe main journey is attempt to find the emperor/wizard and have him fix the problem they are tasked with when pulled into this magical realm (maybe this is how they get home? don't remember). Spoiler below! They get to the palace and a man shackled to the room is singing a song. Talk to the monarch guy and realize that actually the bard is the emperor, and his song has been spelling the word 'help me' if you read the first letter of each line going down. The mask scene in particular is so specific, but noone ive talked to/googling can help me place it! Thanks :)

I think it's 2 boys, a girl and possibly a bully type character that goes? There's this creepy clown that is haunting the theme park and they become trapped inside. Along the way, they meet this ghost girl called Milly who helps them escape eventually. The plot twist turns out that the ghost girl is the sister of the main characters mum who went missing many years ago. This book is a KIDS book.

There was some sort of quest involving the central character, who was a woman named (I think) Fatima, who was very feisty and brave, and also beautiful. She went into the underworld where she met a djinn and possibly they became lovers - but it wasnât romantasy, it was more humorous in tone. There was also some sort of crack force of women known as the Luscious Doves, who were warriors but also irresistible to their victims.

First of all, I read this book anywhere from 4-6 years ago. It's one in a series, but just the first one will get me what I want. It's set in modern London. The main character is a part of a group that searches for objects that have collected 'bad energy' in them because of the trauma they were exposed to when in someone's possession. The main character is from the East End, his dad is some sort of thug. Main character's surname is 'Dominici' and he's called 'Dom'. He's shorter, stocky, and prone to fights. Dom's boss is secretive but generally well liked by the group. His sister disappeared some years back. He's got a fancy manor house. He secretly eats all the custard creams but claims to hate them. His name MIGHT be 'Richard'. The group go on the hunt for these 'cursed' items with weird, bad energy connected to them. It's possible for these items to be used as a destructive kind-of bomb. Dom has some special power to know if something is 'dirty'. In this world, America seems to have some sort of serious issue with people like Dom. I can't remember directly. Dom meets some government agent and they bang/date. I THINK Dom is convinced this guy is like... after him or something. SPOILER - In the most recent book I read of the series, Dom and his boss fake their deaths. Some magic mojo happens and Dom is like 'bro I'm the chosen one' or something. - At some point Dom is kidnapped by some weird doctor/scientist who wants to do tests on people like him.	solved / confirmed	Twisted Pretty Things	26888809	Solved by the OP

I used to read a picture book in the early 2000's about the background stories of animals on Noah's Ark. These animals were gathered around, sharing what their lives were like before the flood. There was a story about how a kingfisher got its colorful feathers. He had to retrieve jewels from various places (including water and fire) and deliver them to a dragon, who then stroked them against the kingfisher's plumage. There was also a story about a hippo who desperately wanted to do ballet, so she kept losing weight until she could wade through the water effortlessly. There was also a feud between an ocelot and a cheetah? Leopard? Some sort of misunderstanding left him upset. I remember the cover to be mainly yellow, with the bow of the ark facing forward and the animals facing forward, as well. I think there was no explicit mention of Noah, but I might be wrong.

goodreads	23018850	1	Brooklynn	2025-02-05T00:00:00Z	There was a book that I used to read with my mom as a child that was about a mom and her daughter and how even though they were different they still loved each other. It may have been written in the 80s or 90s but I read it in the early 2000s which was my childhood. It had beautiful illustrations and the characters were black. From what I remember it was a pretty easy read. It almost reminds me of the little books you read at school when you are first learning how to read. At some point in the book they talk about their favorite colors and the mom liked all types and the daughter says âI like pink and thatâs allâ. I think at some point they ride bikes or skate together. The daughter ends up falling and hurting her chin and the mom tells her to try again. The last detail I remember is that at one point they talk about how the mom likes to wake up early and the daughter sleeps late. And then the daughter says âbut she tempts me with pancakes and I take the baitâ. I really hope someone can help me find it. This year will be the 5th anniversary of my momâs passing and Iâd really like to find it so I can purchase a copy.

goodreads	23019262	1	Annabel	2025-01-27T00:00:00Z	Iâve read this book a year ago and canât remember the title. Essentially, there is one guy, the main character, he has a sister and one day he just leaves his job and starts traveling in his car across the US. Then, as he runs out of money he meets another, younger guy. They enter poker tournaments and they want to get into a big one. They manage and enter the game with one (or two) crazy old guys. They lose everything and since they have no money the old guy offers them the chance to earn money by building a wall of stones in their huge backyard/property. So they live in a container and build the wall slowly. But every time they think they earned enough money, it turns out that the old guys have made some tricks in their contract and they canât leave. The younger tries to escape but ends up being beaten up badly and has to go to a hospital. The book ends with the first guy crashing a car (or we donât really know if this happens) with the guard in it. So they never left the place after all. Thanks for your help guys!! ð

The main character comes in and helps girls who have gone through a bad breakup or been dumped. She helps them find a new hobby (she helps one girl learn how to dj), gets them in good physical shape (I think they did kickboxing), and helps them basically have their golden moment in front of their ex where they then get to reject their ex. It was fun read and Iâve searched everywhere and canât find a trace this book existed. It might have been British? There was one specific scene where the main character was wearing a black tank top and she was fresh out of the shower and her hair was wet but twisted up into a top knot and her love interest thought she was just beautiful. Idk why that part stuck with me 20 years later but here we are. Please help! Itâs driving me bananas!

Book was about a daughter and mom who were on the run constantly moving to different towns and starting new identities. Mom had a tradition where they would go to a library and pick a book and the first name they see is the name they need to go by. Daughter picked a really embarrassing name and was unhappy. Mom eventually goes missing from whoever or whatever they have been on the run from. I AM VERY UNSURE but I think it might have been a red cover with a newspapery motif? Very very unsure.

The title may have been something about a Blue Moon but again, that did not yield any promising results. The main character (again whom I believe is named Nova) is obsessed with space. Her sister died in a fatal car accident that Nova survived. She cant really communicate with anyone, at least not through words but only the sounds she can make. (SPOLIER ALERT) Towards the end of the book she is in class and they are watching the challenger liftoff when it explodes and she freaks out and runs away from the school. If anyone can find this book for me I would be very great full as I have been looking for longer than I would like to admit. Thank you!

goodreads	23022012	1	Megan Lewis	2025-02-27T00:00:00Z	YA books about high schoolers how live next to eachother . The boy has an abusive father and becomes close with the girls family (especially her father who maybe a lawyer) they are best friends and he sneaks into her house using a tree on the nights his dad would abuse him and his mother. They fall asleep together while listening to music (maybe). The boys mother is also being abused. The abusive father starts hurting the son one night and the girl sneaks out of her house to stop the father. She sneaks into the back door and the father sees her and (maybe) beats her for sneaking into his house (she definitely got hurt somehow but I canât remember how exactly). The son gets mad at the girl because he didnât want her to get hurt and now she is hurt because she didnât listen to him when he told her to never go to him house. The cops get called eventually and Iâm pretty sure that the son goes to jail because the mom refused to throw the dad under the bus about being abusive. The girls father is a lawyer and helps him. I remeber the parents having a quirky house and the boy would come over to play chess with the dad and stay for dinner a lot. (I think) There is dual time lines because in the future Iâm pretty sure he is a lawyer and she is back because hr parents just died and she is staying at the house for a while. They reconnect because of her parents died and they are staying at their old houses. I read this books sometime in the last 2 years but am not sure when it was published (definitely a newer book).

goodreads	23022737	1	Marieke	2025-02-05T00:00:00Z	I read this book in the 2010s. The girl, who must have been in her teens at the time of this flashback, had had a sort of panic attack in a grocery store because she couldn't remember who she was. She could only remember liking PB&Js so she bought like 5 loaves of bread and a couple jars of peanut butter and jelly because it was the only thing she could remember liking to eat. I think in a separate flashback she remembers loving peaches (or another juicy fruit), and sitting under a tree and eating arms full of the fruit till the juices ran down her chin. While these flashbacks were in the past, I think in the present she might have been an older lady and maybe the antagonist of the book (but not in an evil way, just cranky old lady way). I originally thought this could be from Pax by Sara Pennypacker but I couldn't fin the moment. After a lot of searches Google suggested The Silent Patient by Alex Michaelides but I again couldn't find the moment with the peaches or in the grocery store.

goodreads	23024658	1	Catherine Alice	2025-02-05T00:00:00Z	Hi guys, been desperate to find this book since I read it as a teenager, here is what I know: I think it was set in the UK and written either in the late 90s or early 2000s, I borrowed it from the school library in around 2005/06. Follows a group of teenage girls who go on either a school (I think) trip where they stay in an activity centre type place. In the first chapter their mini bus drives past a car accident and the character sees a woman with half her face missing or burnt off and can't stop thinking about it, though it is unconnected to the rest of the story. I think this character who witnesses it is called Hen and she has an eating disorder. Each of the girls on the trip has personal problems. Another girl has severe eczema and it is either this girl or another one who is a bit of a bully and ends up falling or being pushed off the roof at the end of the book. Also a girl has sex with a guy in a sandpit and it is uncomfortable to read as he is quite forceful and sexually violent I think. The book had a white cover but I cannot for the life of me think of it's title and it is doing my head in. I will be so grateful if someone can help!

goodreads	23025050	1	Lee Thompson-Kolar	2025-02-05T00:00:00Z	A race of bipedal ocean creatures (picture the Creature from the Black Lagoon) emerge from the sea, and their king declares that his people have a claim to Earth's land. After all, the oceans they inhabit make up 71% of the planet. A human boy (I think an American) trash-talks the antagonistic sea monsters on live TV. Offended by this insult, the sea monster king challenges him to a series of Olympic-styled events. The winner, predictably, gets to keep the land for his people. I think half the events were on land and the other half in the ocean, to keep things fair. One of the events might have been a sparring match on land, but I don't know for sure. The final event is an ocean swim race. The kid bites the king's tail (which is illustrated with the sea monster comically howling in pain). But after that, a jellyfish ends up in their path, and the king gets stung on the rear and is seriously injured. The kid shows him compassion and treats his wound. When the total score is tallied, the kid and the rest of humanity lose the competition. But since the kid helped the king with his injury, he allows humanity to keep the surface world. The sea people dive back into the depths. I read this book in the mid-2000s, but it may be older than that. I think it was an American novel, and it had a handful of illustrations.

They looked somewhat similar to the famous Creature from the Black Lagoon, or the Missing Link from the Dreamworks movie Monsters vs. Aliens. I recall the sea monster king was a tall humanoid with claws and sharp teeth. He has a long tail and two legs (probably with flippers). He had a large, rounded head, I think. The only illustration I specifically remember is in the swim race, where the kid bites the king's tail. It depicts the kid, eyes closed, biting down hard on the tail. The king has gone rigid, tilting his head back and comically howling in pain. If someone could find that drawing, they'd have the book. The problem with Googling books about fish people is that it always brings up merpeople--humans with fish tails. That inevitably leads to mermaid books for young girls, which this story is not."

It is *not* Percy Jackson or the Kane Chronicles anything else by Rick Riordan, though it does sound similar! It is also not going to be Who Let the Gods Out, as that was published later on. I believe it was published to ride the wave of popularity in the mid-2000s of young modern protagonists with Greek mythology figures. I do remember there being two main characters - a girl and a boy, and I believe they were cousins or related somehow. The girl was American and the boy was British, I also believe he was Black. I think their journey led them to the Underworld/Hades? (And, for the sake of being specific, I remember a scene in the book where they argued over whether it was called football or soccer as they kicked a ball around!) Thanks :)

Based on where i remember seeing it, i would think it's classified as children's literature, but based on the subject, i'd guess Young Adult. I vaguely recall it taking place in a small town in the West, Little Town on the Prairie kind of setting. I believe it's told in first person from a teenage girl's perspective. A wolf pack has come into the area, led by a white wolf. Her mother is acting strangely. Eventually, it becomes clear that her mother is a werewolf and was the white wolf. She is killed and the father takes his daughter and (younger?) son away, but the book ends with the daughter's narration saying she is still having dreams about the wolves, but they are calling for her. I don't think i ever read it all the way through, just flipped through it a couple times, but i've been unable to find it anywhere and it's weirding me out.

The government is trying to control all children by forcing them to take drugs, so they all think and behave the same way. The mom is involved with the school where the children will get drugged, but she only manages to keep her son from getting the drugs â not the youngster sister. Younger sister goes freaky, they escape to Canada, I believe â and the teenage boy did some kind of artwork in a tent that (I think) honored his father, who may have been taken away by the government. It turns out heâs pretty well known in Canada, because his artwork story has been circulated. They are working on deprogramming the younger sister when the book ends, trying to get her back to some sort of normalcy. And I want to say the book was from the 1990s or early 2000s, and a female author (but any and all of that might be wrong).

The important part is NDGT said something about going to a planet close to a blackhole. That reminded me of a sci-fi space opera book series I read many years ago. The parts I can remember are how humans are fairly new to space travel. And something to do with a bar or agency where people are paid good money to use some sort of pods that actually belong to whole other species that was thought to have gone into hiding or simply disappeared somehow to avoid being killed off from a even more advanced, brutal, hostile species. From what I remember humans didn't actually understand how to use the pods all that well, but many coordinates were marked as bad because they'd take the pilot to dangerous location so certain death. One human male adult (?) tried his luck and the description said """"the unmistakable maw of blackhole"""". I think this same book involved a murder plot on a space ship, and a who-dunit. I want to say book that takes place in the same series much latter actually involves one of the mysterious species of aliens who were very friendly to humans. So much so that at one point in this books series two kids: one human one of the friendly ___'s (I can't remember the name :( ) but something about they were gaunt and thin, and kind of humanlike, and the author noted that they complained that human math was 'so positional' . I think a human child and a child of family of ____'s went to a library or something? something to do with using a recording device that somehow captured a message from a very brutal old species that everyone thought had died off a long time ago. Somehow this childs recording thing when she took it to someone to figure out what the noise was, that recording accidentally got mixed up for whole other one. And the kids recording was braudcast all across the planet somehow releasing some of the hostile species, as well as alerting the ___'s that were still in hiding to come out and help keep earth from being taken over. I think the ___'s ships were so advanced they were able to hide using blackholes somehow. I had thought these memory snippets might have been from the uplift war series. But I just can't get google to show me enough details for anything to ring a bell. Anyone have some other ideas what the book series I'm trying to remember might be?"

Plot point: While in the past, MC joins a group plotting to steal the very artifact she's been tasked to take from a museum. I believe most of the other members of the group have powers. I also vaguely remember that in one scene the MC sees another character getting ambushed and murdered. She uses her bracelet to escape to the past. Once there, she retrieves the artifact and comes back to the present. SPOILERS: And then once she's back, she finds out that her adoptive father actually orchestrated the supposed 'death' of the previously mentioned character. Turns out they are still alive and it was all staged. He also shot and murdered the leader of the group the MC was a part of in a graveyard.

A man (his brother?, himself?) turns up at her door and says he knew her husband and he is still alive. He takes her across Europe stopping at stops and she has these flashbacks of her husband and their trips. She met him in a tour where he was the guide, they went to places and he would tell vivid stories. He used to be a tour guide. A parallel story runs about a young woman and her father and a war. The man dies, and is reincarnated. The next story is him with a monk and about chickens. The next is about being a soldier. The twist is that he was the person all along and the stories he told her was of himself in his previous lives. Near the end a man comes and brings her to him. Her husband tells her the truth and she says she wants to be like him forever. Minor things I remember: he made the best eggs. They were described as buttery and like a cloud. I think the secret was that he used cream or something and baked it.

Finding my memory failing, I turn to you, my trusted team of book detectives. Grade: 7 Genre: Sci-fi short story Plot: The story is set on another planet, definitely one within our solar system. On said planet, the sun shines for only one day every (decade?). This day is a HUGE deal for the kids because, for just one day, they are able to play outside in the sun like Earth kids do. In our story, Sunshine Day is approaching and a class of kids is getting excited about what they'll do in the sun. There is a new girl in school who is an immigrant, if you will, from Earth. As her classmates excitedly explain their plans, the immigrant tells them she grew up seeing the sun daily. The others ostracize her because they believe she is lying; a world with daily sunshine, to their knowledge, does not exist. Assignment: I remember being assigned to write a letter of empathy to the ostracized girl, telling her I understood how she felt.

It has multiple parts, I want to say three, but I only remember the plot of two parts. Part one: female lead has psychic dreams about people getting murdered by a serial killer. She experiences the murders in first person, feeling the pain, and wakes up with blood all over her bed. Sheâs very scared/timid, but goes to the police station. They donât believe her at first, and then are suspicious of her because she knows about the crime scene. One police officer (male lead) gives her a chance since he has previous experience with others people that have psychic abilities. He sees first hand what happens to her, her documentation about what she remembers, and how it corroborates with the crime scene. He ends up working with her to find the killer and ends up needing to protect her from the killer. Eventually falling in love. Part two: a girl is a disaster first responder with a search and rescue dog. She responds to an earth quake and begins encountering weird things and dead bodies that donât match the disaster. Thereâs a male lead and romance for sure, but I canât remember that part well. Ultimately she finds out one of her friends that responds to disasters with her is the killer.

goodreads	23035620	1	Amy	2025-03-05T00:00:00Z	I read this book as a tween myself. Here is what I remember. Book had a brown western style cover with a picture of a ?cowgirl and/or horse on it. (Maybe face hidden by a hat). I think maybe the title had something to do with cowboyâs. Was from a Christian book store. Storyline - a bit foggy, but starts with a girl on a bus travelling somewhere. Maybe away from something to a ?job? Where she wants to keep her initial identity a secret. Maybe under a name like Sam that could be ambiguous on an application. I feel like she went to work as a cowboy somewhere. Could also have included a mystery about a phantom horse. Thanks for your help if something rings a bell!

I wondered why he didnât have a coat. I wondered, even more, why he looked so alone. âOh, I donât actually need one,â he said. âYou see, I lost my coat at school, and they wouldnât get me another one. Of course, I shouldnât have lost it.â âCoats!â I repeated. I jerked my head. There on the counter was a pile of coats: a tweed coat and a corduroy car coat and a suede jacket. All the time he had gone around in his shirt sleeves, these coats had hung in his closet. I went into my own home. I stood there in the hall. Denny had lied: about college, about his car, about having no coat. Of course my parents had been suspicious! And hadnât I been suspicious, too, without wanting to be?

I got it either at my local library or elementary school library (I'm from the US) and it was age-appropriate for me at the time, so young reader/middle-grade. [Spoilers ahead!] The story follows a magician who arrives at an ordinary town on his bicycle. He performs for the townspeople, with his last and most impressive trick making a handkerchief float in the air. He does this with an anti-gravity elixir he's invented. He convinces the townspeople to use the elixir on a house, making it levitate in the air (including its yard and white picket fence), and then eventually the entire town. They find that when they're floating where the air is thinner, they can think more clearly, and they use the potion again to float higher, and then higher. The third time the air is so thin that they start to lose gravity so they decide to descend. From what I can remember, the cover has a gradient from sky-blue to peach, with the magician on his bike on the lower right. I think the title was one word like """"Gravity"""". I loved this book and have been searching for it practically since I put it down, so any help is much appreciated!

There are these games that they must train for and whoever wins gets money and moves up the ranking system they have in the book. The girl trains a lot and her dad sends her off. I remember this one part where she is practicing and training and the higher level people are watching her and are impressed. During the games if you can die and get killed while trying o play the games. I believe it was like a quadrant structure and there was a center area where they have to reach in order to win after going through all of the obstacles. She ends up winning and I remember towards the end of the book or far into the book there is this boy whose name starts with an X. He is talking to violet and is telling her how his dad is sending him off to war. The book kind of leaves off at that and left me wondering if there is a second book and what happens. The father of the boy X he owns the games and is the king I believe. Thatâs all I can remember of the plot it sounds very similar to Fourth Wing but I read some of that and itâs not it.

Donât remember alot about it other than the FMC covers her skin in a layer of dirt to hide the colour of it. Her skin is alabaster pearl white which is very rare? She may have also had marking on it (like birthmarks not scarring) The MMC forces her into the shower to get her all clean and she panics and once her skin is relieved he is in shock and speechless. She tries to run away. I think he is alien canât remember tho. She was taught to hide her skin by her mom I think. But like she was always applying sand and dirt to her body to hide it as it glowed for some reason. Iâm like 50% sure she was a siren or incubus or something like that. She was taught to hide her skin because if other saw it they would want her. Also 50% sure this is in a series and isnât the first book Probably will never find what this book is as that is the only scene I remember from this book.

I read it sometime between 2019-2022 I have a vague idea of what happens I have a list of things I'm for sure on though The cover features a fallen bicycle. The story involves multiple points of view (at least three). One early scene is set in a lunchroom. The plot centers around teens in a mental health facility, possibly including twins(who were girls). The book includes content warnings at the beginning. other than that it's kinda lost I think that after a few chapters, they get out? and like run into a tank maybe but that's 100% not guaranteed. I also thought the cover with the fallen-over bike it was raining or wet outside or maybe just dark outside. I need help finding it I thought I read it on Libby and it was a DNF. I started reading it at a rough time so I just couldn't get far. One last thing I think I remember is I think there was a guy who was a little creepy to someone maybe one of the twins.

Its about a teen girl who works in a house as the maid her whole life. Her mum used to be the maid but passes away. There's the son of the house who returns from war without the use of his legs(i think). He bascially comes back in a wheelchair. Hes like a big brother to her. His dad has demensia or something and keeps mistaking her for her mother. the book is about her finding out secrets about the house and she basically finds out that she is the man of the house's illegitimate child and the son is actually horrible. the book ends with him trying to kill her for the inheritance. I think the son's name was Simon (might just be my imagination). Also i think you find out the 'Simon' kills her mother. the book was dark blue and i think the title had house in it.

I read a book about a woman who had wanted to marry an Italian man for her whole life, wanted the âItalian stallionâ looks, manners (maybe money? I canât remember if that was part of her criteria!) She eventually finds and marries her âperfect manâ and travels back to Italy with him to meet his family/friends (or maybe they moved there?!) His mother hates her - and wishes he married his childhood sweetheart/friend who is a gorgeous Italian woman While in Italy, sheâs shopping one day and meets an American man (I think the FMC is British!) who maybe makes some point about Italians having quite big cultural differences so she left in a huff (or I got it wrong and it happens later on) I think the couple also have trouble conceiving.. either that or his family are just pushing for them to start having children too soon! Either way, they start having some marital problems Husband then starts cheating with said Italian woman, and the FMC is embarrassed/hurt and goes off into town, where she meets the American man (again, if I was right earlier) and they fall in love and get together Iâm so sorry for the somewhat crazed explanation - I hope it is recognisable to someone whoâs read it too? Either that or I imagined this whole book, but Iâm so sure I didnât!

I believe she had a friend (or frenemy) who was a boy about her age. She made progress towards solving her mystery/problem with the help of mysterious notes left to her by a homeless man (possible spoilers ahead) the old homeless man may have been implied to be a time traveler, and possibly the future version of her young male friend. Other than the possibility of a time travel element it seemed less of a supernatural or scifi genre, and more of a detective story.

See following summary from Wikipedia: In the late Elizabethan era, a fourteen-year-old orphan known only by his nickname, Widge, has learned shorthand, a method of rapid writing by means of abbreviations and symbols, from his previous master, a preacher who wants Widge to steal other preachers' sermons. Bass, his new master, wants to use Widge's skill to transcribe William Shakespeare's Hamlet before Shakespeare prints it. Widge sets off to London with Falconer, a ruthless man whom Bass assigns to ensure Widge succeeds. Hamlet's performance so enraptures Widge that he forgets part of his assignment, and when he returns for a second try, his notebook is stolen. Widge eventually settles into the acting troupe by posing as a hopeful player, and The Lord Chamberlain's Men accepts him. For the first time, Widge feels part of a real family. But it's hard for him knowing his duty is to not be a part of this family but to steal from them. Falconer continues to press Widge to steal the play, resulting in a constant cat and mouse chase between them. After Falconer, who turned out to be Bass in disguise, dies in a duel with The Lord Chamberlain's Men shareholder Robert Armin, Widge remains at The Globe to work toward his dream of being a player.	solved	The Shakespeare Stealer	96400	by Gary Blackwood part of series: Shakespeare Stealer 
goodreads	23040653	1	duplankk	2025-03-05T00:00:00Z	I read this when I was in elementary school and remember really enjoying it. It takes place around the late 1500s to early 1600s, and the main character is a poor teen boy who I think was an orphan. Needing money, he accepts and offer from a wealthier man to go undercover working backstage at one of William Shakespeare's shows, and steal one of the plays that Shakespeare was writing to that the wealthy man could plagiarize it and pretend it was his own. Predictably the kid ends up realizing why what he's doing is wrong, and starts really enjoying working in the theatre. He refuses to steal the play and if I remember correctly he starts full-time working for Shakespeare so he isn't lacking money anymore. I know the details are kind of vague since I read it so long ego, but hopefully it's enough since this book was a pretty big part of my childhood and I'd really like to find it again!

goodreads	23041772	1	Fleur D'Ã©pines	2025-03-05T00:00:00Z	Hey there! I read this book in 2015 so I don't remember much about it, only that I had quite enjoyed it and have been wondering for years what the title was. I read the book in french but am pretty sure it took place in the US (so I'm assuming it's from an American author). I am also quite positive it was written in 1st person POV. I think it was a trilogy but I had only read the 1st book and think I started the 2nd. - The main character was a 14y/o girl. She ran track and I'm pretty sure her older brother passed away (??), she was struggling with living a normal life after that, I don't think she had an easy homelife. She felt quite relatable to my 14 year old self as she seemed withdrawn from her peers, cynical, and sarcastic. Her thoughts were funny at times and the books stuck with me since it at times felt like I was reading about myself/my struggles. - The love interest was one of her brother's friends who was more of an aloof troubled teen, I think he used to play ice hockey but was kicked off the team for fighting at some point. I'm pretty sure one of the last scenes of the 1st book was him punching someone but it might have been a fever dream. I think there were rumours going around about him being a violent person and it being linked to him getting kicked off the team, but the mc has trouble believing it cause she remembers him as a kind person (I think she often said stuff about his kind and pretty eyes? Not sure). I vividly remember him being at the very least 17 cause being 14 myself I felt like the age gap was icky and was wondering how that was okay/a thing. It was pretty weird he was interested in her. Some scenes I remember: - At some point in the book she goes to the doctor for a checkup and ends up talking about her reproductive health. - Pretty sure there was also a scene where she was in Art class and was drawing flowers all over the paper cause she didn't know what else to do, the teacher saw that and excitedly asked her if she was interested in textile design. She awkwardly said yes cause how do you admit that's not it at all. - She once complained about dudes who use Axe deodorant. (Might have been at the very beginning of book 2). I know this isn't much, but I'd be grateful for any type of info. Thanks in advance!	unusable			series

The title was WINDOWS THROUGH TIME, PORTALS IN TIME, or something along those lines. The plot concerned a young boy who discovers time portals in/near his house. Some plot points I remember: - The boy visiting a volcanic world with people riding prehistoric beasts. - Him meeting a mysterious but friendly stranger in one timeline, who reveals that he is his future self. The boy doesn't believe him. Until the stranger tells him that he got the scar on his face from falling off the roof of his house when he was a child. - Him traveling to a further dystopian future where he's chased by these man-sized ferret-like creatures. To avoid them he climbs the base of this crumbling, ancient towering statue. He notices the giant statue's feet and even though they're fractured/degraded, he sees that they are sneakers. He looks up and sees that it's a giant statue of himself. The book had B&W illustrations. The cover was blue and showed the boy falling and surrounded by several portals.

Read in Germany in the late 2000s I believe, but I can't remember the language (English or German). There is a side-character called 'Ruth' in the book which would point to it being a translation from English. The story was about a girl with divorced parents. She has a younger sister with down-syndrome, they both live with her mother and sometimes visit the father and his new girlfriend, who I believe was described as rich. Her first boyfriend kills himself, I believe by drowning. Her second boyfriend dies after being shoved by a boy, who I believe was called Paul. At first the girl sends that boy 'hate-calls' in the middle of the night, sometime later he becomes her boyfriend. When he finds out it was her behind the calls he leaves her.

goodreads	23045386	1	Kat M	2025-03-05T00:00:00Z	YA-Adult graphic novel, pretty mature/dark themes, read sometime between 2015-2020 & likely published anywhere btwn 2000-2020. I picked it up on vacation either at the Richmond Main Public Library in Virginia or a bookstore around that area. As for plot stuff I remember it being about a teenage boy living in this smaller town where kids keep dying from poisoned Halloween candy each year (so maybe loosely based on the real life Candy Man killer). Time period wise it might've been a little while in the past, since I don't remember phones/technology playing a big role but could be wrong. Main character had someone close to him die, maybe a brother, & I remember ghosts playing a pretty large role in the story as well especially when it came down to figuring out who the killer was. Also remember a specific scene where the main character gets chased by the town bullies and either had pumpkins thrown at him or something else involving pumpkins. By the end of the novel there were pretty strong themes of coming of age, and I'm fairly sure the author was a man. The comic may have been monochromatic (like green or smth) but I'm not sure.

He pictures a room in his mind with windows, and each of those windows can be opened or closed to talk to someone else's mind. The boy has a wolf companion that is also psychic. There are several races of beings also psychic. One of them is a gorgon-like species that can mind blast, but he can withstand it by closing that window, which surprises the other species. There is also a cave and one of the humans has the power to shake the earth, which hasn't been heard of in humans in a long time.

The book was part of a class assignment when we were covering latin american literature and magical realism. It may have been written in Spanish originally, if so, I was reading an English translation. The protagonist is a man who happens to write children's plays, perhaps he is a relatively beloved librarian. His wife may have been some sort of city administrator. Either way, I believe her outspokenness got her abducted-- """"disappeared"""" -- as they refer to militia-led kidnappings that have ravaged the country and led people to comply out of fear. The protagonist is heartbroken, distraught, but doesn't know what to do. In his despair, he has a dream, in which he sees his wife in a sorry state, perhaps having recently been tortured. When he wakes, he is thrilled to have seen her alive, and he begins feeling like he can bring her back... Not entirely sure where it was going from there because that's all I read. Any thoughts, ideas, suggestions? Thanks a million."

goodreads	23046986	1	Tara	2025-03-05T00:00:00Z	I'm looking for a book that I read years ago - maybe 2012-2018ish. It was about a high school girl who lived on a farm in the Australian outback with her father and brothers. Spoilers ahead! Her mother (divorced) essentially blackmailed her to move to the city to live with her and go to school there. The next door neighbour is in her year at school and they have a hate to love relationship - he's a polished kid set to be a pro surfer, with perfectionist parents. She gets up to a load of hijinks throughout the story: she steals a digger in the middle of the night and does something to his jeep. She has brought her horse with her (or maybe one of her brothers brings it up) and rides it about town. On a school field trip she sees a cow in distress giving birth in a field and she stops the bus and goes help with the calfing. She makes friends with the grumpy old man whos farm this is on then starts working on his farm. On her farm back in the country they have a massive bull thats super grumpy but loves her and lets her ride him. He gets brought to the old mans farm in the city and I'm sure she rides the bull in town to annoy her mother or something. I swear the book was called Avalon, but I've gone through all my book purchase histories and googled till I'm blue in the face and I can't find it anywhere. Please help!

I read it in high school, and have been unable to piece together enough clues to find it. The main thing that I vividly remember is that the female main character is looking for answers to something, and runs away from a rough life. Along the way, she meets a boy named Lennon, and eventually also meets his brother (I think brother?) Jude. It is a running joke that their parents loved the Beatles. I also vividly remember that Lennon and Jude live in quite a fancy house, but that's about all I can remember. The book seemed fairly new at the time, with some modern themes, I would say it was written no more than 5-10 years before I read it. The time period seemed modern day but could have been futuristic. I know this is a tough one... I wish I could remember more. Thank you in advance for the help!

It was set as a comedic mystery/heist sort of in the style of Carl Haaisen but definitely not one of his. There's a man who contacted by a friend who wants to steal a wheel of cheese. It's priceless because it was made with the bacteria from some female celebrity's underpants. I think it was actually Carrie Fisher. Since she's dead it's not possible for this cheese to ever be made again. They get the bacteria from housekeepers who steal dirty underpants (I swear this is NOT pornography) or handkerchiefs or whatnot. THey discuss the possibility of stealing the cheese and either the plan doesn't work or they realize it won't and give up. But the handkerchief that was used to make the chief is still in existence.

The main character was Sabina/Sabine and the MMC was Ice. I'm pretty sure they were wizards of some sort but I'm not sure if the book used the term mage or witches and wizards. The book starts off with a bunch of characters in a safe house of sorts that gets attacked and then the two main characters get split up from the rest of the group. I think they were hiding in the trees at one point while they were on the run. Then it was kind of like an enemies to lovers/forced proximity deal. At another point near the end of the book, the MMC has a duel with another guy. It was part of a series. Any help at all would be immensely appreciated!

Itâs a Southern Gothic historical fiction novel (with elements of magical realism). The main character is a young woman who is known in her small town as a healer. When she was younger, she thought her tongue was bitten off by a snake, but later, itâs revealed that it was actually a boy who sexually assaulted her and cut off her tongue. She believes her healing powers are religious and linked to the snake incident. Later in the book, thereâs a doctorâs son who came back from war without legs, and she helps him with his phantom pain. The man who worked with the doctorâs son in the army is a motorcycle rider, and he becomes her love interest. The book ends with this man saving her from being raped by the boy who attacked her as a child.

I read it in middle school around 2008-2011, and I might have gotten the book from a Scholastic book catalogue. What I can remember: -Her mom had passed away or disappeared, so she lived with her dad. -One of the books was set at a boarding school or a prep school. She was communicating with a ghost who had been a student at the school. The ghost might have been bullied or was trying to harm a popular group of girls. -One of the books involved her having a sleepover with friends who tried to get her to communicate with the dead (possibly her mom?). For some reason I feel like her house might have had some sort of tower and/or garden where this took place. Iâve searched online and some folks say it might be The Mediator series, but Iâm not sure thatâs it. Maybe Iâm misremembering and confusing two book series together!

goodreads	23054878	1	Marietta Weaver	2025-03-05T00:00:00Z	Iâm looking for a series of (at least) two manga anthologies with a title somewhere in the realm of yearâs best mangaâ? Might also have had different seasons, like âwinter 2005â? I read them somewhere around the 2000âs or 2020âs Each book was a different year- I think it was a compilation of contest winners??? Either way, the stories varied in style and genre with no particular theme. They were pretty thick, too- like three normal manga volumes stuck together. I remember two stories (which may or may not be in the same book). The first one was a fantasy story. There was a cursed boy with a demon arm and the old man who raised him. They go to a dungeon to find a cure. The boy is uncursed by an angel, but it turns out the boy was actually a demon cursed into a boy, and the angel admonishes the man saying they were nothing but âlambs to the slaughterâ, which the demon echoes. The second story is a depressing romance where a man is forcibly betrothed to a girl with a lethal disease that will cause her to die very young that also causes mermaid like scales to appear on her back, as her father *really* wants an heir to the family. Itâs also like a bl simultaneously. The guy whoâs into the main character helps him out with getting the girl. The girl dies, but the main character has a daughter who also has the fish scale condition. The books also had a handful of art pieces / pin ups as well. The only one I can remember is one called â Prosthetic Cop Nameâ or something like that, featuring a female character with the disability superpower of specialized high tech prosthetics. Youâd think with how highly specific these things are, finding them would be easy, but it really isnât. Itâs especially annoying because I know not just one, but ALL of them were mentioned on relevant Tvtropes trope pages before, but it looks like someone edited all those mentions out entirely, so Iâve nothing left to go on.	unusable			series

Chapter book(s) of a possible series. Main character boy discovers he has superpowers of teleportation when he suddenly teleports from his car to a dog he sees in danger across the street. This boy is recruited by an organization that his father was secretly affiliated with. The father had previously gone missing on an expedition to find a termed """"dragon"""" that ends up being explained as an alien race of starfish shaped creatures. The boy has a female informant who poses as his nanny while he lives his double life as an agent and a normal student and son. The boy also has a female companion who dies and is transformed from a human to a ghostly raven apparition that can appear out of a crowd of ravens to communicate with the boy. Below is commenting along with my recent response on regular help request forums on GoodReads website that I found and I wanted to bring to WtNoTB: Post: I would like to find a book about a boy with powers and a girl who turns into a crow girl hybrid In the book, thereâs this boy that can teleport or shapeshift, the first scene is when he travels from his car to the other side of the street to save a dog. It was a duology, and he had a female friend. I think he had gotten recruited for this like group of people with superpowers. I think they fought against bad guys. There was someone in particular that was going after him, a guy in a suit and hat. Something happens towards end of the book and in the second book, the female friend comes back from the dead but this time she is a crow/raven hybrid, and I think that guy in the suit turned her into that, she also apparently the guy in the story bc I think it was his fault she died. Thereâs also a scene where he gets trapped in a fire and she comes to save him. I remember that place that was burning had this guy who seemed like a good huh but could actually control the dolls in that house and caused the fire. The cover of the book was green with a grey bird in the top half, the bird was coming down so the beak was in the middle, like a V shape, and the title was in long thin letters. I also remember it was either fantasy/sci-fi. If it helps, I read it once on get epic. My response: YES YES YES, THIS IS THE BOOK I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR TOO! There was a girl that I remember as being just someone from the boy's past, a classmate or something. I remember another female friend of the boy who was actually an agent for the group he was recruited by. She posed as his nanny. Also, the father of the boy was affiliated with the organization and had gone searching for a """"dragon"""" which turns out to have been aliens that looked like sea stars and they sort of merged with the father's body? That's revealed toward the end when the boy drags his sister into the conspiracy hunt, too. The agency lied that the father was missing so that the boy would be driven to work with them, but then he finds they were lying and they were holding him the whole time in a suspended state of animation because he couldn't live normally due to the interaction with the aliens. There's also some sort of face off at the end where the boy has to choose who to trust and then defeat the baddie? I forget that part, but the crow girl thing and the dog teleport thing I remember! Also, I describe it as both sci-fi and fantasy."	unusable			series

Each illustration was accompanied by a sentence or two, describing what the cat was doing in a cute, humorous way. The illustrations were simple and cute, mostly in white, blue, and red. The cat was white with a red collar. I remember the last two pages showed the cat sleeping with their owner (a blonde woman I think) and ended with the cat dreaming. The last lines were, âBe loved. Dream.â I remember the size of the book was sort of small and rectangular; sort of like a book for newspaper comic strips.

Their dog is so unsettles in the house that he won't stop talking and eventually goes missing The book ends with the dog returning but won't come 10 feet near the hour and sits outside instead, the worried family instead go to him to see what's wrong as soon as they're a safe distance from the house, it goes up in flames. I think i remember a fridge alphabet magnet rearranging scene that happens before that too, but i'm not too sure.

I think he jumped to try and save someone who fell onto the tracks? In one time travel incident he gets arrested and then bailed out by either the Irish or Italian mob because of his last name, and he then works as an indenturer. I think it was an Irish last name the more I think about it? In another incident he time travels to the Great Depression. He talks about the homeless people all over Central Park. He goes to buy a burger and the guy at the counter says âplease, itâs been 2 days,â and they split the burger. Later when the protagonist is starving and crying on the street corner, his friends are trying to comfort him and a wealthy woman discretely hands them an apple to give to him once heâs collected himself. The last time travel era is during WWII. He runs into his friend he shared the burger with while on a bus or train or something, and the man is now in uniform and missing an arm. In the end he travels back to the present the same way he came, by falling into the subway tracks. Heâd saved the persons life and is reunited with his little sister in the end. I wouldâve read this sometime around 2010? Give or take a few years.

I'm assuming it was YA because although I was exceptionally precocious, and read far above my age level, I was also crushing on Laura Ingalls Wilder at the time, who, in the TV series, would have been a few years older than me (circa 1974). But anyhow...as far as I can at all remember, the story in question starts out with an earthquake off of the California coast (probably) which dislodges a green stone artifact in the form of an amphibious alien species, and which is then found, and retrieved, by a young man who helps out in his father's business (as a salvage diver, probably). Thing is though, the green stone artifact is not made of stone. Not hardly. In fact, it is very much alive! And it is awakening. And it has plans.

The boy is a popular kid, well-liked by his classmates, and completely smitten in love with the Indian girl. I think the Indian girl is bullied, or marginalised? I don't quite remember the details, but there is some societal pressure keeping the two apart, despite them caring about each other. There's a background story involving a ghost, and SPOILERS: this plot is resolved with the discovery that the ghost was the Indian girl's ancestor, who was murdered. The English boy was introduced to the girl in the first place, because his grandfather was in love with the murdered girl and always regretted not being able to save her, or avenge her with justice? I remember right at the end of the book, the grandfather goes to the police to reopen the case, even knowing there's little chance of justice decades later. And there's an analogy throughout the book, of the Englishmen 'stomping' through the grass. uncaring of what they destroy in their path, I think referring to colonisation? And the boy and girl are happy at the end, I think. I mostly remember the line about when the boy met the girl, from his perspective: 'She was cradled in her father's arms, and her long eyelashes blinked blinked blinked at me, and I knew I'd always be wrapped around her little finger', or something along those lines. I don't remember the cover or the names at all, just that there was a strange supernatural undercurrent to the whole thing.

So this kid lives in a giant like really big spaceship and itâs in the future. I donât know if people still live on earth or not but weâll get to that later. I think he has a job or is an apprentice but I remember a factory so idk. One day he finds a red feather and I don think they have birds or any kind of animals so itâs pretty cool for him. Um I think that people from different planets (maybe earth??) visit at one point. He either is close to his dad or his grandfather. Also this I read Iâm and weird but I remember one quote from this book and itâs when he and his friend are play fighting and his friend goes âyou ruptured my spleen!â And for some reason that was so funny. Also it might MIGHT be sort of based on Robin Hood but I donât know.

ANOTHER IMPORTANT SPOILER *i think this is the biggest plot detail i remember* time elapses, and she one day wakes up with a tiny speck of blood on her sheets. by then, her maid is besties with her and realizes her severe homesickness because she's missing out on her magic period ceremony (i think its called first light maybe?) and the maid offers to help do the laundry in this secret place she knows. its basically an underground lake underneath the castle, and when it gets to be nighttime, the water glows due to some sort of magic algae. the maid then surprises her by sharing a traditional womanhood ceremony with her that involves dancing and a ritual swim, along with changing her dress. SPOILER AGAIN i believe there is an SA, she is forcibly married off the the ruler and then moved to this dormitory situation with all the other wives *that she didn't know existed*. there is some other violent treatment of the wives by the guards and the ruler, i'm pretty sure he hits one of them. main character realizes she has to get out and she runs away with her bestie maid. they escape through the underground magic pool from earlier, and run into the dessert. at this point we're only like halfway through the book, but i completely forget the ending. i think there might be more than one book, but not more than a trilogy. i do know that at one point they are going crazy from thirst and have a whole hallucination scene. that's basically all the main information i remember, i found the book in a public school classroom library when i was in like middle school. thank you for looking, i would love to find this book again."

There may have been some houses on the cover and I think a woman in a burgundy skirt and light blue blouse looking out at the water from the grass and you only see her back. The more I try to remember, I feel I might be getting mixed up with other book memories, so Iâm not entirely sure there was even a woman on the cover. I think she was on a train as a child and her name was Mary and she may have had no memory of her past. She does different things to get by, acting in a play is one I remember. Somehow she meets a man who doesnât say much and he helps her. He may have been a criminal of some sort but is actually a good man. I think they end up together.

goodreads	23070594	1	Anneke DeHaan	2025-03-05T00:00:00Z	This book was a favorite of mine as a child, but I cannot for the LIFE of me, remember it!! It was a very sweet novel, the children lived on an island with their mother. I do not believe their father was ever mentioned, but there was a town across the waters (or maybe on the island but far away). It felt like it was written in the 80s, but it could have been sooner than that. Specific details that stuck out to me: -There was a nest of storks living in the chimney of the house. The family loved them very dearly. -When the brother and sister go to town for a festival, they come home with a box of kitten (possibly ducklings) and must take care of them. This is VERY vivid in my memory. They took a ship out to town and had to sail back. -Shadowy figures outside in the night made the children very scared. -By the end of the novel, it is revealed that the family (who are quite poor) have been living on a property with a buried Viking burial ship. This ship belonged to a Viking Queen (or king? But it felt very feminine for some reason) They get rich because of this. -There was a specific man who was connected to the family, but not the father. He might have been searching for the Viking ship, and snuck around the yard in the night searching, thus scaring the kids inside. -The boy was the older sibling; the girl was much younger and very sweet. -there is a specific conversation wherein the mother talks about a possible Viking practice where the father would take his newborn child and leave them outside to die if the child wasn't capable of living past birth or something??? Very weird, I don't know why I remember that so specifically. -set in an unspecified time, but there were working lights and running water in most places. However, the family was quite poor and lived like it was much closer to the 1800s or mid 1900s. Reminded my brother and I of Boxcar children or Magic Treehouse...

The girl lived in a culture where shipbuilding was important, and there was a sacred tree that was perfect for shipbuilding but they didn't want to cut it down because it was sacred. It had a beehive in it and they used the honey from the beehive to make the mead in which the girl was fed the poison. I don't remember why she was sacrificed. It was *not* The Light in the Forest, but I believe it had a similar title and I read it about the same time. I believe the story was based on the discovery of the Egtved Girl though that term was not used in the book. Spoiler follows: They did end up cutting down the tree, and it fell on the part that was perfect for a ship and cracked, so it never ended up being able to be used in a ship after all.

goodreads	23073572	2	Tara	2025-03-27T00:00:00Z	book-Anya returned home to a horrifying scene: a masked intruder held her parents at gunpoint, demanding they hand over their vast fortune, a fortune they knew she already inherited years ago. When they refused, the intruder coldly executed them in front of her, then swiftly abducted Anya, forcing her into a sham marriage with a wealthy, ruthless man as a ploy to access her inheritance. The wedding day arrived, a lavish spectacle meant to legitimize the villain's claim to Anya's wealth. However, just as the vows were about to be exchanged, a team of skilled operatives, loyal to Anya's late father, stormed the ceremony, creating chaos to rescue her. In the ensuing struggle, Anya was shot, critically wounded, and the rescue mission was nearly compromised. To prevent the villain from getting his hands on her fortune, the only option was for the brave rescuer, a man named Alex, to marry Anya immediately. Though their union was born out of dire necessity, Alex proved to be a true protector, not just of Anya's money, but her life. As they navigated the aftermath of the ordeal, their initial forced marriage began to blossom into a genuine connection, fueled by their shared trauma and a newfound determination to bring the villain to justice.

goodreads	23075816	1	Edith	2025-04-05T00:00:00Z	I read it over 5 years ago so probably 2010s. the book is about a girl whos sister dies and on a special night she keeps her light on instead of stopping it so her sisters spirit came come back and it takes the form of a bird. her sister died because a young prince came to visit as children and went to join the two sisters on the roof but his part collapsed and the sister sacrificed herself. there are flashbacks to when the three of them are younger throughout the book like one where the young king where learning to play fmcs fav board game. It begins with the dmc agreeing to marry the king to help with a common enemy or something like that but she despises him because of her sister. the first scene I remember is when they are traveling back to his castle and a sandstorm hits them. (the sisters spirit as a bird owl I think is with her the whole time mostly on her shoulder). the next they are at a building for the night (medieval setting) and she overhears her best friend talking to the king and believe he slept with her cause the friend was telling her about being pregnant (ended up being fmcs brothers bfs was too scared to tell fmc and she was of lower status). the next scene I remember is they are in the kingdom and her sister has been caught and the enemy lady gives her a knife to kill the king which would also bring back sister. fmc later receives sisters wing as threat. the next scene I remember she gets on a purple night grown or something and sleeps with prince (fade to black) to steal the key he has which would let the enemy in (dmc starting to fall for king). then enemy storms castle and dmc protects king but he is betrayed and leaves with his sister on dragons. next s\cene I remember the enemy has dmc in. front of kingdom and is beheding her or similar for treason but king comes back and aves her. as it is a special knight (which happens once a year) her sisters spirit takes back on a human form but it is off and turned evil from being kept alive for so long. when the king lets the dmc stab him to bring back sister, dmc stabs sister instead putting her to rest.

goodreads	23075837	1	Solar Beams	2025-04-05T00:00:00Z	Hi, thanks a lot for that group! I am looking for a book series that is at least two volumes long, but maybe more. I read the books when I was a child and I re-read them as a pre-teen so between 2003 and 2008. I have to say they were more intended for teenagers, I think, I was copying my big sister. I read the books in French but I am quite sure they were translated. They were not long, pocket books. The main protagonist is a teenage girl, I believe she is aged 15 at the start and her name is Kai. Kai is not very pretty, she is quite petite, she has ash-blond hair and dark eyes, she ususally wears black. She is very fierce and strong-minded. I don't remember anything about the start of the book but I believe she was living in a sort-of pre-industrialised or minimalist or merely poor society with her parents and, I think, her twin brother. She got separated from her family for a reason I don't remember and arrived in a modern city, where she worked as a servant, maybe to infiltrate a rich family, and there and she hid her true identity with a fake name, but I have no idea why, even if that was pretty important. I think it is because that rich society attacked her native one and she was on the look for her family. [spoiler] In that rich family, there was the son who fell in love with her and I remember he was obsessed with her dark eyes and kept repeating her fake name in his head, but eh she was kind of there to kill him so it was not a good starter for a love story. At some point a princess arrived in the story, she was really beautiful, with long golden hair and really rich. Kai despised her, she despised everyone from that rich city anyway. Then, there was an event, everybody was running away, Kai and the princess were together, the boy who was in love with her disappeared and we never heard of him any more. The princess gets sick of being chased for her beauty, takes a knife and cuts her two cheeks and gets two big scars. Kai starts to respect her more. Then Kai and the princess arrive in a desert where they are captured into as slaves into a new kind of society which is clannic. There are to be given as spouses to young men of this society, who fight each other in some competition to win them over. The first to win chooses one of the girls first, then the second, and so on. Kai is considered to be too petite and dark to make a good wife, so she is chosen by the fifth or something, whereas the princess, who is tall and well-proportionned, even is her face is scarred, is chosen by the big winner. I even remember a woman from the clan examined them to evaluate their breeding capacities and she took the princess's jaw in her hand to look at her teeth, like a horse, and said she was really healthy. Then Kai and the princess escape during the wedding night and in the end they find her family (and even more people?) and they all go to a land that is considered as mythic but which is their last chance to live without being persecuted. The princess and Kai's brother get really close. I'm sorry if some of the things I said are not true, I can't really remember a lkt of things from that book except from that poor boy who fell in love with fake name of a girl who secretly hates him, and the fact she was considered a poor breeder, but the scarred princess a good one. I did a goodgle research first and the only connection I found was this desceiption by someone who cannot find a book title either: It seems very similar to the nook I am looking for, only I have no memory of Kai being amnesic or having superpowers, so I am not sure. However, the wyverns race anecdote in a canyon rings a bell to me. I think that's what happened when Kai and the princess ran away from the desert tribe. I thank everyone in advance who would like to help me! Take care!	unusable			series

(i feel like she maybe wasnt allowed to tell people her mum was sick for some reason?) - when her dad takes her to the care facility her mum is staying at, the girl gets mixed messages and thinks that she is out of the hospital because she is getting better, but actually she is going to this new place because she is about to die. - the dad is super kind and caring, and loves his wife a lot. - i think she has a younger sister?

Recommended to me as being similar to James Herriot and Gerald Durrell's works. Young single woman (20-30?) moves to live on Scottish isle. Documents her time settling into life there and understanding the residents, as they speak a lot of Scots Gaelic. Unsure of time period. Could be anywhere from 1900s to 1950s? Believe it was non-fiction biography, but may have been fiction, or even fiction based on true life events? The possible animal angle. One thing I definitely remember is the main character taking care of an injured pigeon. An islander misunderstands her when she brings it up in conversation as the word pigeon sounds like the Scots Gaelic for a beer belly? He then refers to the bird as a dove after clearing up the confusion.

goodreads	23077609	1	Erin Lawler	2025-04-05T00:00:00Z	Hi - looking for the name of this book. I read it around 2005 - 2012 and I believe it is an by an Australian author. It follows a young girl who is overweight and has blue hair. She is getting in trouble at home after her Vietnamese boyfriend dies in a car crash and she is sent to live in the Victoria country side with her aunt who is a famous painter (character was called Fran I believe). Her uncle was a Vietnam war veteran who had a friend called Blue. The girls mum was called Gertrude and she came out to visit the girl part way through the book and left a heater on which ended up burning the house down. The story also explains the story behind a special painting that shows a young girl in a red dress floating in a creek surrounded by plants. It turns out this was a family member who committed suicide at a young age. The girl gradually loses weight and changed her hair colour and realised she has talent at making pottery figurines and she volunteers to make some for the local church community for Christmas (she makes a nativity scene) and right at the very end she goes back to the Vietnamese family who she knew (the daughter was her friend and the son was her boyfriend - called Minh I believe) and she was worried they would reject her because of the car crash, but they were happy to see her again.

goodreads	23077950	1	Jade Shields	2025-04-05T00:00:00Z	"Read in UK school library 2010-2015. I think the cover was mostly black but unsure on this. FMC goes back to hometown to find answers about her mother and sister's death. She suspects that a man who her mother was seeing at the time killed her mum and sister. He was a children's entertainer and dressed up as a clown. When the FMC returns to her hometown she befriends the guy who is now living in the house where the """"murder"""" happened. They strike up a romance and she always insists on sleeping downstairs. I believe she was raised by her aunt and aunt's boyfriend? The FMC has flashbacks to her upbringing throughout the story. I think it was her trying to make sense of what happened. She has flashbacks regarding the man her mum was seeing (the clown entertainer) and also has a flashback about her aunt visiting. I think that it begins to unravel that FMC's mother was struggling with her mental health. Spoilers ahead: At the end of the book the FMC eventually goes upstairs. I can't remember if it's to the room where the """"murder"""" happened or the attic, but her old dollhouse that was in the room at the time of the murder is still in the house. She is looking through the dollhouse and looks behind the wallpaper in one of the dollhouse rooms (I don't remember if it's because she noticed anything different or maybe her and her mum used to leave notes in the dollhouse to eachother). She peels back the wallpaper to find a suicide note from her mum. The FMC has a flashback back to waking up in her bed and feeling something sticky on her neck, she realises it's blood. Her mum and sister are in the bed with her and already dead. She realises then that her mum killed herself, FMC's sister and tried, but failed, to kill FMC. I'm realising that this was really dark to read as a young teen but my brain cannot rest until I find this book. I know that it's not any of the dollhouse murders books. Any help appreciated!!"

goodreads	23077998	1	Kalmisu	2025-04-05T00:00:00Z	When I was in middle school 2015-2017, I read this series and Iâm just realizing it shaped a lot of who I am so now Iâm trying to find it. I remember very specific details but nothing big enough to find it upon searching. Main character is a high school girl. Book starts with her and her family moving into a new house. She gets a bad vibe immediately when looking at the house because of the tree in the front yard. Itâs super old, big, creepy looking, and itâs the main thing all the ghosts in the house are attached to. It might have to do with one of the ghostâs death. Main character has a younger sibling. Theyâre helping their younger sibling with a family tree project for school. Main character might have a major artistic ability so they help their sibling draw the tree for the family tree and she ends up drawing the creepy tree from the front yard exactly. She doesnât realize sheâs doing this until it is already completely drawn so I think she was being possessed when she was doing this? This happens in the first book. Main character also likely has a major hair color change to an unnatural color, pretty sure itâs pink, might be blue or purple, but I think I remember liking the main character had pink hair. This happens in a different book. The main characterâs main personality trait is photography, thatâs her thing. Her and a bunch of other girls are under the influence of a spirit, being possessed, and in exchange for being part of this possession/doing what the spirit wants, their lives become perfect. Main character becomes popular and perfect at everything while under this possession/cult-thing with the other girls. She is interviewing for a scholarship (maybe to join an art school/ program but I think sheâs interviewing for a scholarship) for her photography. While under this possession that makes her perfect she does the interview for the scholarship and answers the question âwhatâs your favorite photo?â with a monologue. The monologue is about how her favorite photo is one titled âcan of peasâ thatâs literally just a photo of a can of peas. But she explains to the interviewers that the photo was taken by a man who was going blind who was taking photos of the things heâs gonna miss seeing. The can of peas photo is her favorite because she thinks itâs beautiful how even a can of peas can be beautiful to you once you think you may never seen them again. She eventually breaks out of the influence of the possession and flunks a follow-up interview or something and her life goes back to normal. Again, I only remember these hyper-specific scenes so itâs hard to search for this book. Let me know if you know what this trilogy is or if you can recommend a better way to search for this book with the information I have. I wouldnât be the same person if I never read these books. I created a good reads account to find this series, so this is my first post. Let me know if I didnât do it right.Thank you!	unusable			book series

They met a couple of men, who took them back to their house in a car. I donât remember when happened then, but I think the girl fell asleep? And then she woke up and saw them kill her friend. I think the men were part of some sort of mafia group or something. They then noticed her so she ran, I think barefoot and through water or something, and she escaped them. Then Iâm blanking on the bit after that, but it then skips to her as an adult, she lives in a house in some woods, and her house has loads of security and cameras I think that alert her to when someone passes the boundary line.she is scared still they are looking for her. This man comes into the picture, I donât remember why he goes to her house, maybe to deliver something? But they become interested in each other romantically after some time, and I think she ends up telling him what she saw. And I thinkkk that the media men might have come for her?

goodreads	23078460	1	Michael	2025-03-27T00:00:00Z	Hi, I wish I can remember the name of this sci-fi series of novels. I think there are 3 books in total and the author is probably American or British. It's either from the late 1990s or early 2000s, so too far back for me to remember. In the far future, humanity is capable of travelling to other dimensions and an artificial dimension has been discovered. This particular universe is infinite horizontally but has a limit vertically. The aliens that created this world had made first contact with Imperial China, so they created their own human species - tall albinos who otherwise appear Chinese and the culture and technology is of that time. The focus character of the 1st novel is a space explorer who seeks revenge on this dimension. It's because there's also a telepathic centauroid species who blinded his daughter. However he's unaware that her blinding is voluntary, an unfortunate but accepted side-effect of their bestowing telepathy on her. All help for this novel/series would be much appreciated, thank you.	unusable			book series

The bird is a Swift or Swallow or something similar. The bird then migrates and the brother leaves to do charity work in Africa. On the way to Africa the bird is caught in a boat net and loses its leg. Meanwhile the brother is in Africa and steps on a landmine or is attacked (he is with a young child) and loses his leg. The brother returns home with one leg and they see the bird with one leg in the garden. The story was split in to part with titles like Hero's Journey or Emily's journey, I don't remember the exacts names but think the bird might have been called Hero.

That minister then is too proud to let his tail drag, so he tasks the next person in the chain of command to carry it. And so on, right down the line to the poorest little mouse in the kingdom. They were all following each other, carrying the next guy's tail. SPOILER: Finally, the last little mouse is fed up and slams down the tail of the person in front of him. That has a domino effect all the way up the line. And from that day forward, everyone carried his own tail. NOTE: This is not The King, The Mice and The Cheese. I have that book.

goodreads	23083158	1	Lauren	2025-04-05T00:00:00Z	I have been thinking about / trying to find this book for years and have never succeeded! I remember reading this book in fifth grade, so 2000-2001. I remember the cover being black and white with a girl/girl in profile on the cover. I remember the title being one word, I keep thinking it was the girl's name like Dixie or Ruby - it is possible I am misremembering the title and cover. The book takes place in the south, I feel like in the 1930's or 1940's. Main character is a girl, I think a tomboy, I don't quite remember her age...maybe 14ish? Girl lives in this southern town with her family, I think she has an older sister who is really beautiful and an older brother who is really quiet. There is a rich family in town with a Rich Son who is around the same age as the older sister and this guy is an ass. Really flashy, drives around in a fancy car, main character hates him. I think he is maybe creepy to the older sister as well. Rich Son ends up murdered and main character ends up on trial. Novel may jump back and forth in time from the trial to the time leading up to the murder. SPOILERS: Main character ends up getting off for the murder because the Rich Son was hit over the head with something really heavy (a paint can?) and lawyer proves during trial she wouldn't have been able to lift it over her head. I think main character was alone in a general store and Rich Son came upon her and attacked her, and then older brother found them both and killed the Rich Son by hitting him over the head.

goodreads	23083567	1	Prairie Milestone	2025-04-05T00:00:00Z	I dont remember the author or title but I remember some of the plot. I read it about 2 years ago now. It was a young adult thriller about a ritch kid who liked to go caving but when he goes into one of the caves it collapses on him and knocks him out. When he wakes up he finds that hes suspended above a huge drop and theres some kids on a ledge(4 of them I think-2 girls 2 boys) not to far from him that help him get over to safety. They soon realize they cant go out the way they came in and are forced to go deeper into the cave system to search for another way out. As the story goes on, the kids that helped him mysteriously die off one but one and the mmc is the only one to make it out alive. After he's out he tells the rescue people the names of the kids that were down there with him and it turns out that he had cave rapture and imagined the whole thing. But the IMPORTANT PART is that the main character had killed some kids in a car crash and those are the same kids he imagined in the cave. The kids died in the cave the same way they did in the car crash. Like one kid was impaled on a stalagmite in the cave and in the crash he was impaled by something like a pole/sign post or something. His family covered up the whole crash incident to protect him but after his whole experience he decides to go to court and own up to his mistakes and his part in their deaths. Im really bad with nanes so these could be wrong but i think some of the kids names were Kitt and Margaret/Marie or something like that. I've been looking for this book for weeks now and its starting to drive me a little crazy so I'd appreciate it so much if anyone could tell me the name of it. Thanks.

The protags were a boy and a girl, either in high school or college, and I believe they were friends at the beginning but there was a romance element as it developed. I feel like they were written notes they left for each other, not text messages or emails, but I could be mis-remembering. I read this book around 2004-2009 and assume it came out around then, but not sure. I think I remember it having a lime green cover with some sort of silhouetted person??

I believe it was a early chapter book for either 3/4/5 grade readers. Small tidbits I recall: --The girl was about pre-teen age. --Her parents may have been recently or in process of divorcing. --She did not want to go and had a bit of a time adapting. --There was a description early in the book about pine needles everywhere. --There was one scene in the book, it was the last day before Christmas vacation and four of the older girls in the school were dressed in white, carrying candles, wandering the halls of the dorm gently singing Christmas Carols to wake everyone up (instead of the typical bell/alarm). --I *think* there was part of the story that the head mistress had to go away and the assistant who was super nice replaced her. --I also remember a moment when the main character woke up and her furnace was on which was not typical and she appreciated waking up to a warm room instead of a cold one.

It focuses on the life of a young boy who is born blind (I think to white parents who are living in India temporarily, though I might have that confused.) They rapidly discover his hearing is insanely good when he sits by the door waiting for his dad to come home from work because he can hear the car. They then get him a guide dog, a golden retriever and some kind of household help / gardener teaches him how to train the dog to bite on command. They then get on a plane and it's hijacked, but the boy convinces them to bring the dog up from the hold. I remember the dog bites one of the hijackers on the arm. I think the boy also might be able to see through a wall at some point - though I don't remember how because he was definitely blind at the start of the book - and I think he is also stupidly strong and bends some metal maybe. I have a vague memory of the title involving the word Gold or Golden as I think the little boy was blonde, but I might be making that up.

I initially thought it was Radiant Darkness , but I'm currently in the middle of that one, and while I definitely also read it in that same time frame, it's missing a very specific scene that I distinctly remember from the book I'm looking for. In the scene, which was very early on-- if not the very first scene in the book-- Hades and Persephone are having a picnic. The two of them have been seeing each other behind Demeter's back for a while at this point, but Hades has been pretending to be an irrelevant minor god. He decides to come clean with Persephone, who admits to having figured out his true identity a while ago. I distinctly remember that while she was walking through her reasoning of how she'd tried to narrow down who he actually was, and she'd known he couldn't be Dionysus because he always left the wineskin in the basket.

goodreads	23089312	1	Erin	2025-03-27T00:00:00Z	I read this book in about 2015. In it, the main female lead is thought to be unattractive and her family tells her so. She is also not allowed much freedom at home. I think she was even only allowed to read books about nature written by one particular author. She gets a letter that tells her that she is dying so she decides to leave her family. She meets a man and lives a life away from her family and more in nature. She blossoms and becomes seen as beautiful. Even a famous painter who only paints beautiful women requests to paint her. Spoilers ahead! She falls in love with the man she met and learns that he is actually secretly the author of the nature books that she had enjoyed reading. She also almost gets run over by a train when her boot gets stuck in the railroad track and the male lead saves her life. The male lead realizes he loves her after she almost dies and vows to find a cure for her illness. In the end we learn that the letter that told her she was dying was sent in error and she isn't actually dying.

When the guardian/ward relationship was established, the friendship soured because she was resistant to the control over her given the new role. However, the male guardian still cared for her and tried to get back into good terms with her until eventually he succeeded. She even came to realize that what she once thought was a friendship was actually more romantic feelings. Thanks for the help :)

No mention of technology or even cars. But it is not set in any discernible time period. It's a female author and the book is pretty new, probably written within the last 5 years. It's about a woman who lives a pretty mundane life, working at a museum ( I think?) as a maid I believe. We follow her daily routine until she meets a man who asks her to marry him. She leaves her job and moves into his home. He has one maid that we rarely se and seems suspicious of the protagonist. Our protagonist spends her days in a room writing and her husband is away most if the time. She seems content in her solitude but bored. She eventually makes a new friend, a dancer. She goes to see her friend dance in a ballet and is very moved by the originality of her friend amongst the other dancers. Her friend has a day job somewhere and has been working hard to dance in this show on her time off. At some point the protagonist contemplates divorce but it seems impossible. So she devises a plan to trick her husband into sleeping with their maid so that she can catch them and file for divorce. She asks the maid if she'll agree without saying it outright. The maid seems disgusted and I think ends up leaving the house altogether. I have a hard time remembering the ending. But I think the protagonist eventually leaves him. The wiring is very spare and simple. But has a gothic style due to the winter season and grim everyday. I cannot for the life of me remember the title. It was something really simple, maybe just one word. Thanks for the help!

This is where I start regurgitating what I can remember about the plot so SPOILERS BELOW :) The party at the start was like a not so innocent kind of party and the FMC was about to kiss a guy as part of some game and then the MMC stopped it and dragged her out of there and was all like why are you here? This isn't your scene? And then I think they kissed and she freaked out and left. I can't remember much of the plot in the middle but I think the MMC wanted to see the FMC again and eventually she gave in but they kept it a secret. But he wanted to tell people and she didn't and that was creating tension? Now I'm not entirely sure why she wanted it to be a secret but maybe because her parents wouldn't approve? Or her friends wouldn't? Anyway, then they went to some party that was at some important person's house and then the party got busted and everyone found out that they had been seeing each other and the MMC basically said he can't be with her when she doesn't know what she wants. They must have made up because the next thing I remember is the FMC is talking to some guy in a restaurant - could be an ex? Or like someone her parents set her up with? But he was like the opposite of the MMC and I think she was rejecting him? And then the MMC shows up and things get heated and the MMC and this guy are fighting and then the FMC joins in to defend the MMC. And then they end up in jail and her parents comes to bail them out? And then I think the parents are rude to the MMC because the FMC walks out with the MMC and I think that was the end? Honestly I feel like I might have combined 2 books but hopefully some of these plot points can help us figure out the book haha. Please feel free to comment any books you think fit the description! Thanks so much!!! :))))

I searched on Google, Google books, goodreads, tiktok and random other websites and couldn't find it but I went on worldcat and found it in like 5 minutes. I literally searched """"college romance, georgia"""" because I was like 60% sure the FMC's name was Georgia (which it is luckily) and 150 results came up which I thought would be easy to search through, but it was only like the 20th search result anyway. Moral of the story is: worldcat for the win! It would probably not be that hard to find a book on other websites if you know the main character's name but problem was when I would search """"college romance, georgia"""" everywhere else, it would show me romances IN Georgia which was completely useless, or worse, books with Georgia in the title which was even more useless. So I guess worldcat is less literal with it lol, if you search something like """"Georgia"""" it will do more than just a surface level search.

The covers feature the current species focused in the book The alien guy is really cool but heâs got mad anger problems and his specific race has to deal with their âRageâ in the form of violence or fucking.

She and the alien guy end up flirting and itâs amazing.

Some of the poems and artwork were very small, multiple to a page, but others took up the full two-page spread. the art was fairly photorealistic, not cartoony, even the ones of fictional creatures Here are the contents of some of the poems: -Disobedience-A. A. Milne, it had a full page spread of a little boy looking directly at the reader, holding his mother's hand while they waited to cross the street -a poem about a little girl who lost her straw hat, it floats down a river and she finds it later when she gets to where she was going. the picture of the hat had a blue ribbon -a picture of a little kid painting a fence purple -The Purple Cow-Gelett Burgess -how much wood would a woodchuck chuck? -a picture of a dragon, and I think it was meant to be the narrator's dad? there were many more, it had quite a bit of content for a children's poetry book, but unfortunately I can't remember much else. The book itself was hardcover, and I think light in colour. I said it was from before 2006, but it seemed older than that based on aesthetics

I read it when I was a kid in the 80's, so had to have been pulbished before 1990. This one scene has always stuck with me, and I'm hoping some other avid reader out there might remember it too! The protaganist (kid? boy?) is in a group of adults up to no good, and he knows they just served him a cup of tea with a sleeping potion secretly added into it. So he pretends to drink it, then fakes """"falling asleep"""" so they'll be fooled into thinking the kid is genuinely out cold. There's a long silence in the room, then one of the adults laughs and says something like """"boy we sure must've added way more sedative into that drink then normal!"""" and so the hero's ruse ended up working. So random! Can anyone remember the title of this 80's kids book?"

He basically slides completely out of their memory as soon as they stop paying attention to him. Around the beginning of the book, after this boy is introduced, a girl is transported from her own, modern world to the boy's, near a ship run by a wizard, and they both end up on the same voyage for the item, on that ship. The girl can remember the boy. That's about all I can remember from the first book. The second book has them stuck in a place unstuck in time, and they face an enemy that is after the same thing as them. After some amount of time, (I'm not sure whether its near the end or not) the girl also forgets the boy, and leaves him behind somewhere?				
goodreads	23098678	1	Charles Hays	2025-04-05T00:00:00Z	I think I listened to the audio book just prior to 2020 and it seemed like it had been written fairly recently. I *think* there were at least two books in a series but I don't remember. I'm not 100% sure the girls are twins, but like 90% sure. The girls get separated and much of the story is about them trying to reunite. The chapters alternate from the focus of one girl to the other - but not first person I think - just the chapters are about one girl at a time. The story takes place in the near not quite dystopian future in a place like the USA - they have cars. The twin girls are teenagers and I think their parents died. The people in power (I'm not sure it's a government) recommend euthanasia for at least one of the girls but she refused. One of the supporting characters is boy whose father is high up in the ruling class. He kind of alternates between an enemy and an ally. At one point in the story one of the girls is captured, held prisoner with other teenagers, and forced to learn fighting in some kind of resistance or military group. One detail I remember is one of the twins is in a car accident with the boy she likes - they hit a deer or moose or something and the antlers come through the windshield and pin the boy to the seat and they have to use the car's jack to push the deer off of him. Another detail is one of the twins and another character are going through books and DVDs from the past trying to research. They find a Forrest Gump DVD, although the name is not mentioned. They describe it as a documentary about a man who fights in a war, plays ping pong, and runs across the country. Or something like that. That's all I've got for now. :) I want to find it and read/listen to it again. :) Thanks!				audiobook

This is a science fiction book. The main story follows a telepathic boy who hides his abilities as they are feared and killed if discovered. A man befriends him who wants to tear down the society they live in. A society in which the elites live on a world covered in cities where the more important you are the longer you can live by using a drug to temporarily die and be put into a state of suspended animation. Your mind is copied and saved and reloaded when they bring you back to life. The empress lives the longest only being awakened for a single day every century. Later the telepath accidentally creates a world of strong telepaths who watch over the human race and create a utopia where nobody dies or gets sick or feels pain. Theme of the book is about how utopia stagnates man and we need to struggle to survive to truly be alive and grow as a species.	unusable			too many books in the answer OP confirms

The description mentions chickens, eggs and sulphur, but not a character called 'Tyco Brahay' (Tycho Brahe?). If this is not it, this is the first of a series of 6 books, so the others may be worth investigating.

goodreads	23100023	1	Joel Osten	2025-04-05T00:00:00Z	Hello, first time poster, looking for a suspense novel from long ago, here is the plot summary and details: I read this book in the late 1980s or early 1990s. In Canada but likely published simultaneously in the U.S., likely American publisher. It was a suspense/thriller/mystery novel possibly for young adults. Plot: Dark and stormy night when several teenagers are driving home in a van during a rainstorm. The vehicle breaks down and the teens spot an old house up on a hill barely lit. They approach the house in the dark and manage to enter it. Once inside, they find it very dark, no power/lights. They come to the realization that they are not alone, there is a killer in the house that can see them and follow them, trapping them one by one. Suddenly the remaining teens realize that they can remove their outerwear leaving only their theater garments on, all black clothing including netted face mask and hoods, so the killer now cannot see them, and they can move freely as they become accustomed to the dark. In the end, one or a few either escape or catch the killer. **If anyone can determine this book and title, I would like to read it again! The author did a great job making it suspenseful and scary!----Joel

goodreads	23102726	1	Chrissie	2025-05-05T00:00:00Z	I think I read this between 2004-2008. The book was about a haunted house. An evil woman ghost lived there and I believe she kept killing the childern that live in the house. I think in total there were four victims - two boys, two girls, one teenager and one young kid of each gender. A new family moved in and the ghost childern are trying to stop the current child of the family from meeting the same fate. I remember there was this brutal scene of the adult ghost grabbing the ghost children and suctioning their life force. The reason why she kept needing to kill the childern was to keep living by stealing their life forces. I also recall the childern using wind drafts to move around faster! Thank you!

It was a kid's chapter book, maybe middle-grade, about a Jewish(?) girl, whose family moves (or visits a relative?) in a new apartment. Story takes place in the summertime. She makes a reference to the children's book Madeline, stating how Madeline found a crack on the ceiling that looked like a rabbit. However, when she looks on the ceiling of her new apartment, she finds cracks and mildew stains, but no rabbit. She makes a friend: a girl her age, who she invites into her apartment. The girl lets her wear her cross necklace. When her mother sees the cross necklace on her neck, she gets upset. Her apartment building has a pool, and her relative encourages her to go swimming. But when she was younger, she almost drowned, and has been scared of water ever since. However when her little brother falls into the pool and almost drowns she jumps in to save him. The little brother is hospitalized, and when the family visits they bring electric candles (because the hospital did not allow real candles) and pray for him.

goodreads	23103048	1	Emily Gee	2025-04-27T00:00:00Z	"Hi there ... I'm trying to track down a book that I read in the mid-to-late 90s (or possibly in the very, very, very early 2000s). It features a female investigator in what I remember as being Regency England, but may possibly be Victorian England. As I recall -- the protagonist was ruined (I don't remember why) and was (possibly) living out the back of a high class brothel. But she wasn't a prostitute herself. Also -- she often wore male clothes. Also -- spoiler -- the protagonist fell for a man (possibly a politician) in the book, but he turned out to be the murderer. The fatal clue was potpourri caught in his trouser cuff. (Trouser cuffs makes me think it was Victorian, not Regency, but it could be that I'm misremembering and it was a turned-up hem or a pocket.) Also -- at the beginning of the book, while walking through town (London?) she came to the aid of a prostitute who was being assaulted by a man who (I think) likened """"using"""" the prostitute to using a chamberpot/privy for bodily functions. (Unless I'm mixing books up and this happened in a completely different book...) Also -- the series only ran to (I think) 2 or 3 books because the author died young. I want to say from cancer? I also have a strong feeling that the author's name was Octavia or Olivia, but am most likely wrong because I am dreadful with names. But I think, when I initially found the book in the library, that I didn't realize the author was female, so maybe the author's Christian name was in initials? """"O"""" something? (But like I said, quite likely not an O name and I've got that wrong.) I recommended this book/series to a friend recently, but can't locate it at all despite wide internet searches.

goodreads	23103643	1	Jessica Holcomb	2025-04-27T00:00:00Z	Hello. I read this book, possibly in college or high school, so around 2008-2010 and the mail order bride was for the son, ordered by his now deceased father, who I think the bride knew and actually answered a letter to come west. It was under false pretenses. The father also had an affair with the Hispanic maid, who bore the half-brother of the son, but they were best friends but kept their ancestry secret, but the widow knew. The widow was, a stick in the mud and very rude and mean to the maid, and basically everyone. She also had an affair with someone who kept the books for the ranch, I think. I think he ended up killing her and then committing suicide or something because he calls her out on not loving him when he loved her with everything but she never showed ANY affection to him, and it actually explains that she was told as a young woman to never do anything with her husband but lay there, and I remember there being a description in the book about how her areola were still pink, even though sheâs had a kid. There was a fire involved I believe. I remember the fact that she was a mail order bride upset the son, considering he didnât want to be married, and there was a rather, eh, scene where ranch life was present in a conversation of castrating a bull. There was also a shooting contest and something about not all five chambers having bullets but the sonâs gun did have all six loaded because he shot at another dude who was basically salivating at his wife. I also remember that the woman the father loved was killed, and some man was obsessed with the mail order bride and kidnapped her actually, but she was able to get away, I think and she was pregnant as well. I also remember that the mail order bride either got sick due to taking care of a new mother and her child, which was the half-brotherâs wife and there was birthing complications as well, but it all worked out in the end. I think she may have delivered twins actually. However the son took his wifeâs ribbon from her chemise and she discovered it and she was moved. Any help is greatly appreciated. I loved reading this book and it had so much to it.

She ends up going to NY to tell him about the baby I guess. NY guy comes from a very rich family and they donât really like her at first. NY guy has a brother also and I think they go into business together in one of the subsequent books buying a club or restaurant of some sort. The other books in the series follow the other peopleâs POVs. In one of them Alex starts dating a French teacher I think. I think Bridget and NY guy move back to Australia at some point.

I think the title has something to do with fairies or wishes or fireflies. Like the mom told her that fireflies are fairies or something. But itâs not fantasy.

goodreads	23104427	1	Pony Xaviors	2025-05-05T00:00:00Z	Hey all! I'm trying to remember the name of a book I never quite finished. I got it from my library and started reading it sometime between 2014 - 2019, but I was super busy with college classes at the time and didn't get the chance to finish it before it was due. I've always wanted to finish it, but for some reason I almost immediately forgot the title of it after I returned it and haven't been able to find it again. It was a Young Adult novel, most likely published in the U.S. It was a thriller/mystery. What I remember about it: The protagonist was a teenaged boy (I think high school age). He was gay and the book started off explaining how a year ago (I believe it was a year), his male best friend, whom he had secretly had a crush on, had been murdered. I remember that the protagonist had some other friends, one of them I think was a girl. I think they had all been friends with the guy who had died. I'm not positive, but I think their friend had been one of multiple teenagers who had been murdered the previous year, but I don't think the killer had been caught. I'm pretty sure the book was about the murders starting up again, but I don't know for sure because I didn't get that far. I just think the summary may have said something about that. I also remember the protagonist living near water, I think possibly the ocean? It may have been a coastal town. Oh! And I feel like the protagonist had lived next door to his friend that got killed, or maybe to one of their other friends. I remember something about him looking through a window or someone climbing through a window. I also remember something about him finding a note that was somehow related to the night his friend died (I think he found it in a book or textbook he had borrowed), which started him up again having questions about solving the murder. And I know part way though the book, he meets another guy (I feel like he was a little bit older), that he starts to fall for. Anyway, that was as far as I got in the story before I had to return it. Any help is appreciated! Thanks in advance!

The cover had an otter/beaver's eye with possibly a camera shutter as the iris (might be misremembering the camera shutter but it was definitely a striking eye). Photography was also a theme that stuck out to me as a major character trait of one of the main characters. Main characters are aged around 10-13. Read in early-mid 2000s. Likely written in late 90s/early 2000s. I think the author was a woman. My memory of this book is very hazy, I read it when I was a child, but I've made half-hearted attempts to find it over the years. Left an impression on me as a child and I'm interested to see what I'd make of it as an adult. Any help or suggestion is appreciated.

I donât think it was really early in the 1900âs. The protagonist is a young girl about 8 to 11 years old. The story is set in the United States in a small town, maybe in Ohio, and begins in the year 1900. The girl and her grandfather are planning to celebrate the next New Yearâs Eve when it will become 1901 because they know that that is when the true beginning of the twentieth century will begin, not 1900 as everyone else thinks. The girl has an uncle who is sad because he recently broke off an engagement with a woman he believes did not really love him. His name may be Edward. The girl goes ice skating on the pond in the middle of town and meets a beautiful young woman. She tells the girl to call her Fairy Child. The young womanâs name is really Miss Fairchild. It turns out that Miss Fairchild is really the ex-fiancÃ©e of the girlâs uncle. When the uncle finds out that Miss Fairchild has befriended the girl, the uncle and the rest of the family are angry, believing that Miss Fairchild is using the girl to get back together with the uncle. Miss Fairchild gives the girl something and it allows the girl to find out the truth about something. When the girl solves that mystery, it leads to the uncle and Miss Fairchild resuming their relationship. The assassination of President William McKinley is mentioned.

goodreads	23106929	1	Sam Stockton	2025-04-27T00:00:00Z	I read this book around 2013-2015. Specifically, I had purchased the audiobook CDs from Indigo, so it was popular enough to have an audiobook made and sold in a mainstream Canadian store. (SPOILERS AHEAD) - The protagonist is a single woman - She has a somewhat strained relationship with her mother who was a bit unpredictable in her youth - She had either never met her father or he had left her when they were very young - She receives some kind of correspondence which leads her to travel away from her home and meet her father - There is something related to an inheritance and it is expected that she will inherit a house, which annoys the siblings/cousins she has just met - At some point they require her mother to be physically present, at which point the protagonist reveals that her mother gave up her wilds ways to become a nun who lives in an off-the-grid convent Honestly, some of the details might be shaky, but I VIVIDLY remember the reveal of her mother being a nun. It was a big plot twist in the story.	unusable			looking for an audiobook
goodreads	23106929	2	Sam Stockton	2025-04-27T00:00:00Z	Adding: - The book is contemporary, not historical fiction - It might not be her father she meets, but another man in her family (like a grandfather or uncle). I feel like itâs her father she meets, but I could be misremembering. Potentially it could be that her father died and she is meeting a different older, male relative.	unusable

Kid was living in a hotel room with his pregnant mom, and she ends up missing one day so the kid is panicking. Big scene about hotel staff pounding on the door and eventually the kid runs out of food or decides to just leave - talks to a homeless man on a park bench and is maybe being followed by someone? Not sure on the following but definitely a sense of panic and urgency as he goes along his solo journey. I remember the cover being sort of beige and impressionist - fuzzy, just like this memory lol. <<<<< (view spoiler) [>>>>>>I don't remember how but kid is reunited with his mom and the end and meets his new sibling.

goodreads	23107087	1	Jo	2025-05-05T00:00:00Z	So Iâve been looking for this book for years after I read it a bunch in 8th grade but I somehow never remembered the name. I remember the basic plot and one name. Spoilers below for the plot. So basically this girl(the main character) lives in the small town thatâs really like backwards. Itâs set in modern times but this town still lives like itâs in the 50âs or something like that. I believe she knows someone that gets attacked or hit by a car(or maybe killed?) but then she is hit by a car but lives. After waking up in the hospital she realizes that she can see how people die when she looks at them. She gets close with this guy named Nate who was either a guy from her school or an old childhood friend that sheâd drifted apart from(not too sure) but they grow closer as they try to figure out who is attacking/killing people until they become a couple towards the end of the book. I remember that at some point Nate confronts who they believe the murderer to be but she sees when she looks at Nate that the murderer will kill Nate with a knife so she tries to intervene. Towards the end I think the murderer kidnaps her because heâs obsessed with her but is eventually caught when Nate comes to save her. The main characters were high school students and I read it in middle school so itâs almost definitely a YA book. The name I remembered above is Nate which Iâm pretty sure was short for Nathaniel for this character(the name could be inaccurate tho so the plot is more important).

goodreads	23108067	1	Erin S	2025-05-05T00:00:00Z	First read around 2010-2015 but the book itself could have been a little older, checked out from my local library (I live in the US). Iâve searched the libraryâs catalogue and done extensive online searching with no luck! The cover might be blue, but I could be misremembering. Plot: A girl named Harper (her mom named her after Harper Lee) was raised by a single mother somewhere around the East Coast who will only tell her that her dad died in the war (pretty sure it was the Vietnam War, but that detail is iffy). She starts trying to learn more about her dad. She is also friends with a girl (Iâm pretty sure they were in middle school) and her brother who live nearby, possibly in a motel, and I remember a specific scene in the book of the two girls attending a dance class together when they were little. SPOILERS: Harper finds her birth certificate hidden in her momâs things and Iâm pretty sure her birth name wasnât Harper. Near the end of the book, Harper and her girl friend go on a school field trip to Washington DC and Harper tries to find her dadâs name on a war memorial but canât find it. Her dad is actually alive and her mother was trying to hide her from him. I think the book ends with Harper disappearing to either search for or go live with her dad and the friend doesnât see her again.

I believe I purchased it a scholastic book fair in the late 90's - it had a modern feel. So I don't think it was a Blume or Cleary. It had a predominantly purple or dark pink cover. Nothing about the name of the book is clear to me. The main plot revolved around the evolving and tragically difficult time of middle school (possibly freshman year) female friendships. RE: everyone sucked. Even the main character at times. It was all very innocent and modest in content. I'm sure there was crushing and fighting over a boy (I'd have ate that stuff up as a kid) but I'm unsure. THE ONLY thing I remember for SURE - is that the main character had a school project at some point where they had to fill a box (or something) with items that represented themselves. She left the box empty (or a part of it empty) to represent the part of her she hasn't yet become. (Dear god, I hope this isn't actually just AYTGIMM - and I'm a total loser.)

Read it in the 90's in the school library. Early in the book, probably at the beginning, the high school boy goes to some sort of office - probably the nurses office at achool or a doctor's office, and i think it's there he meets the girl. She's younger than him, maybe by a few grades? She's portrayed as mostly quiet, not really talkative, but not mean or anything. Swveral times her smile is mentioned as being a really small smile, like you can barely tell when she smiles. The high school guy is kinda delinquent, i feel like he had some illness or condition that contributed to his school absenteeism, but I'm not poaitive on that. The main stand-out thing about him is that he has an imaginary friend (or imaginary alter ego?) That he calls """"Bear"""" who is stronger, braver, more protective than him. It turns out that the girl is some sort of central figure in a (faith-healing?) Cult. It's not her choice or doing, other people are propping her up as a messiah or miracle or what have you. It feels like they're using her. The high school guy goes to the cult meetings cause he feels like the girl might need his help. I'm not sure what happens after that. Never got to continue reading the book. It was in my high school library in the 90's, i came across it in my late teens and it seemed age appropriate. It's in English, and was vaguely close in feel to Christopher Pike books. Not exactly like him. I don't think it was him. But it definitely felt like young adult material."

The main city was tierd and had a giant greenhouse or smokehouse where meat was cured which had an almost addictive taste. The beasts that were cured could be found wild and traveled to the end of the world which was hidden by mists. The hero had to navigate a swampland to find it where he eventually found himself in another world. The hero was also pursued by a villain who I believe was a shadow figure.

goodreads	23111080	1	Daniel Sterman	2025-05-05T00:00:00Z	"I read this book when I was around 10 years old, in the mid-90s. It will have been meant for somebody that age or maybe slightly older. The book was written in American English and probably published within the previous five or ten years. I do not remember anything about the book physically (color, size, etc.), but I feel like it was probably softcover and novelette-length. The main character, a boy around the age of 10 or 12, begins to believe that his sister was an accomplice to a murder committed by her boyfriend. He somehow stumbles onto a private investigator, who agrees to look into it for free. The private investigator regularly meets his clients in secret in some diner or ice cream store or some such. At one point the investigator tells the kid over the phone to meet him at the regular place, and the kid begins to say """"oh, you mean the one at-"""" and the investigator snaps at him """"Don't broadcast it, kid!"""" because the PI's line is tapped by the police. Unfortunately the kid managed to mention enough of the name of the diner that the detective assigned to follow the PI around figured it out. The kid's last name is something like Boyd, which proves to be just an excuse for the author to have the private investigator tell a police detective (or vice versa) that """"a little Boyd told me"""". ALMOST ALL THE DETAILS I REMEMBER ARE SPOILERS: At the end, all of the kid's evidence for the murder, which he wrote down in a notebook of clues to bring the PI, turns out to have been a series of wacky misunderstandings. Here are the ones I remember: * He overheard his sister and her boyfriend talking about """"that little murder between us"""", which turned out to be the title of a play they were auditioning for or acting in. * He found a bucket of water with what he thought was the victim's head submerged in it. (I remember the line the kid wrote in the notebook being something along the lines of """"There is a HEAD in a bucket"""", with """"head"""" in all caps.) This turned out to be the wig the sister was planning to wear in the play, which she was soaking in water because it had gotten dirty. * He overheard his sister crying in pain and her boyfriend threatening her, which turned out to be the boyfriend telling her to hold still while trying to help her put on the now-painfully-shrunken wig. However, the private investigator knew it was a misunderstanding from the start, and was in fact using the kid to unravel a series of thefts that were committed by the kid's family's housekeeper, who changes identities all the time and robs from her employers and may or may not be the head of a massive thieving ring of similar housekeepers. I don't remember how the PI realized the two plots are connected."

In the end, a woman visiting the cemetery sees the freshly dug grave with the unusual """"vase"""" and feels sorry that the graves has no flowers.

I believe it was part of a series and the events I've specified in the title happen in one of the sequels. Title could have had silk/spice road in it. The protagonist is given the ability to travel to the magical land by the genie. In fact, I think the genie requests that she does to complete some kind of mission perhaps? yes, there's a magic carpet involved and it has the personality traits of a dog. She also has a magic bottomless everything bag she uses. The protagonist's friend asks to come as well and the protag asks the genie's permission for this. The genie reluctantly agrees. During the adventure (which I unfortunately can't remember much about), the friend manages to do something bad (maybe stole jewelery or was accused of stealing) which the protag smooths over, but I think that ends the friendship or something. There isn't much else I remember about the plot sadly. The cover had two girls in the foreground, in blue (blonde girl?) and red (brunette girl) t-shirts I think, and the genie in the background. The main colour palette of the background was yellow. I have searched for so long, but there are so many books out there with FMCs and genies. No matter how imaginative my searches, they have been fruitless. Please help.

While Megan was away at music camp, Cyn was exploring the magical worlds of Atlantis and Xanadu with the powerful genie, King Sinbad. But when Cyn tries to tell her best friend about her adventures, Megan is more interested in showing off her new hairstyle and clothes. That is, until she steals the genie's enchanted ring and summons King Sinbad for herself ... The genie grants Megan a wish, but not the kind she was hoping for. He banishes her to Circe's island, where she is mistaken for a slave and forced to serve the wicked sorceress. Cyn can't leave her best friend in danger. Together, she and the flying carpet set out on a perilous journey of rescue to the Magic Isles and beyond, along the silken road to the ancient city of Samarkand.

I think this book is part of batch of linked standalones, but not sure. MFC is commissioned to paint a portrait of a peer of the realm wife (Don't remember his rank). When she arrives to consult, she finds out that the wife has actually been dead for sometime, and the man (crazy man) locks her in a room until she can get the portrait complete. MMC is either poor or not a first son, but has nowhere to go, so he plays unpaid companion to the albino son of the crazy man. He discovers the girl while putting out rat traps due to the sounds he has heard her making. He frees her to come to the rooms he and the son use (servants stairs or secret passages) The albino son isn't allowed to leave the house because he is a """"disgrace"""" to his father. He is weaker, but not a true invalid. He also makes figurines from wood. (Spoilers) they all get free at the end when the portrait reveal angers the crazy man and a house fire results. That's most of what I remember. Other minor memory : MFC borrows a green dress that belonged to the wife for the painting. I don't recall MFC's life circumstances that lead to her not being missed during her imprisonment. Nor do I recall any of the character's names right now. Thanks for any help!"

goodreads	23116754	1	J.A. Enfield	2025-05-05T00:00:00Z	"1980s (ish) Middle Grade/YA urban fantasy about a boy protagonist who creates a clunky angel sculpture that comes to life Middle-Grade or YA Urban fantasy (though I don't think that term existed at the time the book was published). Country of Publication: United States Language: English (at least, that's what I read it in and I suspect that was the original language) I read this book in the 1980s or early 1990s. Most likely it was the mid- to late 1980s. Note: This book is NOT Ray Bradbury's The Halloween Tree. I tried a bunch of AI searches before posting this, and when the AI weren't hallucinating, they kept suggesting The Halloween Tree. As I remember it, the bookâs mood was often ominous, even quietly menacing. As best I can remember, the book was set in a large U.S. city, probably New York City. I think the setting was roughly contemporary with the book's publication. The protagonist was a youngish boy, maybe 10 years old. For reasons that might have involved Halloween, he found or created a statute of an angel. I think the sculpture was made from odds and ends, and I seem to remember that a barrel featured prominently in its composition. The angel sculpture came to life and became an important character and motive force in the book. I think the protagonist had to conceal it from his parents (caregivers?). The angel might have been named """"Mike"""" or """"Michael"""" (possibly after the archangel). I also think (?) that at some point a Frankenstein's monster-ish sculpture came to life and may have been named """"Frank."""" This was a physical book (paperback, I think) found in a brick and mortar bookstore in the U.S. I vaguely recollect that it was published by Scholastic, but I could easily be wrong on that point. I think the author had a male name, though I could also be wrong about that."

It was a gritty first person POV from a teen girl who had run away from home and met with other homeless teens who looked out for each other somewhere in America. Specific plot points I remember: (spoilers ahead!) There were three brothers that she meets and stays with in this homeless teen enclave (a squat maybe?), one was just a little kid. The oldest told a story about their dad beating the kid brother very badly. He may have retaliated and hurt the dad at that point. They were possibly Italian American - I seem to remember names like Francesca and Toni/Tony, but that hasn't helped me in my Google searches There was definitely romantic tension between the oldest brother and the narrator but can't remember if they ever got together. It was revealed that the narrator left home after her brother killed himself (possibly because he was gay?) The above was revealed because she was having nightmares and saying his name in her sleep. The oldest brother confronts her, thinking she's remembering a traumatic event. He says """"What did that bastard do to you?"""" and she replies """"He killed himself! That bastard was my brother."""" Something tragic happens near the end, like one of the teens dying or getting arrested The novel finishes with the narrator reflecting on all that's happened and the last line is something like """"Have to write it down so we do not forget."""" The cover might have had an illustrated girl with reddish brown hair on the front in a denim jacket, looking tough"

Plot revolves around an alien invasion occurring over many years and they have built permanent structures around the planet, especially in Antarctica and I believe China and Gibraltar. The aliens are collecting humans, predominantly in China at the start under the guise of work, and testing their genetics using special bells. There is a underlying conspiracy plot where a secret organisation is trying to cover this up and help the aliens. There are a few main characters. One is a man investigating the secret organisation. There's also a women who has got the alien genes and I think she was a scientist of some sorts and knows the main alien (from a past life or something). I can't remember why the aliens are invading. There is some time spent in space in the later books. I think the story ends at the Gibraltar facility. I read these books in the early 2000's.	unusable

I read it probably 2017-2019 Hereâs what I remember: The female main character used to be a stripper, but she now works at a bar in the city. The bar is described as the only one in the city that still has live music. Her boyfriend also works at the bar, but he doesnât own it, and heâs not abusive. One night, a man walks into the bar and recognizes her from her stripping days. Heâs a wealthy tech startup CEO, and he makes her a proposition: heâll pay her for a week or a month to be with him. It wasnât a super dark or taboo storyâmore of a âmid-darkâ romance in tone. I remember reading it on Amazon Kindle. If anyone recognizes this, Iâd be incredibly grateful.

I think I read it back around 2012-2014, and the cover had a blue background and black lettering. The plot was definitely a puzzle hunt mystery, with each step uncovering a new letter (for some reason I specifically recall S, W, O, T, I, F) as solved by a boy and a girl (maybe they were cousins?). I feel like their names were Peter and Fiona or something kind of like that, and some element of the mystery may have involved the girlâs uncle and some kind of fountain in a park (Iâm pretty sure the letters they found helped make sense of a message written in the fountain thing). Iâm pretty sure this was a series too, as I remember there being more people involved in the second book and even a dog they find trapped in the puzzle dimension.

One of them involved finding a box in a cluttered room on the basis of a clue that I think said something like âpygmean coffret demesneâ. Another one involved the main character going on some monkey bars through some kind of windy space. And a third had a bunch of giant tiles you could stand on that spelled out some kind of rebus.

goodreads	23123714	1	Sabiha Younus	2025-05-06T00:00:00Z	I found this book in the Deep Vellum bookstore in Dallas, Texas in October 2024, so it was probably published (probably recently) either by Deep Vellum or another indie press. I believe it was a cream coloured hardcover of slightly squarish dimensions (different from the conventional hardcover shape) about $35 USD and had a large fashionably dressed full-body black and white protograph of an Asian woman in the front, back, flaps or even possibly endpapersâIâm unsure where the image was! It may have been a Korean author and characters, and it might have been a book in translation from the original language. Alternatively, it may also have been by an Asian American author (possibly a local author) and originally in EnglishâI am not sure. It was a sapphic (ie women-loving-women or f/f) novel about women in the photography and modeling (possibly dance as well) industry, who either had a competitive relationship or a complicated history. It was probably set in contemporary times, and probably in the literary fiction genre with a romance or identity focus. I looked through Deep Vellumâs website but I canât appear to identify it or tell if itâs there! Thanks!

goodreads	23124285	1	JB	2025-05-05T00:00:00Z	This one is driving me crazy. This is a middle-grade fiction book about a boy whose family chickens turn to stone, and then his dad does too after getting drunk and falling asleep in the chicken coop. Eventually the main character and I think his sister talk to their neighbor, a scientist, who tells them about this (radioactive?) element ardium (fictional! Not radium!) thatâs on their property. The boy and the girl end up sort of getting trapped in this rocky area with a lot of the element, but they figure out you can reverse the petrifaction with heat, so they like rub down their dadâs legs to un-paralyze him. I really feel like the title was something along the lines of âthe hole in the wallâ or âthe rock in the wallâ, but nothing comes up for either of those. Also I read this book around 2012-2015 and the cover may have been white with brown lettering?

It could have possibly been an adaption or homage to """"Journey to the Center of the Earth"""" with more fantastical and steampunk elements. I think I distinctly remember an airship.

She thinks her boyfriend Chase is acting suspicious so she follows him one day and finds out that he and his father are KU KLUX KLAN members. But Chase decides that he doesn't want to be a KKK boy but when he tells his father, the dad beats him up. There is a also a character name I remember called Gus. I believe he was the grandfather or uncle of the girl and he was either killed by something else or a KKK member in the past. I also remember that the girl's mother liked living the fast life and she does visits her daughter sometime in the book.

Any help is appreciated! The FMC joined the cult as a young girl because her mother experienced some sort of trauma. The cult leader has them living in a compound with tall walls, and they are not allowed to interact with outsiders. She had a problem with breaking rules and gets in trouble a lot. I can't remember if she is kicked out or if she leaves, but she goes to live with her Aunt in, I want to say, California. She moves into her aunt's RV and is readjusting to life when a viral disease breaks out. I believe it causes people to either act like zombies or become violent in some way. Her younger sister shows up at her RV with the key to the cure. She then begins a cross-country trek to a research facility. She is joined along the way by a man with whom she has a romance. He is either ex-military or some other kind of survivalist. At some point, they sleep in a truck or car overnight. I cannot remember any other details at the time, but I will update if I can. Thank you to anyone who can help!!

He meets a girl and she wants to take the potion too. I feel like I remember them sitting under a tree and talking about it.

There is also a moment in the story where they are in Denver, Colorado, although the story begins on the east coast somewhere. I think that they walk through New York City at some point as well.

The cover is what I remember the most. A photo of teen boy and a teen girl, possibly in an embrace. He had long brown hair and i think was wearing a leather jacket. The premise of the book was the girl experiences her first transformation into a warewolf. I don't remember how she was bit, and i kind of remember her feeling weird while sitting in her bedroom in the days coming up to the full moon. At some point she meets a boy who's been a werewolf for awhile, and i believe he was watching her because he was drawn to her. In the second book they run away to the woods, and stay in a cabin. Somehow the boy gets injured really bad, and she has to nurse him. The book ends with an open plot for a third book, but i don't know if a third ever came out.

This other world provides both monsters and dog-like companions to certain humans. These people are randomly selected and are recruited by the government to fight the monsters, which is filmed. This is sent out to the populous as entertainment and the special people with their dog-like companions are kind of like celebrity. The main character is a woman who originated from a mountain area. She fought monsters there for a bit before going to the more populous area that had worse monsters. The fighters are supplied with training but also special outfits with their own color schemes/brands, so it looks better on television. She starts with five dog-like companions but ends up with more after one of her opponentsâ companions abandon him because he was dishonorable by cheating in a contest against her with a laser. Other random details: -one of the men she knew was religious and she made fun of his idea of modesty -standard food was lab made and if you wanted real meat it was a luxury good -she wrote about how her dogs were not true black, they were the darkest shade of gray, which is the true color of shadows I donât remember any names or anything about the appearance of the book unfortunately.

I remember reading parts of the 2nd book in the early 10s and it had a woman with a white dress on the cover. Fantasy world similar to The Black Company Series by Glen Cook. Other things: - The story takes place in a completely fictional world, with a medieval vibeâno modern tech or connections to Earth. - There were Viking-like raiders (might have just been called raiders). - There was a sorcerer or wizard imprisoned in a cold, icy place, possibly a castle of ice. His imprisonment was important to the larger plot. - Somehow related to him is a mysterious woman (possibly a goddess or an enchantress) who could make people fall in love with her. She ends up being sold to a king and is frustrated because her wet nurse bears a child for the king in her place. - There was a village raid scene where all of the women were kidnapped, including one of the protagonists (named Katna?). Her friend returns from a hunt to find the village destroyed and an old crone who gives him a sword which ties into the backstory. -The book had multiple POVs and changed perspectives pretty often, not leaving us with one character for very long.	unusable			book series

goodreads	23128178	1	Reader	2025-05-12T00:00:00Z	I must have read this book some time in the early 2000s. The protagonist is a holocaust survivor who finds out that one of his torturers is alive. He turns out to be one of the telepaths in the group mentioned in the topic. It was interesting because it posited that the ability to read minds and force people to do what you want would naturally turn you into a sociopathic monster. There was also a subplot involving a telepath that gets put into a coma and finds out that it makes her even more powerful than she already was. Thanks for any help you can give me to remember the title. I've been trying to remember it for a week to recommend to a friend of mine.

goodreads	23128439	1	Felicity Rattray	2025-05-13T00:00:00Z	I read this book between 2-5 years ago. The book is split into two different view points. The build up to the death and what the journalist discovers. The journalist comes back from leave after something disturbing happens to her. Her boss sends her to a small town where this wealthy families daughter was murdered (her dad is a lawyer) to write a story about what happens. The journalist becomes friendly with local cafe owner who she goes on walks with to try and help heal her past (she canât walk by herself during the early hours of the morning). The journalist becomes friends with I think another police officer where they try investigate quietly as the case was closed shut. The girl who was murdered was at University/College and she had 3 friends. They were studying law. The girl who was murdered became close with one of the guys in the group. They would stay up late, talking through the early hours of the morning. She gave him flirty vibes but he wasnât sure and had a big crush on her. He thinks that the other two friends (M and F) are in a relationship. The main young girl turns out to be in a relationship with the other guy and it is all a big secret. After a bit of time the main young girl gets pregnant and freaks out as her dad is a top lawyer and her family have high hopes for her. She freaks out with school and family and they both decide to go to her family Bach in the small town over the Christmas holidays to tell her parents together. He ends up proposing to her to try and show how he is committed to her. The girl then goes to the Bach where she is meeting the boyfriend (he is on a plane running late as he just got a job with the vice president or something). She hears a knock on the door and itâs the guy from the friend group wanting to confess his love to her. She freaks out and he kills her (this happens in the kitchen). As the journalist is uncovering all of this through the autopsy, the police are hunting her and she is hiding out in the cafe upstairs. (Think the cafe was a family business passed down?) The family had paid money to keep the nature of the murder a secret. The guy who killed her was eventually killed in the back of the Bach I think? My friend who recommended it to me died a couple of weeks ago so Iâm stumped for the books name or author.

I do not remember the author's name. I am 90% sure of the title but there is a chance it was actually """"The Silver Fox"""" or """"The Gray Fox"""" I read this book in the 5th grade so 2005-2006. The cover had the face/head of a black fox and a teal green border. It was a chapter book of maybe 150 pages. The plot revolved around a kid (I can't remember if it was a boy or girl) who was sent to stay with relatives on a farm (I think an aunt and uncle but could have been grandparents). The kid sees a fox around the farm and becomes very interested in it. The adults catch a baby fox and use it as bait to trap an adult fox. I think the kid tried to release the baby fox but I don't entirely remember. I don't remember how the book ended. I specifically remember the kid carving notches in their suitcase to count the days and walking around outside trying to find a new color and being disappointed when they realized it was impossible to find a color that didn't already exist.

goodreads	23130989	1	NightingGale	2025-05-16T00:00:00Z	Well main thing is that it is a male x male romance. that is why the âCeoâ father and brother are homophobic. Man1 is not necessarily mentioned as a CEO but as someone who inherited the business, what the business does is that they take the assets and money of wealthy people and they keep it for safe keeping, i think its called a trust fund. The brother, before his death used to take the assets and money, and keep/ use it for himself, that is one of the reasons as to why the business was in shambles when Man1 inherited it, Man1 is dead set on reviving the business as a way to prove something to his homophobic father and brother, Man1s mother is the only one who supported him but never defended him. Man2 has his own problems, he has been running away from his hometown to escape his ex, his ex is a married man with a child, his ex keeps chasing him. Back when they were dating, it was a secret because the Ex didnât want to ruin his reputation, Ex only used Man2 for sexual favours. Man2 Runs away to another city, i am not sure but it may be New York, he works as a waiter in a cafe? (Not sure). Man2 meets Man1 and accidentally drops dirty dishes on him ( i am not sure if he drops dirty dishes or something else). The mother of Man1 hires Man2 because she thinks her son needs help for the business, Man2 is desperate as he got fired from the waiter job because of Man1, Man2 accepts the job. To prove Man2 is worthy to Man1, for the job, he retrieves all Man1s lost files and documents, which was important for the business, he has to retrieve it because the previous assistant quit and messed it all up before leaving. Man2 gets the job. In the beginning of the Job Man2 is focused on organising the database( not sure about the database part) Later on, after both of them start dating, Man2 goes to lectures to enhance his skills and be beneficial to the business, he meets a friend. SPOILER: One day meets he attends a lecture and his ex is at the lecture, the ex is the guest for the lecture, because he is the Mayor of Man2s hometown and the ex did something good (which was actually Man2s idea and plan, so basically the ex stole it and got successful) Man2 tries to run after lecture finishes but The Ex catches up and kisses him by force, the friend of Man2 intervenes and helps Man2 escape. Another event i remember is that Man1s deceased brother, got a girl pregnant, the girl has to prove the baby is the brothers, they prove this by taking Man1s Dna. SPOILER: The baby is the deceased brothers. thats is all the details i remember. Please find the book, i remember it is a Male X Male romance. Unfortunately i found this book through a wattpad adaptation, which got deleted, that is why i do not know the names nor their descriptions. I am sure it is a real book because the account that posted the adapted book, posted lots of other adapted books as well. And i vaguely remember it being mentioned that it is an âNon-profit Adaptationâ. Thank you so much if you are able to identify it or even if you have read till here! Thank you for your time!

She lives with her aunt and cousin because her mother passed away after being hit by a truck carrying oranges and the girl blames herself bcs she had a vision of her mother dying. Her best friend from school runs away and the protagonist realises that her best friend was kidnapped by some people who were taking in teenagers to play family with (in an abusive way), so the protagonist gets herself kidnapped in order to rescue her best friend. i read this in middle/high school, and one thing that stuck out to me was that the best friend tells the protagonist that she's planning to run away because she knew that protagonist was too busy drowning in her own misery to care. thanks in advance !

It could have been originally in English or Dutch, or a translated work. Hereâs what I remember: â¢ The protagonist is a young woman who wields a weapon (possibly a sword or bow and arrow) and travels through a fantasy world that includes dwarves and probably elves/fairies and wizards. â¢ Sheâs accompanied by a group, including a love interest with black hair. â¢ Eventually, the love interest betrays her, and they are forced to battle each other at the end because it turn out he was working for the main antagonist. I believe they somehow find a loophole and donât have to kill each other. â¢ The bookâs cover was made to look like in was bound in purple leather with gold book corners and it had a picture of the protagonist standing on rolling hills with her companions. This might have been a dutch edition though. I read it when I was around 10, but it could be intended for a slightly older audience. If anyone recognizes this book or has any suggestions, Iâd really appreciate it! Thanks in advance!	unusable

The fmc recieves a letter telling her she's about to meet her mate. She goes to the garden center to get some yard supplies and they are delivered by the mmc. The fmc thinks the mmc hates her. The fact that he's a reveant is important because (I think) she can't touch people (or maybe people are afraid to touch her). The subplot involves a gateway that the fmc finds out is in her back yard and at the end of the book, finds out she's going to protect it. It was definately a first in series.

goodreads	23131823	1	Theodore Lucas	2025-05-17T00:00:00Z	I'm looking for a book I read some years ago. It was published in the late 90s or early 2000s (I think). The book is about an upper class Boston family, the term Boston Brahman is used a bit, but the family in the story is not an actual historical family. I feel like the name Barrington is used, but I could be wrong. The book opens in Boston, and I think returns at times to Boston, but mainly plays out in France and Vietnam. In the opening of the book, the main character is college age and living with her grandfather who is fairly reclusive and frugal. The generation before the main character focuses on a woman, but I don't think it's the character's mother. The woman falls in love with a race car driver who is very successful, but he is also secretly a cat burglar. She knows this, though it's not confirmed until he steals from her. There is something about the fall of Saigon and evacuation of the babies and, I think the character's father. He is blamed for something that happens during that time, it might have been the character's mother's death, and even though he knows the truth and it would clear his name in the family, he chooses to take what he thinks is the more honorable path by taking some kind of blame. If I remember, he is there working for the State Department during the war. In the end of the story, all of the things come to light and all is forgiven. Throughout all of this, there is a collection of precious stones, at least a star sapphire and ruby, either star ruby or Burmese ruby. There may be other jewels in the collection, but I don't remember. The stones are spherical and fabled. The name of this collection of jewels is the title of the book. These jewels travel from Vietnam to France and then the main character finds herself in possession of them, I think. I don't think the stones ever went to Boston, but I could very well be wrong. I've attempted several library searches and two Chat GPT searches and have not found the book. I don't think the book was part of a series. I also think the cover was dark green, and maybe had a landscape of some kind on it. I don't think this book was a best seller, and I think the author is a woman, but I'm not sure.

They had been a gift from Francis Joseph, emperor of Austria, king of Hungary, to his beautiful, haunted wife, Empress Elizabeth. [...] Four were named for the planets with a variety of corundum as their stone: the yellow sapphire was called the Star of Venus, the orange-yellow sapphire the Mercury Stone, the beautiful pigeonâs blood ruby star-stone the Red Moon of Mars, and the velvety cornflower Kashmir sapphire the Star of Jupiter. Individually the ruby and the cornflower-blue sapphireâeach flawless, each cut into a perfect six-sided starâwere the most valuable. But as a whole, the unique collection was worth a fortune.The notion of the handsome, sexy Grand Prix driver amusing himself (he couldnât need the money) by stealing jewels went a long, long way toward renewing the romance of Le Chat.Years ago Sofi had arrived at Boston University as the sheltered uppermiddle-class girl from the suburbs, while Rebecca had been the outcast Boston Brahmin come home after ten years of exile in Florida with her motherâMai?â His voice cracked, and he tried to sound less threatening, less scary than he looked.

I was recently talking to a friend and we were laughing at the naughty books we read when we were in junior high/high school in the 80s/90s (e.g. Lace and Flowers in the Attic books). I mentioned a book called Rome and she didn't know that one and I tried to look it up and couldn't find it. Now I'm obsessed with finding it because I can't find it anywhere. I don't remember the author, but I swear it was just called Rome (maybe it had Rome in the title, but I just remember Rome) and the hardback copy I got from the library was a maroon color, with yellow/gold letters (it looked really sleek) and there was a silhouette drawing of the coliseum, or maybe the tower of pisa? Anyway, it was about a woman who traveled to Rome and there were some """"adventures."""" I don't remember anything about the book really except that cover is burned into my memory. And I was very careful not to leave it lying around because I didn't want anyone to pick it up and start reading it - lol! What is it with the Gen X girls reading books like this at that age?!? I read it in the late 80s or early 90s, so it couldn't have been published later than 1993. Anyone know this book? I feel like I'm going crazy because I can't find it anywhere! Thanks!"

goodreads	23132680	1	Nevaeh Brown	2025-06-05T00:00:00Z	So i read this book about ten years ago, maybe even before, and i believe it was older than that. It was either YA or middle grade, it was just a plain blue hardback but its possible it had a dust cover. The story was about a boy and a girl, possibly friends? Possibly siblings. They were somehow able to travel in other books and be a part of the story and im pretty sure their involvement actually changed the story on page so they would have to go back and fix it. I believe they went into books like little women and alice in wonderland, and a magazine about a volcano? I believe the girl was traveling into books first.

It was published under Scholastic and I remember seeing it at my school's Scholastic Book Fair that same time. I don't remember the any words in the name or the author. It was published in English and in the US by Scholastic. I've tried to search Scholastic's website to see if it's still listed but I couldn't find it unless I'm not looking in the right place. I've also tried to search on my old school's library card catalog but it's not there either. As for the plot, I remember there being a group of maybe 3 or 4 siblings--two girls and a boy I want to say. They get teleported away from each other and they have to find their way back. I don't remember how they found this teleportation device but I want to say it was like a doorway type of device. I remember one scene specifically where the youngest sister was teleported to a room that was filled with tree canopies and she had a caretaker with her. The caretaker encouraged the sister to keep climbing the trees to find a safer sleeping spot among the trees. As for the characters, I for sure remember the youngest sibling was a young girl about 6-8 years old. There was also a middle brother and an older sister. The cover, however, I remember distinctly. It was a swirl of blues and greens and in the middle was a doorway tilted a little bit. A little extra information: The book had short chapters, 2-5 pages and the chapters switched between the perspectives of the siblings. That's everything I remember about this book but if there's any questions, I'll try to answer them as best as I can!!

I read it in the early 2000s - probably between 2002 and 2005. Iâm not sure when it was published, but I donât think it was too long before I read it (e.g. not from the 80s). It was also one of those mass market/pulp fiction type pressings that were super popular in the early 2000s. Felt very in line with like Lurlene McDaniel type books (and wouldâve been in the same section at a store) with the drama and romance, except it wasnât sad and none of the main characters die or get sick. Itâs a stand alone novel. The cover had a hot pink outline/border, and I think a picture (or realistic drawing) of the blonde main character and a school bus. The book was about a teenage girl (who had long blonde hair) who had to leave her normal life behind and move in with her dad in Florida(?), I think because her mom died but not sure. I think her dad was an artist of some sort but also had a connection or something to scuba diving. I remember the dadâs house had a distinct mailbox or statue on the front porch, a manatee or mermaid? The girl ends up in a love triangle of sorts with some guy at her school (who is an epic douche) and some recently out of school guy thatâs connected to her dad. He may have worked with the dad or did odd jobs for him? His name may have been Seth or Sam? The girl ends up with him in the end. I think he teaches her to scuba dive? I think thereâs also a scene in the book where the girl is on a date with the high school boy and they see the older guy there? High school boy may also have blonde hair while I remember the older guy having dark hair. If anyone can pinpoint this book, I will be eternally grateful!!

Book was probably older than that anywhere from 1995 and forward??? anything helps, single book, i think the cover was pink.

Reading level would be 3-6. The book was about a girl who kept tally marks counting the number of words she said everyday, and it was basically about her social anxiety. That is all I remember plot wise. I think the cover might've been blue, but that could also be entirely made up. Thanks!

goodreads	23135519	1	Elizabeth âSmart Girls Love Trashy Booksâ	2025-06-05T00:00:00Z	Hey, long time no see! This book has been on my mind lately and I need to read it. But I can't remember the title! I saw this on a list of newly-acquired/soon to be published books. This was late 2010's, around 2017-2019. It was YA with a female author and was likely American given the subject matter. There wasn't much available for it, just the synopsis. The author said she wrote it as a response to climate change and how global warming is making storms worse and more frequent. The actual book was fictional and for YA. It was about a girl with storm trauma from Hurricane Harvey hitting her home who ends up going to a support group for storm anxiety. There she meets a boy who is mentally shattered from a devastating tornado outbreak in the Midwest. I don't remember which outbreak this was, it could've been made-up by the author or I just don't remember the specific one used. Unfortunately that's all I remember because like I said, this wasn't even published yet when I first saw it. Did it ever even get published? Is it completely different if it did? I guess I'll find out!

I have scattered memories of scenes from the book..?! Karl develops into a strapping muscular young man and I think has a romantic encounter with his fatherâs secretary.. I think the first part is Conrad hustling and becoming a millionaire in the shipping business? He has business in Japan and I think he leaves Karl behind to prove himself and work his way up in the company? Karl also learns martial arts in the meantime and becomes muscular and gains some confidence.. I remember a certain scene where Karl has a romantic encounter with his fatherâs busty secretary (whom his father also had an affairâ¦). Also at the climax Karl and his father have a knock down/drag out fight where I think Conrad tries to stab Karl?? I think Conradâs business headquarters is in New York.. This book possibly came out after the Shogun series became popular?? Thanks very much everyone in advance!! P.S. The cover may have had a Japanese theme?

goodreads	23136206	1	Nat	2025-06-05T00:00:00Z	The one book I have been looking everywhere and searching everywhere for is an Australian book about two brothers that go to an all-boys school and play football (I'm pretty sure) and they get into trouble a lot from pranks 1. I have no idea what you would call the genre (could be YA?). I never finished the book because I had just picked it up in the library while passing through but read like 5-6 chapters and had gotten that much from the plot, two brothers (this might not help but they might not be brothers but just good friends that I thought they could be brothers) who I think are Muslim, Arabic or Indian go to a school in Australia and attend an all-boys school, they get into trouble frequently, I'm pretty sure they play football or rugby for the school's team but a rival school ends up framing them for a prank at their school leaving some benched, not sure if they get benched or just detention. 2. I'm pretty sure I read this long ago, like before or after covid so like 2019-2020-2021. Bonus- A detail I remember about the book is the cover was like a bright orange/ that weird blush coral pink-salmon. It had the title and author in teal or white, which I don't remember otherwise I would be lookingð but it included silhouette/non detailed alike illustrations of four or so characters and the guernsey they were wearing for their team were teal and white.

I'm kicking myself for not taking a picture of it when I saw it at a used book shop. The title is Faery (something). Faeriest or Faery? it was specifically spelt with the F-a-e. Font was typical fantasy style script. I'm guessing by the style of the cover that it's an older book, late 2000's - mid 2010s maybe. The cover is yellow green, with the picture of a real woman, not an illustration. She has blond hair. Fair skin, and you can see the outline of faery wings behind her. Only her chest up is shown. She was wearing a sleeveless top, im pretty sure its white. She appears to be a young adult. The background is yellow light, radiating around her, which darkens to the more yellow-green hues. Its a series, with other books having a pink-salmon color scheme and a baby blue color scheme. Thanks for taking the time to read this!

Human government forced the surviving aliens to live in the reservation. The conditions in the reservation were very poor. The heroine was employed as one of the staff memebers, who were taking care of the aliens. The aliens did not look as your typical aliens in sci-fi romance (usually look very similar to humans). They reproduced by laying eggs. The heroine established a closer contact with one of the male aliens. He was trying to hatch one egg of his own. It was slow-burn romance. I read the book in English.

I had always thought this was a scene from âThe Breadwinnerâ series, but recently I came to realize that this never happened in those books. This scene stuck in my mind because I was traumatized by it as a young kid reading it. This is what I can recall: A girl and her mom live in a country in the middle east and the Taliban have a lot of power and are very feared. The girl and her mom are working to start a school. The mom gets invited to this meeting with some authoritative people about the school, but it turns out to be a trap. The mom is murdered (it never said how, just that she was killed) and dumped on the doorstep of her home. Her daughter opens the door to find her dead mother lying there, with a threatening note pinned to her shirt. The daughter must flee her home and go in a journey to a safe place.

It's about a teen girl. Loner, brunette, self conscious about her big breasts. *Spoilers* There's a scene, where she's at a table with busty old ladies and wonders how they don't feel their breasts being crushed by the table. She puts her own above the table. She meets a girl, her age, taller, short haired blonde, maybe in a bathroom. Girl's more experienced. I think I remember the girl sharing her red lipstick. She envies girls flat chest. Girl envies her fuller one. They lie about their ages, to get into a club, and I think it's there, she meets an older man. I believe he's blonde, with the name Dylan Thomas, or Thomas Dylan. She compares his name to a poet. They get involved. He takes her to meet his Asian ex wife at an event, showing of her art, of some kind. He takes her virginity, and compares her skin to eggshells. He later introduces her to an older man, I remember to be dark haired, and heavy. He convinces her to go a date with a male friend. He buys her lobster, I think. Don't know if she slept with him, but she later tells her guy, that she doesn't like him, and he replies that the guy was really hoping she liked him. In the end, she finds him in bed with her new friend, and they act like it's no big deal. He pulls her to the side, and tells her, he wants them to have a threesome, which the friend seems fine with, but says he realizes she's not ready for that. She leaves him, and I think that's how the book ends.

goodreads	23139069	1	CorkyNSam92	2025-05-27T00:00:00Z	Unfortunately, I do not remember much about the story line. I believe the FMC is named Blue Beads. The MMC may have a rivalry with another character. I believe the MMC/FMC have a son. And at some point she has a daughter, but does not know if the child is her husband's or the other character who assaults her. I think there may be a part where there is another couple set in future and it's implied that it's actually the main couple in future; not sure about this part. I have tried googling every author I could think of and searched for romance books with a character named Blue Beads, but no luck. I think the FMC may have been wearing a yellow dress or Native American garment on cover. I believe that when looking at the cover the FMC is on the left side and the MMC is on the right side. There may have been some blue or water on the cover. I would like to find the book so I could finish reading it.

He is semi-wild and the pack needs him to come back because war is coming to them and he is a very strong alpha. The heroine is a pack member who cannot shift although I think she is in her mid-late twenties, so they send her because she is a bit expendable. Importantly, she is sleeping with the alpha's best friend, who doesn't want to mate her because of the fact that she cannot shift. She goes to the mountain, he doesn't kill her but starts ignoring her, and she cannot leave in good conscience. She stays to take care of him since he is living in filth and is very emanciated I think. He gives her an ultimatum that he thinks is impossible: He will only leave the cabin as her mate,and only if she shifts. She agrees, but fails to shift until they are attacked by assasins trying to kill him and she manages to fight as a wolf in the fight. They leave the cabin as mates and return to the pack. Her old lover now confesses his love and tries to mate her since she now managed to shift, but she is loyal to he new unlikely mate and refuses. The rest of the book is them getting closer and preparing for war. - I heard an audiobook of this book on youtube between 2022-2024. Can someone help me????

goodreads	23139784	1	Anya	2025-06-05T00:00:00Z	okay so unfortunately I don't remember that much about this book. I read it sometime between 2017-2019. basically, these kids were going on a field trip. 2 siblings and a bunch of their friends/classmates. I remember the siblings were a boy and a girl of around the same age. their parents were chaperones. they were supposed to meet at a statue of a bull (may have involved a human statue standing with/riding the bull), and were there at one point in the story. one character had a camera and took a bunch of photos. things went wrong pretty fast, the group got separated. i seem to remember someone (possibly the adults), having some kind of bet? the parents were of the 2 siblings I am pretty sure. one of the characters may have been called Kyle. at one point there was a video game session? i feel like they also had to wear some kind of matching clothes (not uniform), and there may have been a rat mascot involved. the field trip was to new york. that's all I remember. it was a very chaotic book.

goodreads	23141288	1	Kit	2025-06-05T00:00:00Z	I wish I could remember more about this book but I'll try my best. I would've read it around 2005-2008. The protagonist was a boy, and he was part of a group of secret time travellers. I'm pretty sure they travelled through portals to specific time periods I think in order to either fix events that had gone wrong in the past, or to ensure that they went as expected. There was a rival faction who were also time travelling to the past to mess up the events, make them go wrong, or put people into power that they wanted there, and it was a back and forth between the heroes and the villains to make history go the way they wanted. For some reason I want to say the 'good' faction wore green clothing and the 'bad' one wore purple but that could be totally wrong.	unusable			series

goodreads	23141538	1	Mandy Smith	2025-05-30T00:00:00Z	90s Fiction set during Russia revolution/New York and Hollywood The daughter of English professor had been living in Russia with her father when the Revolution started, She was secretly and chastely in love with the married Prince Xavier (I think) who gifts her a diamond brooch from Cartier or Faberge. She manages to escape Russia with Grand Duchess/Princess Sophie Sophia and her granddaughter Tatiana Tania. They are challenged on the train by a Russian General but manage to escape. Tatianaâs brother is captured by the same General and despite being ordered to kill him he raises him. He has a natural son Boris who intensively dislikes the interloper and tries to kill him by a wire between two trees whilst he is out riding. The women end up in a tenement building in New York and she befriends a Jewish pawnbroker. The women of the neighbourhood all pawn their husbandâs best shirt for 10 cents and redeem them back weekly for church/synagog. She swears the child to secrecy about their escape from Russia saying it is all a game. When the princess dies the main character is forced to try and pawn a diamond she has smuggled out of Russia to pay for the funeral. The pawnbroker is suspicious and accuses her of theft. During the funeral the child cries out in RussianâI donât like this game / I donât want to pay this game any more, I want Princess Sophie backâ and the pawnbroker who can speak Russian realises where they are from and the history of the diamond. She also makes friends with neighbour woman who is Polish and has a lot of children by her husband â possibly Jacob â and she cooks him tripe and onions weekly. At some point she is forced to pawn the diamond brooch and the buyer immediately contacts someone who had registered interest whenever any Russian jewelrey was sold. The man who buys the brooch tracks her down and courts and marries her but eventually she realises he is not who he seems and after finding and taking back the brooch she flees. I believe he is after deeds to Russian mines. After fleeing they head back to NY but neighbour has moved to LA with her family after being abandoned by her Polish husband. She finds a new woman at the house who says âJacob can have many more Polish children with meâ. Pawnbroker who is secretly in love with her also heads to LA and eventually becomes a rich successful Hollywood studio-head. The son of the Polish neighbour wants to work in studio and goes for the day â he is given a tour by the owner but does not realise until one of the staff says âHe gave you a private tour of the studio todayâ Tania becomes famous Hollywood star but is mentally fragile. I think she marries the pawnbroker turned studio head in the end and there is more about the brother/Boris who becomes head of the KGB.

goodreads	23141941	1	Rebeka	2025-05-30T00:00:00Z	I'm looking for a book I read a year or two ago. It's part of a series that follows a group of high school friends. This particular book focuses on a quiet, reserved girl who, after losing her mother, takes care of her younger brothers while her father grieves. Her father is an architect. She gets good grades and loves reading. The male protagonist is a student at the same high school, though they donât really know each other at first. Their paths cross when he becomes her younger brotherâs baseball coach. As they start talking, he realizes that her family situation is difficult, and he begins helping her after schoolâcooking dinner and looking after her brothers. Since her motherâs passing, she has struggled with bulimia, which he eventually discovers. Wanting to support her, he does his best to help her through it. She has a great sense of humor when she drinks, which adds a unique aspect to her character. Midway through the book, her father starts to recover emotionally, thanks in part to the boy, who confides in his own mother about the situation. She then steps in to help the girl and her brothers. Her father regains control of his life and, as a gesture of support, writes her a recommendation letter for a scholarship with an internship at an architecture firm. The girl and boy face challenges when they have to maintain a long-distance relationship. There are ups and downs, including a miscarriage and infidelity on his part. However, in the end, everything works out, and they get married. Iâm not sure if this helps, but the first book in the series tells the story of a girl who, before her prom, goes to a restaurant for dinner. There, she discovers her boyfriend cheating on her with her best friend. Heartbroken, she leaves with a group from a rival school (the same group of friends from the series) and has an unexpectedly fun night. However, later, she receives a phone callâthere has been a home invasion gone wrong, and her entire family has been killed. In the aftermath, she stays with the boy she just met and his parents, who help her cope with her loss over time.

The period is during the depression, the girl's family moves to a new location, the whole family works for a peach canner. I remember that school children make fun of the girl for wearing 5 and dime clothing. The girl finds an entrance into what appears to be an abandoned building (I think?) and finds a room full of books and so she often disappears and hides in the room to read. I also remember the son of the cannery owners is a bully who picks on the girl but the girl's parents excuse his behavior because the depression also made his family poor.

I think the FMC's name is Rose; MMC calls her Tiger. One of the older lady's sons is named Ammon. At least I think it is. I think he is the one that made the car blow up. MMC is studying to be a teacher. Female main character also is a paramedic. I remember a lot more, but cannot figure out how to do the search apparently.

And I remember scenes where the invisible guy looks in the living room to see if his parents are still looking for him, because theyâre like âwhere is heâ.

And his friend and him kinda like investigate how he turned invisible and they come to the conclusion that the invisible guy consumed something and like a side effect..? made him invisible. And iâm not sure BUT i THINK he goes back to being visible at the end. Please help me find this bookkk :)

It's about this controversy involving a manuscript that involves Jesus in some kind of salacious context, something erotic and controversial. I think the protagonist was some kind of editor or literary critic. The first part of the book deals with the whole controversy around the manuscript. Then the editor reads the manuscript and sees it's actually really good literature. That's as much as I recall. It's hard to find it on Google, as anything involving Jesus either gives me religious results or Da Vinci and """"book about book"""" doesn't help much. Thanks!"

I remember most of the stories being between opposite sex partners, but some same-sex stories. I think there were a dozen stories. The title may have been First Time or something to do with cherries? I remember cherries on the dark blue or black book cover. One was of a girl who didn't want to have sex before marriage, and it hadn't come up between her and her boyfriend yet. They were passionately kissing and she shifted position on the couch, accidentally crushing a bag of chips with her back. """"Very few people think about chips in the heat of passion. But tortilla chips have very pointy edges."""" The girl's name was possibly Beth? She told her boyfriend she wanted to wait and he was a little surprised, but fine. They went out for Italian food. The server asked if they wanted extra virgin olive oil and they both laughed. """"I can bring you butter instead,"""" she suggested. """"No,"""" said the boyfriend, taking Beth's hand and smiling. """"This is right."""" I think the story was called Extra Virgin. Another story in the anthology had a title with a math pun. The POV character was a huge math nerd. He would give himself pep talks while biking up the hill to school. """"Man, I'm feeling kind of obtuse,"""" he'd say during a bad day, and then, """"I'm feeling absolutely acute!"""" on a wonderful day. He had a huge crush on a boy in his class, who he was assigned to tutor. The boy's name was Matt. After they had sex, Matt ignored him and hissed at him when he tried to ask why Matt was ignoring him. Matt used homophobic slurs. The POV character realized Matt was struggling with his sexuality and he didn't want to have to comfort Matt, since he was already out and it had been a hard journey. I think one of the stories written about two women having sex involved Catholicism and guilt. I'll comment if I remember anything else."

It was a teen girl book I would say and was from a publisher that published lots of teen girl books as I'd read others that were from the same publishers. The story was about a girl who had been brought up by relatives (I think Aunt?) because her mum had killed her dad (domestic violence I think?). She saved money from babysitting and when she came of age, she moved back to her family house which was dilapidated. There was still a blood stain where the death had happened. She cleaned up the house and lived off the land, growing vegetables and I think hunting meat. There was a local store that she visited. Any ideas what the book could have been?!

Very 2000s/2010s YA feel to the book. One of the main characters I believe is Indian and she has a white stepmom that she doesn't really like. The stepmom wears a sari in one scene (I think just for a parent meet & greet or something at the boarding school). In one scene, one of the main characters is with a boy who's smoking and she takes the cigarette when he offers it to her, even though she doesn't know how to smoke. She puts the wrong end in her mouth. I would have read it probably between 2010 and 2016.

The first book is told from someone who lives in the mountains (a young boy) and then one of the later books is more focused on a young female character who eventually becomes queen I think but she was raised in the wild and has no social skills.

It was about a female reporter, I think for a TV station but could have been a newspaper. I can only remember some disconnected scenes: her friend has the surname Thibodeaux but the network thinks that's too complicated and want to spell it phonetically. She interviews someone who has been in an 'Alive' type situation and upsets the network by asking him what human flesh tastes like. She (and one of her friends?) have edited their pre-recorded obits to make themselves sound amazing. There was some reference to Zubrowka bisongrass vodka. I remember the books as having a vibe a bit like Janet Evanovich but smarter, and I think one of the covers had a picture of a woman in sunglasses but manipulated with bright colours - maybe a hot pink border and bright yellow or blue sunglasses frames?

Elizabeth? was dating Ethan, but really wanted to date another guy. She played them off and tried to make both boys/young men jealous. Ethan played football.

""""Wow, he's going in a straight line. He's still swimming in a straight line! Boy, this is exciting,"""" she described an imaginary swim meet dryly. Elizabeth laughed and defended her swimmer boyfriend. The book contained multiple POVs. One of them was the swimmer boyfriend's POV. He wanted to be with Elizabeth, but knew he was being involved in a love triangle and had no idea why. He thought and thought about it, even while swimming. He finished his daily laps, was still thinking about Elizabeth, and thought to himself, """"Well, it's nothing another fifty laps couldn't cure."""" He jumped back into the pool and a new chapter started. He was also struggling with his father remarrying. His dad had remarried a Native American woman, whose origins were brought up every sentence she was mentioned. The book, though, kept referring to her as American Indian, and mentioned a few times that she or her parents had been involved in the American Indian Movement. He also clearly thought she was hot. I remember being unsettled by this--she was his stepmother and clearly uninterested. She was nice to him though, and was trying to get to know him. I'm pretty sure Elizabeth wound up with the swimmer at the end. The book ended on a cliffhanger of some kind. I'll comment if I remember anything else."

Tried google, chatgpt but no success:( It might be kind of adult romance because of scenes. Series has 3 men (maybe friends) who own a forest wild camping tour place thing. I think there are 3 books in the series. Read the books a few months ago, I think they might have been released in the last 4-6 years, but don't want to guess as I really don't remember. Feels modern. 1st book: woman goes to the multi-day camping tour thing and meets one man who is the tour leader. There might be some action, as woman sees illegal hunting man or something. 2nd book: woman with baby boy goes to work at this tour place (starts in the office) and meet second man. There is a scene where the woman was invited to dinner by locals (maybe lead from 1st book), her kid is crying, someone rings the door, she opens the door with her kid, there is the male lead, who takes the baby from her and the baby stops crying. 3rd book: I think third male lead is leading a camping group, they are bachelor and bachelorette party from the same wedding, and male lead like a woman from the group.

goodreads	23152206	1	Mikaella Dallal	2025-06-12T00:00:00Z	I read this book around 2021-2023 but I am unsure when it was published. From the style of drawing on the cover I am assuming 2005-2015 ish. The cover is the girl with brown hair facing forward (the reader) and one half is normal world sweater and jeans while the other half is like a simple princess dress. Her hair might be braided on the princess side? The title is not one word but not a whole sentence either. I'm like 85% confident in that. The plot: Middle school/early high school aged girl who lives with mom and has really only one friend. She goes to therapy and is generally unhappy but I can't remember what happened. She's kinda a weirdo and loves fantasy things and whatnot. One day after school she's trying to talk to a boy and is all of a sudden magicked/poofed out of our world and into a magical world, like castles and rolling hills. She finds this old guy who I think is the last wizard and advisor to the king. She is technically the princess but was taken from their world so long ago that her family is gone/dead. The girl and the wizard go on travels around the country to find answers, specifically about why and how she keeps getting pulled back and forth at random intervals between worlds. When she comes back to the real world, basically no time has passed no matter how much time she spent in the magic world. When she comes back she is not taken seriously that this event happened and is called crazy and is forced to do more therapy. So she gets pulled back and the adventures continue (I think this is a duology or trilogy, maybe duology with an adjacent 3rd story about her son?) and eventually she and the old wizard find a cave that is the source of the magic that keeps pulling her back and forth at random. It's like a glowing magic sphere forcefield thing where some old sorcerers used to work hiding from the world? It ends with she is allowed to stay in the magic world long enough to grow old, marry the love interest, and have kids. When one day she feels it (the tingle) and she gets pulled back into the real world for the final time, still in her gown, and she goes to find her childhood friend who is also grown up and has her own daughter and they reconnect and it's a great ending. I really enjoyed this book and it is killing me that I don't remember anything useful.

goodreads	23153703	1	Rosa	2025-06-14T00:00:00Z	I saw this story on the Internet, actually, maybe 12-15 years ago. But its style was old-fashioned; it reminded me of A.A. Milne, E. Nesbit, or Rumer Godden. It had a bright, light tone, definitely meant for children. Important words were capitalized for emphasis, I think. It was a prose retelling of the well-known carol, in which King W. and his loyal page brave the snow to bring flesh, wine, and firewood to a poor peasant's cottage. Then they leave before the peasant gets home, and it describes how surprised and delighted he is when he finds what they left. I think the miracle of the heated footprints occurs too. It felt Edwardian, but it could have been later, from the '20s, or earlier (Victorian).	unusable			short story

At least one city was buried on the salt. I do not remember much else from the book aside from the fact that it had a blue cover, haha. I read this book as an older child/young teen, so probably between 1991 and 1997, so it was likely published in the late 80s or early 90s. Please help me interweb friends!

goodreads	23157029	1	Sadie Newkirk	2025-06-19T00:00:00Z	This book would have been published pre 2015 and I got it from the library in the young adult fantasy section. It had a dragon and some blue and green mist on the cover. There was also a girl who both the boys had a crush on who had cigarette burns from a family member. I also recall her and the visible boy kinda hook up in this like snow storm in order to keep warm. They are in the snow again and the boy says no and that theyâll just hold each other close because he knows the other boy has a crush on her. I think the invisible boy was going to like talk to a dragon or something they were trying to find a way to make him visible and when they do he looks identical to the other boy. I wish I had more details but this is all I can recall about this book and itâs been driving me crazy I canât remember the title.

Some of the scenes I remember are âa girl and possibly her brother are told in the middle of school that their parents died (car crash?) âsome old ladies claiming to be their great aunts or something like that either half kidnap them or manage to adopt them âkids are then basically kidnapped and took to an old house and they learn the old ladies are evil âthe kids are forced to work as maids? âthereâs a door hidden behind wallpaper (the girl notices it because the wallpaper is upside down or something like that) âboy gets taken to the room or something and is locked in a cage and the girl has to get in to free him âgirl steals one of the keys and makes a cast out of melted candy for it (main scene I remember) âI believe the candy played a major role outside of the key âI'm not entirely sure but I think the evil ladies were magical? like witches? Spent a long time trying to remember this book before coming here. I believe this is a book, but it is very possible it might have been a movie. I read it when I was a kid.

Sheâs loves school and staying organized. She is a teacherâs pet and loves to do her homework and keep things tidy. She is lonely and has no friends. â¢ Her bedroom is in the attic of her house and she imagines she is a princess in her âcastleâ up there. â¢ She brings soup in a thermos to school. â¢ A new girl joins her class â messy, loud, chaotic and carefree. I think she had long red hair and her name may have started with S. â¢ The girls clash, especially when they have to work on a school project together. â¢ Thereâs a scene where the messy girl comes to class soaking wet and makes a big mess in the classroom. She gets the neat girl wet even though she wore galoshes to stay dry. â¢ The messy girl brings a newt to school at some point and the neat girl is disgusted. â¢ The neat girl is not very popular at first, but as she loosens up, she becomes more accepted. â¢ The messy girl visits the neat girlâs attic âcastleâ and doesnât like the princess fantasy, or maybe the neat girl was embarrassed about it and tried to keep it a secret but it was revealed somehow. â¢ The two eventually become friends and neat girl learns to loosen up and have more fun. The cover likely showed both girls with their arms crossed â the neat one frowning or serious (short, darker hair), the messy one smiling and mischievous (red hair).

I thought the book said it was the island that is furthest from any mainland. She is secretly married to the island's doctor, but only so that he can remain on the island. The mmc gets dropped off on the island. I think he was on the island when he was younger with his dad. His dad had been in love with the fmc's mom. The fmc was on a boat with her mom when she was little and the mom died, possibly killed by the girl's dad. The fmc was found alone on the boat. For some reason, I feel like the mmc is somewhat famous in the US, maybe a baseball player? Fmc is a virgin. SPOILER: at some point near the end of the story, the fmc's husband/the doctor tries to SA her. I feel like that guy (the husband/doctor) is killed. The fmc ends up leaving the island with the mmc.

Iâm trying to find the title (or author) of a tween/early-teen novel I read around 2010, possibly purchased at a school book fair. Itâs part of a pair (or duology) of books featuring best friends, each book told from a different girlâs perspective. What I remember about the books: â¢ The first book (the prequel) is told from the best friendâs point of view. She gets a boyfriend in that story. â¢ The second book is from the main girlâs perspective. This one starts with a pizza falling on the floor, which she interprets as a sign because the pizza shape looks like a boy. â¢ The main girl makes a list of boys she could or wouldnât date. â¢ Throughout the second book, she frequently mentions âitâs a signâ moments. â¢ She even uses a cootie catcher (paper fortune teller) to help make decisions. â¢ Thereâs a bake sale rivalry in the cafeteria between the main girl and a popular girl. â¢ The chapters are written as dated journal entries, almost like diary pages. â¢ The covers of the two books are distinct: one is purple and the other is blue â both have a kind of journal or notebook style, and possibly a sticky-note-like square on the front cover. â¢ The books are middle-grade or tween fiction, focused on school, friendships, crushes, and social rivalry. If anyone recognizes this description or knows the titles/authors, I would be so grateful! Thank you so much!	unusable			duology

goodreads	23163031	1	M R	2025-06-28T00:00:00Z	"I read this book a couple years ago, but I think it had been out for a little while and was not new at the time of my reading. This books has two points of view, one from the hero (a homeless veteran who has been suffering flashbacks and ptsd episodes seemingly at random) and the other from the heroine (a woman who was widowed due to her husband driving during a winter storm or maybe just bad weather in general, she now has a phobia of driving in bad weather). The hero has been homeless and we are shown that he has been sleeping in a pool or tool shed of some kind, until he gets caught or maybe fears he will be caught, during the night then he goes scavenging during the day for food. He narrates what the best neighborhoods to dumpsters dive in are like and finds a house where someone lives who throws out lots of food (and food that hasn't even expired). This turns out to be the heroine's house. Winter is coming and things are getting more and more dire on the streets for our hero. Our heroine's perspective is one in which she struggles with loneliness in a big house that her husband wanted and he never let her decorate. Throughout the novel we learn that her husband wasn't someone who really loved her, but maybe liked the idea of a trophy wife. We also learn that the husband was more her mother's pick than her own, and the mother is a domineering, critical woman who has helped our heroine to develop an unhealthy relationship with food and with her own self image in general. The heroine works with children in some capacity and she loves books (I think she may work as a childrens librarian or in some other educational role, but I am sure she loves books!). Our heroine's perspective shows us her spotting the hero and eventually she gives him pizza and or other left overs. I think she maybe called him """"pizza dude"""" or something before knowing his name. Over a period of time she begins to worry more and more about the hero being outside in the winter and the heroine's nosy neighbor starts calling the cops on the homeless man. Eventually the cops are called and the heroine lies to the cops (who know her because her father is a big wig in the police force) and says the hero is an old friend of hers who is actually staying with her. This lie forces the hero to go inside the house and eventually the heroine invites the hero to stay in her garage to keep out of the weather. There are more conflicts with the neighbors (it turns out the neighbor-husband is cheating on the neighbor-wife) and the neigbor continues to cause issues for the hero. The hero does not like being in debt to the heroine so he offers to do work to pay for his lodging. He is very handy and begins fixing bathrooms and eventually does a massive renovation of a room that the heroine always wanted to display books and things in but her husband wouldn't allow it. During this time the hero is also looking for jobs outside the house and gets some odd jobs around the neighborhood helping an elderly neighbor. However, his ptsd is still an issue and as the novel unfolds it seems like flashing lights trigger flashbacks to his time at war. The heroine pushes for him to get some kind of therapy and they grow closer and closer. During this time, the heroine is growing in self confidence and the hero is supporting her dreams and reinforcing that she is smart and capable. Eventually they are dating and the heroine introduces the hero to her parents.

The points that match: An alien ship lands on Earth and consumes plant cellulose. It sends out mobile machines that harvest fieldsâinitially leaving behind hay bales. Eventually, those machines begin producing flying cars for humans. Toward the end, the aliens erect prefabricated houses âfor free,â and in the final scene, someone glimpses a human-like figure inside oneâimplying the aliens are mimicking humans or building new ones	solved	The Visitors	132718	by Clifford D.

goodreads	23164058	1	Roberta Karchner	2025-06-29T00:00:00Z	I read the book in the early 70s but may have been around longer. Bradbury, Arthur Clarke, or Heinlein, more fantasy than Asimov. Some form of alien ship lands, and had a mobile factory that went across hay field, leaving hay bales behind. After awhile, instead of hay bales, it made cars (possibly flying) and left them. People took the free cars. I donât remember if it made other products, but towards the end, it began producing free houses for everyone. It closes with the latest edition of the houses being produced, and they see motion behind the curtains, the implication is that they are either populating the earth with new humans, or are becoming human.

goodreads	23164651	1	Charlotte Bury	2025-06-30T00:00:00Z	I read this book from my school library perhaps in 2020 or around that time - the book wasnât older than 2000âs that I can remember. My memory of it is a little foggy but I believe it was set in India or around Southern Asia. The girl was raised in secret and would often be given letters or updates on the girls life who she was a spare for. They were identical and so any injury the original got she had to get too and so on. There were other copies for people around the world but I think they had become illegal so she was not to tell anyone about it. SPOILERS AHEAD. One day the original girl died and before anybody found out in the community the fmc was sent to their house to replace her. The parents acted as if nothing happened and treated her as their real daughter. There were some younger siblings (I think brothers) who were not aware but may have realised later on that she wasnât really their sister. She had to go to school and hang out with friends trying to fit in but they may have known something was off. She may have found out secrets about the original from her room. I know there was a love interest or male friend in the story but I donât remember if he was the original girls boyfriend or if he was another copy she met. They ran off somewhere and were being hunted by the organisation who creates the copies (I think though it may have been the police). They tried to sneak in somewhere to destroy something or find out information, and they went to hide out in some upstairs place and may have kissed lol but nothing more as a teen book. I donât remember how it ends but please help me find this haha.

(Note: it could be another Latin American country, I may not remember correctly) Her Dad sends her to visit her family there. She meets a boy her age, a goat herder who plays guitar. (I think his name was possibly Pedro?) They slowly begin to fall in love. They both want to discover an almost mythical waterfall hidden in the forest around the mountain village somewhere. While this is happening, her grandmotherâs story is also unfolding. Something happens to the boy, but he survives. They find the waterfall together. Then she goes home to the US. Anyone have any idea what this might be? Thanks so much for reading this! I know itâs a bit long.

goodreads	23164900	1	Iamdebster	2025-06-30T00:00:00Z	This is part of a series. The male lead is still pining after his dead wife but regularly sleeps with the female lead. He is pretty mean to her. She is desperately in love with him and takes his cruelty. She has a miscarriage after he verbally railed on her when she revealed the pregnancy. I recall him telling her that she could never mean as much to him as his dead wife did. He even called her by his wife's name in bed. Yep, he was a complete A-hole to her. I remember a particular scene when he showed up at her place and took her sledding. She had become reclusive and depressed after the miscarriage. He was beginning to redeem himself and wanted to help her. It was the first time since she lost the baby that she enjoyed herself. The dead wife's name was Anna/Anne. She died horrifically during, or as a result of, an abduction that occurred in an earlier book. I think there was also some level of SA involved. The female lead was a school counselor. She was helping out a kid who lived with an abusive father. She confronted the guy, and he punched or slapped her. The male lead was NOT PLEASED! Finally, the female almost died from blood poisoning that was a result of the miscarriage. She flatlined and saw Anna. Thanks for Any Help!				TW: SA; abuse

goodreads	23164900	8	Iamdebster	2025-07-11T00:00:00Z	Other tidbits that I remember...kind of random but maybe they will trigger someone's memory: One of the FMC from an earlier book in the series is Mia. She is married to a deputy sheriff or actual sheriff and they were the main characters in an earlier book. I believe Mia was kidnapped with Anna (see original post) during her book and this is when Anna was killed. A main setting of the book is a bar which is owned by one of the MMC and I think the FMC works there. She lives in a second-floor apartment connected to the bar. She has her miscarriage at her front door after the MMC berates her then leaves. She is found by her brother...I think he is a MMC in another book in the series. I believe, but don't hold me to it, that the FMC's name starts with a C...perhaps Catherine or Christine.				
goodreads	23164900	9	Iamdebster	2025-07-11T00:00:00Z	A Clarification: The FMC almost died from Sepsis that occurred as a result of her miscarriage. It occurred later in the story after the MMC groveled for his horrible behavior upon learning she was pregnant, and the FMC took him back. The sepsis symptoms started in the morning and were mistaken for a cold or flu. The MMC was angry with the FMC for putting herself in danger by confronting the abusive father of the student she was trying to protect by herself. Everyone warned her not to, but she did not listen and ended up with a bruise on her face. (see original post.) After berating the FMC and storming from their place, the FMC's health deteriorates. The MMC eventually returns intending to apologize for his over-the-top behavior to find her unresponsive. Paramedics are called and she is rushed to the hospital and remains in a coma with little hope. During this time, the MMC's dead wife/GF (see original post) visits her and urges her to stay with the MMC and gives her blessing.

It was an unexciting adventure except for, I think, an encounter with a snake at one point.

It includes interesting facts about the history behind various geological locations in Greece and Rome and their mythological origins and the history behind their names. It also gives useful facts about the rituals of worship of the various gods too.

GENRE: Mystery Thriller PLOT DETAILS: - a girl (possibly blonde) is popular and she makes headlines news when she is dead. - the death happens/shown in the first chapter(s)/prologue - i think she was killed by burning/severing of limbs/axe was the weapon i think/or she was knocked out cold (?) inside the cabin in the snowy mountain - i think she was in a party or i dont know --skip to what i can remember vividly - a group of friends (possibly mc girl, two boys with her) decided to go on a trip bringing a car with them to the destination - car breaks down/stuck in a blizzard/snow storm on the side of a mountain - they walked on foot and found a cabin in the snowy mountain/resort - everything seemed normal until they discover(?) something or something happened and mysterious person chases after them. the killer of the girl in the prologue. - they get separated at one point. idk if one of them dies. i remember a chase happening between one of the male guy (i think love interest of mc and one of the boys) in a slope where he had to go to a gas station/truck/convenience store to hide from the killer? â¢ other notable details: - the guy who was chased and probably one of the friends might've been named mike, marc, or mark. any of that variant. he might be a jock. - the main character girl is somehow related to the first girl who died and it was revealed in the book. the death of the girl wws of great impact to them in the revelation of the killer. maybe it was a sister or a friend or a senior from school she hated. - mc survives btw - i think they use the term """"sheriff"""" in this story to address the police If this book is not found, it means it is a really old book and I give up after years of searching since I just read it from my friend who thrifted it on a booksale ð¤£"

The blue sun has a power to improve peoples brain. But if you stayed too much. You would die from brain bleeding. Also as I remember there was a dog stayed a bit too much in the sun and achieved telepath powers so main charachter could talk with dog via to telepathy In another book (maybe the second or third), the main character had to jump into a hole that would take around three months to fall through. To survive, they cast a spell that shrank their food, and she had to remember to eat according to its real size. At the bottom of the hole, there was a butterfly with portals on its wings.

goodreads	23172114	1	Carla Kruse	2025-07-09T00:00:00Z	Hi everyone, Iâm trying to track down a young adult novel I read sometime in the 1990s. It was intense, emotional, and has stayed with me all these years, but I canât remember the title. Hereâs what I recall: â¢ The main character is a young, blonde, extremely thin girl who suffers from anorexia. â¢ She has psychic and supernatural abilitiesâshe can see spirits, occasionally see the future, and has the ability to levitate. â¢ Thereâs a scene where she possibly dies or has a near-death experience herself, and brings herself back to life. â¢ A man in his mid-20s (possibly around 26) finds out about this. Heâs somewhat charming but untrustworthy, and the girl seems to be developing feelings for him. â¢ He persuades her to be part of a dangerous stunt or actâhe would be submerged in a tank of water, he would die and she would resuscitate him afterward. â¢ The girl is very hesitant and feels itâs wrong, but he convinces her to go through with it. He promises her something in return (I donât remember what), and she agreesâbut only after he makes her swear to bring him back. â¢ During the act, she sees his soul leave his body and begin ascending into the afterlife. He looks peaceful, free, and truly happy. â¢ She makes the heartbreaking decision not to revive him, feeling it would be wrong to pull him back from that peace. â¢ The story explores themes of life, death, eating disorders, spiritual gifts, manipulation, and emotional struggle. â¢ I also vaguely remember the cover being shades of dark and light blue, possibly showing the girl floating or levitating. It had a haunting, otherworldly, yet deeply emotional tone. If anyone out there remembers this book, Iâd be so grateful to know the title!

goodreads	23172461	1	Georgia Oliver	2025-07-10T00:00:00Z	I read this book about 7ish years ago but I want to say it was published in the 2000s or early 2010s. It opens with the male main character whoâs in his late teens waking up at some kind of train or bus station with no memory, he doesnât have a bag but he finds a book in his back pocket. The book is temporarily taken from him but he gets it back with the help of security. Since he doesnât remember anything about himself he takes on the name of the author of the book. Iâm pretty sure at one point he finds a historical site that used to be the authors property and starts secretly staying in the cabin on the land but I could be wrong about who it belonged to. But he starts interacting with a few teens in the area and makes friends. Towards the end of the book he regains his memory and remembers why he ran away. One night he and his friends were driving around in his car - or a family car - and crashed into a snow pile Iâm pretty sure, he thought the car was fine since it drove back to the house fine. The next day he had to drive his sister to her dance lesson but the brakes didnât work and they ended up crashing and she lost one of her legs. He felt an overwhelming amount of guilt and blamed himself for her losing her leg so he ran away with a duffel bag of his stuff. A group of people at one point mugged him for the duffel bag and thatâs how he lost his memory. From what I can remember the book ends with him contacting his father and letting him know where he is and they meet at one of the ends of the Appalachian trail. The title of the book has something to do with the authors name that he used when he didnât remember his own.

goodreads	23172854	1	Cari-Anne	2025-07-10T00:00:00Z	I read this book before 2013, so itâs likely older or out of print. I believe it was adult historical fiction/romance, written in first person, trade paperback size. The story is set in Europe just before WWII. The main character is a young Jewish woman living with her mother, father, and an âadoptedâ sister â possibly named Lore, Lorelei, or something similar. I donât recall if the sister was also Jewish, but she had bad teeth (possibly due to post-WWI malnutrition) and had earned a nursing degree before the novel begins. Thereâs a scene where they look at a photo of her in her graduation uniform. Early in the book, the narrator falls in love with a young man whose family is aligned with the Nazi Party â but he himself is not. Thereâs a moment when her father asks what kind of life she would have with his family, and the man says something to the effect of, your family will be our family, like I'll have nothing to do with them if I can be with your daughter. Soon after, he disappears. The adopted sister goes to investigate and reports that heâs joined the Nazi Party. The two women end up escaping to America together before the situation worsens. I think the Jewish girl might be pregnant. In America, there are a few memorable adjustment scenes â like confusion over supper vs. dinner, or someone comparing German vs. American potato salad at a picnic or barbecue. Okay, that's as much as I can say without giving up spoilers. Anyone????

She ends up coming across a super attractive guy who immediately is like, sheâs the one (to himself). Heâs so attracted he gets her off on her own and they do it, but I seem to recall it was FMCâs first time. Just as theyâre getting ready to actually talk etc. the fire alarm goes off and they escape but MMC tells her to stay put outside while he goes off to help. His mother ends up being transported to the hospital for smoke inhalation and he goes with her, missing his chance to find the woman. He hires PIâs to find her but they come up empty with no name to go on. Fast forward a few months, sheâs pregnant with MMCâs baby, but bestie wants to pretend their engaged both for her sake and to help clean up the partying image he built when he was reckless after the guysâ father died. Sheâs going home to the family estate to have Christmas with his family, but heâs running late due to work so she goes ahead. When she gets to the estate, she runs into MMC/baby daddy and he goes full caveman possessive. Drags her to his room, has her things delivered there, and is adamant he doesnât care whose baby it is, sheâs his and staying his.

goodreads	23174215	1	Sophia Hardy-Weinberg	2025-07-12T00:00:00Z	Hello, everyone. Many years ago I read a book probably published around the years 1990-2010 (I know that's a pretty big range; my apologies) by one of these publishers: Harlequin Enterprises, Silhouette Books, or Mills & Boon. Here are some details I remember: - I would say it's a second-chance romance because if I recall correctly, they are recently married, but he leaves their honeymoon/vacation trip for some business duties. - The male protagonist is a plant crop scientist (probably a botanist, or a biologist, or even an agronomist) and partner of a high-tech company. - For the scientific goals of his most recent research project, he must be confined in a glass dome facility, much like in the actual Biosphere 2 project. - He and the female protagonist are in a tattered relationship. She left him because his work always comes first in his list of priorities, and she wants to build a family. I can't remember exactly, but my guess is that she works for the press (or not). - By the end of the book, she learns she is pregnant after a brief reconciliation, and there's a scene where she wears a protective suit to talk to him through a glass wall that separates the scientists inside the dome from the exterior world and avoid contamination. I appreciate any help anyone can provide on this.

goodreads	23175045	1	Lydia Marriott	2025-07-13T00:00:00Z	Hello, I hope this gives enough information, I've been looking for this book for years! It's the first book I willingly read, bought and read in 96/97. It was recommended to me by a bookseller in a children's book shop. My memory fo the plot is vague so I'll do my best. It's set during the war (not sure if I or II) about a teenage girl sent to the rural south coast to stay with, I think, two aunts who live in a little cottage with a much loved garden. The girl might be a little wayward, maybe that's why she's been sent away. She walks the coastal paths regularly and meets a boy/man and they have rendezvous in a cave I think. She might get pregnant and give birth in a tin bath tub with her aunt helping her. That's pretty much all I can remember and a lot of that is not certain which is probably I've not been able to find it! Any suggestions would be much appreciated but I realise it's a very long shot!

goodreads	23176482	1	Sa Pi	2025-07-15T00:00:00Z	Hello, I hope this gives enough information, I've been looking for this book for a while, and I do remember a few detailed scenes. I found this book from booktok and I'm pretty sure I read it in the last 3 years, could not be over that. 1. The mmc calls the fmc 'hollywood', because the first time they met, they sort of crashed each others car and the fmc panicked and blamed it on the mmc. Ever since, the mmc thinks she's spoiled which stated the nickname, and their enemies-to-lovers banter. 2. The fmc had just moved into the a new dorm with her new roomates. And apparently her roomates are actually close friends with mmc. The fmc is struggling in math (i think) and her roomates suggest the mmc to help tutor her. 3. The fmc parents are a bit pressuring, with her dad obligating straight A grades and her mom with her high beauty expectations. The mmc parent on the other hand divorced from a young age. His dad left for another women and his mom dying due to alcohol poisoning. BIG PART!!! --> The mmc has synesthesia, where he can see sounds and remember his past very well. Like he vividly remembers his mother dying and can still smell the alcohol (he hates alcohol). --- He also says that everytime the fmc speaks, he sees blue and yellow lightning. 4. There's this scene, where th mmc was staying at the fmc dorm (since his friends with her rromates), beacuse there was a party going on in his dorm and he doesn't like it. And then the fmc was going on a date with another guy and that guy bought her flowers (red roses if i'm not wrong). But when the fmc wakes up the next morning, the flowers are in the trash and new flowers are in a vase (it was a blue and yellow flower, could be blue iris and moon-something). 5. The fmc also has a weirdly big obsession with mugs and the mmc once gave her a halloween mug (or cowboy) as an apology or gift. 6. The mmc hates having people in his room, but has once let the fmc in a while before they started becoming acquaintances. And that's because her old friend (which is now the head sorority) let another guy drugges her drink at a party so she could kick the fmc out of the sorority. He also once let her stayed over (during tutoring sessions) and borrowed a (full-body?) mirror just for her. 7. He has a secret youtube account in which he post anonymously of him playing an instrument, which the fmc loves to listen to. 8. There was also a scene where her car breaks down at night and she decideds to call him, and even though he was at a party, he left immedietly to get her. 9. There was also a scene where the fmc was going to give the mmc a treat (rice-krispy), but when she gets to his room, there was another girl wearing his shirt (his relative btw), and he was in the shower. So she decided to bolt and the mmc went chasing in his towel to explain. Anyways, any suggestions would be much appreciated even if it doesn't fit all the scenes. Thank you!

Itâs a college romance / new adult novel in English. What I remember from the plot: - The main character goes to her boyfriendâs apartment and finds him cheating on her. She runs away, and her boyfriend chases her. - Another guy (the real love interest) helps her hide in his sisterâs apartment. He takes care of her. Heâs always been secretly in love with her. - The sister writes about them in the college newspaper, but the protagonist doesnât realize itâs their own story. Eventually she finds out the truth â that her ex only dated her to get back at the real love interest out of envy or revenge. Iâd really appreciate any help identifying this book. Thank you so much in advance!

There was an old dog with the sisters Petunia and Pansy. This is the dog that in one chapter was stealing eggs from the hen house so Pansy or Petunia put an egg in there that had been stuffed with red pepper. However, the dog went up the mountain and found the old moonshine corn mash and came back down a little sloshed. The dog found the pepper loaded egg, walked through the pen where the bull was, the egg balanced in his lips. He dropped the egg when the bull snorted, left the pen, then the bull ran forward, sniffed the egg, and bit it. Fireworks ensued. Additionally, there was a man involved in the story along with revenuers. Finally, there may have been one or two more book in this series.	unusable			series

At first I thought the main character was a girl, but now Iâm second guessing myself. I remember the cover being of a foyer (maybe). I think in the beginning the girl runs away from her job assignment ceremony and hides out in a boat, then finding refuge in this magic house wherein the rooms move around. SPOILER: the clearest remembered scene from this book is when her and a boy go through one particular door and are transported to a battlefield of skeletons and she holds her breath to be invisible. Sorry if this is rough and confused, itâs been a while. I think I also remember her being sent to an orphanage or something near the end of the book. TY!

In the first book, the protagonist used to ride at a stable in her old city on a borrowed horse, and her parents promised to buy her her own horse to help her adjust to a big move to a more rural town (for work). When they arrive, due to financial hardships they cannot buy the horse. She sneakily finds a horse online and organises to buy it over the phone. Her parents find out when the owner arrives to drop the horse off and are very mad, they send the horse back. She ends up finding an abandoned horse at a dilapidated shed which she begins to care for. 90% sure it is a chestnut mare called honey (but I may have gaslighted myself after many dead end searches). She starts a job in order to look after the horse herself as her parents agreed she can keep the horse if she pays for all the expenses, and begins going to the local riding school. She befriends one girl, but there is a group who are mean to her, one is a red-haired girl, and another is a boy with an odd nickname (like rat maybe?). Other books in the series include her going to a camp, where the red-haired bullies cousin pretends to be her friend but makes her time very hard and ostracizes her from the other girls (e.g. frames her for stealing another girls bracelet given to her by her sister). Another book includes her learning how to do endurace riding, or maybe eventing. Theres also an issue where the horses old owner tries to take the horse back now that its healthy and is doing well In later books the boy that's a bully develops a crush on her.

goodreads	23181161	1	Brandon	2025-07-22T00:00:00Z	"The book was fiction, a chapter book, probably under 200 pages. It was likely written in the 1970s or 1980s. Written in English for pre-teens or teenage readers. I read the book in 1998 while in junior high school. The story takes place somewhere in the United States in the 1970s or 1980s, possibly early 1990s but I doubt it - that would have been way too modern for my public school. The main character of the story is a teenage girl who comes from a poor family and is not terribly popular at her school. She suffers from a lack of confidence until she encounters an older wealthy woman who takes a liking to her and wants to take her to Europe. Her mother and father reluctantly agree to let her go. I remember a distinct detail is when the older woman visits the girl's home to meet her parents and ask for their permission to take their daughter to Europe, the mom serves drinks on a metal tray that has beer logos on it, and this embarasses the young girl. At the end of the meeting Dad says, """"I guess we'll go get you a passport."""" Although I did not finish the book I suspect that the wealthy woman was not all that she revealed herself to be and her true intentions were possibly sinister and would be revealed later in the story but this is speculation on my part."

Any help would be amazing! Sarah had meticulously built a life for herself and her daughter, Lily, after divorcing Mark years ago. They were comfortable, if not extravagant, and Lily was on the fast track to medical school, a dream Sarah had encouraged with all her heart. Then, the call came. Mark, Sarah's ex-husband, had died unexpectedly. A few weeks later, a somber lawyer informed Sarah that Mark had bequeathed a significant share of his family's business to her. The business? A charming, rustic resort nestled by a pristine lake, offering fishing charters as its main draw. Sarah, despite her initial apprehension about re-entering the world of Mark's family, knew she had to investigate. The resort, """"Lakeside Haven,"""" was even more beautiful than she remembered. Sun-drenched cabins hugged the shoreline, and the scent of pine and fresh fish lingered in the air. Lily, initially wary of the rural setting, found herself drawn to the calm, introspective nature of the place. They both, surprisingly, found a flicker of unexpected romance amidst the serene surroundings. Sarah, still reeling from the sudden changes in her life, found herself captivated by the resort's charismatic fishing charter captain, a man whose easygoing humor and genuine love for the lake offered a comforting contrast to her previously structured life. Meanwhile, Lily, amidst the vibrant energy of the resort staff and the natural beauty, developed a connection with a charming local park ranger who shared her passion for the environment and the quiet moments nature provided. The peaceful atmosphere and the blossoming relationships stirred something within Lily. The rigorous demands of medical school, once her unwavering goal, began to feel less like a calling and more like a carefully constructed expectation. She found herself questioning if the life she had envisioned for herself was truly the one she desired, or simply the path she thought she was supposed to follow. The resort, with its simple rhythms and honest work, offered an appealing alternative, causing her to seriously reconsider her path to medical school."

goodreads	23183003	1	Courtney Emerson	2025-07-24T00:00:00Z	Hi! I'm trying to remember the title of a book I read sometime between 2015 and 2019, most likely during the summer. It was a domestic suspense novel told from the mother's point of view. The story centered around a married couple with a young son (around 3â5 years old, I think his nickname or name was âBearâ). One day, the father takes their son without warning and disappears. The mother initially doesnât know if it was a kidnapping or something worse, so she involves the police but also investigates on her ownâdigging through the fatherâs things and tracking phone records. Throughout the book, the mother also tells of how she met her husband. I am remembering it was some sort of a meet-cute involving both of their work, ex: a project where both employers were needed. Eventually, itâs revealed that the father took the child to a family cabin, possibly in California (maybe one of the Carolinas), and they were staying with his sister. Thereâs a twist where the father has to drug himself with pain meds (prescribed by a dentist I think) to appear asleepâpossibly because the sister was holding him there against his will or he was trying to avoid suspicion. I think the aunt was trying to convince him to not return and she would help in raising the son. In the end, the parents reconcile and claim to the police that it was all a miscommunication, but the mother makes it clear she no longer fully trusts him to be alone with their son. The last scene is the three of them together on a beach, with the mother reminiscing on whatâs happened & watching the father and son go to the hotel room. I believe the title included the word find or foundâsomething like I Had to Find Youâand the cover may have featured a blurred beach scene with black stripes. I also think the authorâs first name might have been Jessica. Any ideas?	unusable

She has a foul-mouthed angel that is supposed to guide her. She falls in love with a man (maybe). I remember he has to make himself bleed to appease a tree or something like that. The woman is taken to a type of hell & is possessed by a goddess (?) but the king of that place realizes he like the human girl not the goddess. The woman somehow comes back to herself & escapes the hell place. I know Iâve read it in the last 4-5 years.	unusable			book series

goodreads	23183063	1	Courtney Emerson	2025-07-24T00:00:00Z	Hi! I'm trying to remember the title of a book I read sometime between 2015 and 2019, most likely during the summer. It was a domestic suspense novel told from the mother's point of view. The story centered around a married couple with a young son (around 3â5 years old, I think his nickname or name was âBearâ). One day, the father takes their son without warning and disappears. The mother initially doesnât know if it was a kidnapping or something worse, so she involves the police but also investigates on her ownâdigging through the fatherâs things and tracking phone records. Throughout the book, the mother also tells of how she met her husband. I am remembering it was some sort of a meet-cute involving both of their work, ex: a project where both employers were needed. Eventually, itâs revealed that the father took the child to a family cabin, possibly in California (maybe one of the Carolinas), and they were staying with his sister. Thereâs a twist where the father has to drug himself with pain meds (prescribed by a dentist I think) to appear asleepâpossibly because the sister was holding him there against his will or he was trying to avoid suspicion. I think the aunt was trying to convince him to not return and she would help in raising the son. In the end, the parents reconcile and claim to the police that it was all a miscommunication, but the mother makes it clear she no longer fully trusts him to be alone with their son. The last scene is the three of them together on a beach, with the mother reminiscing on whatâs happened & watching the father and son go to the hotel room. I believe the title included the word find or foundâsomething like I Had to Find Youâand the cover may have featured a blurred beach scene with black stripes. I also think the authorâs first name might have been Jessica. Any ideas?

goodreads	23183638	1	Pony Xaviors	2025-07-25T00:00:00Z	Hey, all! So I'm trying to help my aunt find a book she read back in high school. This would've been in the '80s, although she doesn't know for sure when it was published. She read it in the US, so it may have been published there. Here's what I know of the plot: There are two brothers, both of them older men (I think maybe elderly), who live together. One of the brothers is blind, so the other brother helps take care of him. The seeing brother believes that the blind brother's sight can be healed or restored, and keeps giving him oranges to eat because he thinks the Vitamin C will cure his sight. Because of that, they have orange peels lying around the house everywhere. The seeing brother also hoards newspapers and has stacks of them all over the house. He wants his blind brother to be able to read them all himself and catch up on all the news he missed, when he can see again. SPOILERS AHEAD: At some point, the seeing brother has a heart attack and dies. Because the blind brother doesn't have any one to take care of him, he also eventually dies alone in the house. Apparently, some people end up finding the bodies and are trying to sort out what happened and why there are newspapers and orange peels everywhere, and they believe the brothers were hoarders. I don't know if this happens at the end of the book, or if that's how the book began and the rest was them figuring out what had happened. My aunt said she thought it had a sort of moral to the story of not judging things by what you see, when you don't know the whole story. I think that's everything. Any help would be appreciated. I'll send any suggestions to my aunt. Thank you in advance!

She tells him she had to move from her old house because the neighbors found out she is a witch and made her unwelcome. In the move, she lost her cookbook or spell book with the recipes for her spells. Once, she made iced tea come out from the faucet, useful for a party. A spell goes wrong and the whole backyard is filled with mint jelly. The book was lost during the move. They go to auctions and garage sales looking for cookbooks. They buy many boxes and books without finding her book. Eventually, they find it. The older woman is scared of being discovered as a witch. She lived for many years in her old town and had many friends. After many years, she decided to tell them she is a witch. She hosted a party at her home. Instead of being pleased, her former friends run away from her home. They told stories about how she was bad and tried to hurt them. She had to move away and is starting all over in this new town. The boy has a mother and maybe a younger sister. He is not old enough to drive. They live close by, next door or down the street. Read this in southern USA, somewhere between 1988 and 1995. It was a paperback from the public library or elementary school library.

goodreads	23186032	1	Aubriana Ellis	2025-07-28T00:00:00Z	I read this book series within the last five years. The author enjoyed using alliteration in their titles, which reminded me of Lemony Snicket at the time. However, Iâm fairly certain the author was a woman. The heroine of the seriesâ though it is later revealed the narrator is her male friendâ goes to school with a girl who keeps giving her used lip gloss out of pity. In the first book, the girl meets the first of her two male friends, and they try and rescue a talented boy their age who has synesthesia. They find out a cult, led by a really old blonde lady, has been using the brains of children with synesthesia to give themselves eternal youth. The blonde lady is revealed to have led her her kind-of boyfriend to run away from a circus when he was creepily very young (she was already who knows how old) resulting in him abandoning his identical twin brother, who was thought to be murdered in a house fire at the beginning of the book, but is revealed to be alive. The twin brothers also have synesthesia, and they created a secret code only the two of them understood using the ability. The girl falls in love with her second male friend and her first male friend is revealed to be the narrator. Sorry for making this insanely long! If you read this, thank you SO MUCH!	unusable			series: The Secret Series by Pseudonymous Bosch

Their mother(?) is kidnapped early on during a big battle. The sister (I think her name was Seliah) plays a lyre which was super important because it could be magical too. There may have been small colored stones that tied into the lyres magic and activating it, they also may have been related to something else. There was also an 'alternate' demension that was bright white that was super important in the climax of the story, this is where she learns more about the lyres magic I think. It was a dark paperback cover that had an embossed lyre, possibly with rainbow strings. No idea of author initals or name length, same for the title of the book. I know it was bought new for me around the time I read it. I know its not: (common recommendations I've checked) Song of the Lyre Dragonbard series Talon I was youngish when I read this and I lost the book years ago, so I apologize if some of my details are a little vague.	unusable			book series
