whatsthatmoviecalled	1kuoby4	0	OIlIIIll0	2025-05-24T23:05:22Z	Movie from the 80s Trying to see if anyone can figure out this movie, it was one of my favorites as a kid and I dont know anyone else that knows it. Starts out with a boy in Sweden who lives with his abusive aunt and uncle. Gets whisked off to a foreign land where he goes on an adventure and fights an evil knight in a castle who turns boys into ravens. At the end of the movie he finds out his dad is the king of the land and he lives with his new best friend who accompanied him on his adventure.

NameThatMovie	1lc0vs8	0	jbyak1947	2025-06-15T13:54:27Z	Can anyone help me with the name of this horror movie/show , seen in early/mid nineties on tv I have always wondered what movie/show this was since seeing as a kid. Aired early to mid nineties when I was 5/7 years old. Somewhere around then on cable TV There was a man and woman, they go to this old mansion, can't remember why. While there at least one of them drinks or eats some kind of green goo. Then it shows their body melt an turn into the goo, all of these creatures come out of rooms of the house and eat the person's body while it turns into the goo while the head remains, seems like there may have been a person at the mansion in control of the creatures.Later on it shows the woman's head in the hospital, while the man looks, and talks to her, head only no body. I know it's vague an a long shot, but I seen this as a kid an ive wonderd about it for 25 years , never could identify it. I could never remember much more , but I remember it scared the crap out of me as a kid, and those are the parts I remembered. Thanks				mixes up two movies

NameThatMovie	1lc0vs8	6	Moist_Look_3039	2025-06-18T08:05:02Z	like everybody else mentioned, the creatures eating the goo part is Troll 2. But the second part you're remembering is probably Return of the Living Dead, where a character speaks with the top half of a female zombie strapped to a mortuary slab. Or it's possible you reversed the genders and are thinking of a different green goo movie, Re-Animator, where it's a woman talking to a man's severed head, also in a mortuary.

whatsthemoviecalled	1khb70a	0	GarbageChuteFuneral	2025-05-07T22:58:43Z	Dark erotic thriller. Not an easy one... I think I watched this movie in very early 90s. It was an erotic thriller. I feel like it might have had a cheap, TV-movie quality to it, but probably a direct-to-video title due to its seemingly very dark themes. Maybe the picture had a greenish tint? The main character was a dude who had been married to a transgender person without knowing it. Someone at some point in the movie mocked the main character, saying something along the lines: """"""""How could you not have known? You only fucked her in the ass in the dark? What did she tell you? That her pussy is too tight?"""""""" I think the one saying this could have been an evil, manipulative woman the main dude was now maybe having some sort of affair with. A scene in the movie, I think the final scene, had the manipulative woman call the police and leave the telephone receiver on a table, and then she coaxed the dude to rape her. So the dude commenced raping her while screaming something about how he was raping her, for the cops to hear. Now I feel like maybe there was also a scene where he was in prison after that. Also, possibly, the dude was repeatedly watching and rewinding some VHS tapes for some reason. Possibly some sort of surveillance or session tapes? Memory is very hazy, I might even be mixing this up with a different film here. That's all I recall. I really would like to know what this was, but I don't have very high hopes of anyone knowing this one.

whatsthemoviecalled	1lat8y7	0	QuickBite2123	2025-06-13T22:38:19Z	A 3D animation about a little girl going after a garbage truck to retrieve her radio I remember watching a movie as a kid where the parents of a little girl threw her radio in the trash and she ran after/jumped in the truck to get it back. And when she got there there were furnitures talking and moving. I definitely remember a lamp/street light looking at her and then acting like a lifeless object when she looks at it. There was an old armchair and a furnace with something like a treadmill in front of it. The girl was put on there and she tried to run away. I don't really remember much but i guess her name was Alice. I looked it up years ago and found nothing except a short, german dubbed 144p youtube video but i can't find it again. It might be a 2d but i doubt it. I'm 21 years old. So it's gotta be before 2010-2013 or something.

I remember only seeing it once so I don't have many details. This is what little I can remember: -The movie was Live Action -It was transmitted on a kid channel, most probably Disney Channel, so it must be PG-13 rated or less. -The lead character was a girl (I think she was blond), who lives with unloving parents. -There was a disaster (I think it was an earthquake) that forced her to move away. On this note, I remember the scene about the disaster being about the girl hiding under a bed and hearing people screaming and there were soem stuff that got set on fire. -She moved with some relatives that lived in a gigantic Victorian house and there she meets a kid that turns out to be her cousin. I think the cousin was disabled or something like that as I think that he was sitting down in all of his scenes. -I seem to recall the cousin starting to have a crush on her but the girl reminds him they are relatives. These are some looses details and I hhave no idea of the overall plot. Maybe I am just mixing various movies into one in my memories. But if anyone can identify a movie similar to this, please let me know.

NameThatMovie	1le0lhk	0	CHICKADEE7dee	2025-06-17T22:16:25Z	Need help finding this movie So i know this is probably a longshot, but here goes... I'm looking for the name of a movie but only remember bits and pieces. I believe it came out around 2015-2020, but it could be as early as 2010. There was some sort of facility or bunker (possibly government run) where everyone is told to stay inside cuz the air outside was contaminated. There were soldiers or security officers with guns, to maintain order. There was 2 teens (siblings maybe) that snuck outside and realized the air was fine and that they were all being lied to. I think the teens' parents were also living in the facility, and one parent (mom i believe) got sick and was quarantined and the teens weren't allowed to see her. The teens start sneaking around the facility to find out what happened to their mom. Idr if they were told the mom died but it was a lie and the people in charge were actually doing experiments or something on her? After they realize they are being lied to, that's when they decide to escape from the facility. I don't know if they were allowed back inside. I remember it as a disaster/survival type drama, but i could be mixing it up with another movie. I can't remember much else, except that it seemed to be a sterile facility.	unsolved			
NameThatMovie	1le0lhk	4	CHICKADEE7dee	2025-06-17T22:20:59Z	Any help would be appreciated. Something may jog my memory and help me remember more details i can give. This has been driving me nuts for years. Edit to add: I believe i watched this movie before i moved to my current house, june 2018. So i must've watched it sometime between 2009- 2018. Not sure if it was new at the time. I had netflix &amp; hulu, but it could also have been on tubi or pluto. I'm gonna check my watch history on tubi &amp; pluto, if it has that option or even goes back that far. Are there any other ways, besides IMDb, to search for movies using the description? I've searched IMDb endlessly and can't find it. Thanks for all the suggestions given. I appreciate the help	unsolved

I'm almost certain it was a movie, not a tv show. I only had netflix and hulu at the time, so that may narrow it down some. Also, all the people were clean, facility was clean, so it had to be a recent event that contaminated the air. Idt the people were in the facility that long, maybe less than a year.

Had a good amount of advertising, but I don't think it did well with ratings since I haven't heard of it since. I can hardly remember anything about it, but I know it was a paranormal horror. I think it was based in like... India? Somewhere in a tropical forest I believe, but it was American produced. She was in this beautiful, huge house and there was a fountain in the middle where the house's ceiling opened up. Pretty sure there was a scene where some kind of demon tried drowning her in it, or a scene where the water turned black like tar. I'm think it came out around 2015 because I'm pretty sure we rented it when we rented Magic Mike XXL LMAO Sorry, but that's really all I can remember.

Movie about a group of friends trying to save their favorite bar So I remembered seeing this Comedy movie in one of those cable channels that had so many films from all over the world, so if I remember correctly I remember all the actors had an English accent and all film locations were probably from the UK as well as the atmosphere. The protagonists were these guys of different ages mostly middle aged and one or two young ones that used to gather at a bar. They mostly are a little dumb and a little weird There are some scenes I clearly remember and are as follows: 1 - These guys used to admire this man who liked to kick trash cans all the way into garbage trucks and the drivers would thank him for doing so, then the protagonists would try to do the same but they would fail miserably kicking the trash and falling over 2 - There is an auction almost at the end of the movie where they are selling the bar that they are trying to save, so there is this guy who fell asleep during the auction so these guys tie a string to one of his hands and whenever they wanted to outbid the rest of the buyers they would lift the string and the sleeping guy would outbid the competition by lifting his hand thanks to the string attached to one of these guys. This goes on for some times until the string gets stuck and they pull so hard they lift the guy all the way to the ceiling. Funniest scene of the movie. That's about it, probably wouldn't be enough to find the movie but since this was a one time viewing I have a hard time remembering everything. The image seemed kinda 80s old European movie format Thanks for helping!

whatsthemoviecalled	1l5bmlo	2_1_1_1	Sea_Difficulty8258	2025-06-07T09:02:48Z	It starts off strong and interesting. Imagine being gifted a shovel and being told that ten feet below you is a treasure chest full of millions of dollars and priceless jewels. So you start digging and digging and finally you get ten feet deep and realize that there is no treasure chest and you are now stuck in a ten foot deep hole wondering how you let yourself get sucked into something so deep that really doesn't make any sense. of course I'm being hyperbolic, but sheesh that's how the movie made me feel

The film follows a Woman journalist? from the UK? to a tent in the American? desert inhabited by a death cult? and a serial killer. The cult members allow themselves to be ritualistically murdered over several days by the serial killer. 90% of the film takes place inside of a white tent? in the desert. the final scene is that of the serial killer getting in his car and driving away. not 100% on any of the details as i am only going off my memory of a single veiwing i do remember the first killing was with a knife. i cant remember if the leader was pretending to run a cult so he could kill people or if the followers knew about what was going to happen. Please do not say The Sacrament. When I say extremely violent I mean extremely violent and disturbing. I remember bits and pieces from a single veiwing over 15 years ago.

whatsthemoviecalled	1liuc1r	2	Illustrious-Note-126	2025-06-23T23:56:50Z	I came up with a couple possibilities based on your description and the following movie descriptions. I've not seen either. Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon (2006) 39: A film by Carroll McKane (2006) I also found this list of found footage movies. I looked through most, but nothing struck me as being quite what you described. Maybe you can browse it and something will look familiar. Wish I could be more helpful. https://www.imdb.com/list/ls063914804/?sort=release_date%2Casc				
whatsthemoviecalled	1liuc1r	2_1	SacredAnchovy	2025-06-24T17:20:09Z	Definitely not Rise of Leslie Vernon. Phenomenal movie, but doesn't match the description OP gave. I haven't seen 39.				
whatsthemoviecalled	1liuc1r	2_2	Oppppiegod	2025-06-24T18:12:27Z	Thank you for taking the time to respond. I have watched behind the mask. This Movie that I am referring to is really low budget Blair witch style not really scary as much as deeply disturbing, disturbingenough for me to have remembered it. I have searched far and wide for this film to no avail,I have also checked the list you are referring to and to my knowledge it isn't on the list I have watched most of the list. Maybe the movie is from the 1990s? I first found the film by accident it just played after a movie I was watching on Comcast on demand back around 2010? I am not even sure of the date. I remember it clearly though I was watching it at my grandma's house when I was staying there after moving back to Ohio. It played directly after another low budget horror found footage film of a group of friends breaking into an abandoned prison that was basically a portal to hell. In that film which I can't recall the name of either one of the inmates when the prison was still operational wrote incantations all over the walls of his cell bringing demonic entities into the prison possessing the inmates who began rioting killing everyone in a fire? (Not sure about the fire) and mass slaughter. If I can find either of these movies I might be able to find the other. The film I really want to see again with more mature and wiser eyes is the film described in the op. Like I said the film starts off with a girl going to the airport I am not sure if she was suicidal and documenting the journey or a journalist or both I want to say she was coming from the UK but maybe she was Australian. Maybe the movie is Australian. I know that the leader of this cult or group of people that just want to die tricked all of the people in the group. The group a wore white robes and I am pretty sure they were in a canvas tent in either the Australian outback or American desert. The only reason I thought it was America is because at one point the sort of leader had a shotgun in one scene at least and it is possible that he shot the camera at the end of the film before getting into his brown muscle car and driving away or maybe the girl was still alive and shot him or went with him idk just need ideas

There was 2 people (I think - could have been 3/4) who were trying to travel across a derelict/abandoned partially wooded landscape - there were concrete features and holes/tunnels in the ground and loads of clinical waste (used syringes etc.) In order to find a safe route across the landscape they had to throw something in the air, and then they could walk to wherever the thing had landed.

I think the flashbacks were in black or white. A person had been murdered (stabbed to death with scissors?) and the person who was accused of killing them was on death row I think? In the flash back someone is leaning in to hear the accused say something. Later in the film you find out the accused didn't say anything, they just kissed the person on the cheek.

I watched this movie at my grandmas house around 1997 but it could have been out for a while. My cousins and I were far too young to be watching at that time unsupervised. I remember a story about a brother and sister who were for some reason separated at birth or really young. The girl went on to live a semi normal life but the boy was sent to a farm in a remote area with at least 3 creepy evil sisters that all looked the same and also there are abusive and scary farmer parents that adopted him. The sister tries to find the brother throughout the movie. Some highlights that have haunted me: 1. A scene where an animal (a pig I think) is hung up on a hook and bled out into a bucket. The farmer makes the boy watch in horror. 2. There is a big scene or repeated scene where the one of the kids is looking out a window of a moving car as trees pass by. The shot is of the kids POV. 3. The biggest clue. The boy is a little older and for some reason the evil sisters sew his eyes and mouth shut and he is sat at the dining table. I want to say the movie culminates with the sister finding him this way and saving him.

whatsthemoviecalled	1k4ylyc	6	kingofnothing2514	2025-04-22T15:29:28Z	Chat gpt answer. Based on your vivid recollections, the film you're describing sounds like *The Other Woman* (also known as *The Other Woman: A Story of the Evil Sisters*), a 1992 TV movie directed by Paul Schneider. This psychological horror film involves a young boy who is separated from his sister at birth and adopted by a sinister family with three identical, malevolent sisters. The boy endures horrific abuse, including a scene where his eyes and mouth are sewn shut, and is forced to witness animal slaughter. Meanwhile, his sister embarks on a quest to find and rescue him. The film's unsettling atmosphere and disturbing imagery, such as the repeated scenes of a child looking out a car window as trees pass by, align with your memories. Given that you watched it around 1997, it's plausible that it had been airing on television for some time before then, possibly on networks like Lifetime or USA, which often featured such made-for-TV thrillers. If this doesn't seem to match, please let me know, and we can explore other possibilities.				
whatsthemoviecalled	1k4ylyc	6_1	Beccasaurus21	2025-04-22T16:23:26Z	Ok this sounds 100% spot on - but when I googled all variations of this films name I am unable to find any presence or mention of it on the internet. So potentially solved by AI, but unable to verify!

I remember it very vaguely so the details probably are not exact. It has to have been made some time between 2010 and. It almost had a Legend of Zelda (the new one) kind of feel. There is this man who is in this video game like world (No, it's not Free Guy or Ready Player One) and he meets this girl who he then has a kid with. They are all very happy until one day the kid gets kidnapped (maybe the wife too I can't remember). He goes on a journey to get them back and picks up some help (I don't remember exactly if it was mystical creatures or real people but I'm very certain that it had a mystical creature element). He brings them all together to fight this man who has his son (and possibly wife) and when he finds him and they go to war, the guy has all these magical powers and says he is some kind of hacker. He is keeping the son in the floating yellowish orb. He finally gets close to defeating the """"""""hacker"""""""" guy but then the hacker dude freezes time and everything goes black and white. Everything is frozen except the main dude and the hacker guy. The hacker guy tries to tell him none of it is real and I'm pretty sure that the hacker guy lets him win and as the main character is about to touch his son, there is a flash of light and he wakes up in this tank like thing and gets out and he is just at this video game fair thing testing the newest tech.

I want to say it was heavily focused on an older mother and a son. I want to say it was something along the lines of journey/trip in the title, and it was a town name, I believe in Texas. Im hoping this is enough to nail it down. Ill 100% know it when I see it. Thank you so much, Reddit! Edit: I believe it is set pre-2000s, and possibly came out before the 2000s as well.

In it, somebody I remember looking a bit like Spencer Tracy, in some kind of uniform, is walking on clouds, probably dead. It's *not* """"""""A matter of life and death"""""""", or """"""""A guy named Joe"""""""" which I watched today. ---- The second is a telefilm, something maybe out of """"""""The Twilight Zone"""""""". A dollhouse with real people inside and some child playing with them. --- Very fragmentary memories of them, probably because I watched them as a child.

whatmoviewasthat	1lfbqrm	0	Interesting_Term8393	2025-06-19T14:08:59Z	Need help with remembering the name of this movie There was this comedy Murder mystery I can't remember the name of but I remember a bit from the movie. The beginning had an old couple get into a car at night about to leave their mansion but the husband had to get out and smoke a cigarette I think it was. When he gets back inside of the car. His wife is dead or knocked out unconscious and he doesn't realized it and then gets knocked out unconscious as well by someone hiding in the back seat. Then the person rigs the car to drive off the bridge that connected to their mansion which killed and drown them. The next has like two buddies who I think are detectives driving into the castle mansion to investigate the case. I just remember them being something like a comedy duo like Abbott and Costello (originally thought it was them). They drive in the mansion and meet the daughter heiress of the couple that just died. She does the introductions and has the servants introduces themselves. One of the servants I remember was a tall butcher dude who can't speak properly because he had his tounge cut off for stealing. So whenever he talks he sounds like he is mumbling I remember that scene well because one of the detectives asked his partner if he understood what he said when the butcher introduced himself and his partner said yes and started mumble talking exactly like what the dude said. The detective duo go around trying to figure out who the killer is but we see the killer wearing a black hoodie or drape (kinda like the slasher guy from the scream horror movies) following them around. As the movie progresses. They end up finding each servant slowly being killed one by one in the mansion. I think one of the deaths had a servant choked to death by a statue hand. Eventually at the end of the movie we see the killer filling up a large bag with money that is the inheritance money the old couple had who died in the beginning of the movie. The detectives find the killer and the killer turns out to be a woman who was a lover of the the old man. She holds the detectives at gunpoint ready to get away in a car before another person in a black drape that is huge slowly appears and approaches right behind her. She turns around and sees the thing. She shoots her gun at it but it does nothing and keeps coming towards her before she finally faints from horror. The mysterious hooded figure then turns to the detectives and reveals himself to be the husband of the old couple who """"""""died"""""""" in the beginning of the movie. Finally we're at the end of the movie and detectives are leaving and I think the servants were all magically alive again somehow. I think it because the butcher guy who can't talk gifts the detectives a coffin box. The detectives drive off and it turns out there was like Frankenstein in the box and it scares them showing the final scene of the car swerving side to side on the road before the movies ends.

NameThatMovie	1kpwj0f	0	TheLemonWriter	2025-05-18T22:38:33Z	Movie from childhood?? I've had this movie that I watched ages ago stuck on my mind and I cannot for the life of me remember the name or any scene enough to get a straight answer from google. The movie (I'm pretty sure) is about a man and his daughter. The man is a bit of an alcoholic and gets into some kind of car accident or something. The girl, his daughter, happens to be in her school bus and witnesses it. She's doing her makeup in the back of the bus - pretty sure there's a fake mole, blue eyeshadow, and overly filled in eyebrows (classic kids playing around with makeup for the first time). From the back of the bus this guys daughter can see what happens and then somehow gets to the hospital where her dad is. There's a scene where she's with him the hospital and she's crying and a tear drops from her heavily mascaraed eyelash and onto him... can't remember if it was in his mouth or on his cheek or somewhere else. Another big part of the movie (that I think I'm remembering correctly unless my childhood memories are smashing to very different movies together) but viewers are able to see what the characters eat. Kind of like with Inside Out and the characters/emotions in the brain, in this movie the the stomach is personified?? Like whenever the dad eats or drinks something a scene change goes into his stomach and there's little figures in there taking notes on what he ate and whether or not it's good for him. I remember a specific scene where either dad or daughter is eating those graham cracker bears or teddy grahams and it flows through the digestive track and into the stomach and the stomach figure people make comments on the choice of snack. Am I crazy?? I swear this is real and I need to find it because it's driving me insane.

He doesnt own a TV, so at one point, he draws a television on the wall and sits in front of it like hes watching it. Later in the movie, a woman comes back to his house (possibly a date or someone he met). When shes getting ready to leave, he blocks the door. She laughs nervously, thinking hes joking  but it turns out hes completely serious and wont let her go. I dont remember if he hurt her, killed her, or held her hostage  the ending is fuzzy. The tone was unsettling, very quiet and creepy, not a slasher. It felt more psychological, but definitely horror. Pretty sure it was a full-length film, not a short or anthology segment.

whatsthemoviecalled	1kk3yk0	0	Wide-Payment751	2025-05-11T15:43:03Z	Hii! Im looking for this movie I saw a review of years ago that I'd love to watch. It was a movie where a group of people are all stuck in a room, each in a small circle, if they try to step out of it they'll die. Every few minutes they have to vote on a person to kill, so little by little they all die until it's only the protagonist left. At the end it's revealed that it was caused by aliens I believe? I think the point of the movie was to showcase how society prioritizes certain people (the unlikeable people died first while a child and a pregnant woman made it further) and that's what the aliens were studying? I saw the review years ago in one of those Movie Recap channels, I don't remember which one unfortunately =- If anyone can help me find the name of this movie it'd be much appreciated =O

I think it was an arranged marriage where the sons family would take her in and they kinda use her as a servant untill she grew up. the title might have someting to do with whisper/wind/rain/sound idk, but thats what it felt like the title was. it might have had alot of awards or 4/5 stars and ratings on the cover too.

There was a scene that's been stuck in my head where she is standing between them, struggling with who to choose. It's an outdoor scene. I thought it might be Summer Lovers, but it's not.

The problem with trying to identify movies I saw 40+ years ago is that I never know if what I remember is accurate. Having watched Summer Lovers and Personal Best recently, I've realized that I probably mixed those two together to come up with the movie I wrote about. The beach and the standing between them scene is from Summer Lovers, the bisexual protagonist is from Personal Best. Both came out in 1982 and I saw them very close to each other. I guess over 43 years my brain wore down the memories into one movie. Thank you so much for those of you who tried.	unsolved

It would've been from that time or the 90s. The main character gets into a drunk fight or something, and is inspired to take kung fu. He struggles at first (obviously) but then masters it. I just remember a scene after he's a kung fu master where he's playing tennis or some kind of racket sport, and he gets hit in the balls but it doesn't affect him. Then someone is like, """"""""you have balls of steel!"""""""" And he hits his balls and they make a metallic sound, demonstrating the validity of what they said. I know this is vague but it's all I remember. I've tried to find this movie many times but have never had any success.

The grown up child star was named David. The entire film they looked for a serial killer. The former child star was gay and teasing or otherwise involved with a younger fan. A lesbian woman was also somehow involved with another woman in the film. A few scenes I remember: The woman buys earrings for her female friend and asks the store ataff if they gift wrap. """"""""It's what we live for."""""""", was the reply. David is riding in his friend's car through a long tunnel and the passenger window doesn't work. """"""""It's broken."""""""", his friend said. In the last scene of the film, David is with his friend, who has been surrounded by police and they're on a rooftop. The friend/killer yells """""""" I did it for you, David!"""""""" And junps. Does anyone have any idea what this film is?

whatsthemoviecalled	1kj3e05	0	milk-and-cookies1214	2025-05-10T06:03:13Z	I saw a single clip of a movie years ago and have no idea what it is. So I was very young and I was up late one night when I was certainly not supposed to be. I was channel surfing when I landed on what I can only assume was a movie. I cant even remember if the movie was in English (I had a really nice cable package as a kid that included a lot of international channels haha). Anyways, this is the only clip I can remember and it is SO weird that it came into my brain recently so I wanted some help finding it: I have no context for the scene but I think a white(?) couple was naked in what looked like a cave(?). I dont remember much about the man, but the woman had a full bush (iconic) and very long black hair that went down to her waist and covered her breasts. They were lying together when another fully clothed white(?) man (I think he was in some kind of medieval outfit?) came into the scene and everyone started arguing. They all began to stand and yell, when the clothed man drew a sword. The naked man was backed into a corner and the naked woman shielded the naked man from the clothed man and his sword. They all continued to argue when I eventually changed the channel. Now that I think about it, Im honestly wondering if I accidentally watched some kind of dirty movie. But yea, if anyone has any idea what this scene belongs to Id love to know! Edit 1: this happened around 2005-ish on cable tv. I was around 9 or 10 Edit 2: the movie is confirmed to be [Monty Python's Life of Brian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python%27s_Life_of_Brian)

I just feel like if you had expectations for AHS that led you to be disappointed, you weren't judging it properly beforehand, like in whatever previous seasons you actually enjoyed. if that makes any sense lol. If you enjoyed previous seasons but then got to one or a few that you hated, you might have just gotten your hopes up, or started judging new seasons by a new/higher standard than before. Because they're all terrible lol, but also, they're terrible in the same way that most horror movies are terrible. It's the kind of thing that you have to judge for what it is, not what you wanted it to be. I find my existence, and my enjoyment of tv &amp; movies, are just way better/easier when I go into horror with zero expectations and enjoy it for what it is instead of trying to find things to hate about it. Because there will always be a lot to hate if you're judging it that way. If you're looking. Watching AHS when I was in like, the worst time of my life, made me fall in love with horror and also taught me that horror doesn't need to be """"""""good"""""""" in the traditional sense to be enjoyable. Actually, the low quality, cheesy, etc-ness of it all is exactly why I love it, lol. Does that make any sense? Probably not. Sorry, lol. ETA: I'm probably just being biased tho. I'm sure it's true that the quality went down over the years. I mean I definitely got more enjoyment from earlier seasons. So maybe this was all pointless nonsense IDK.	unusable

The movie I remember opens with a security guard locking up an office complex at the end of the work day.� He lets a guard dog out into the lobby.� There is a worker in the complex who might have fallen asleep at this desk or something but he wakes up and comes down the elevator to find the place locked up.� The dog comes at him and he flees back to the elevator.� At the same time, there is a guy who had stowed away in the complex to rob it or do some criminal mischief.� Both the worker and the criminal realize they're not alone in the building when they see the elevator lights going through the floors and they play cat and mouse trying to avoid each other.� I forget how it ends. I've searched thru movie databases and haven't found anything close to this. Incidentally, Doberman Patrol has also been released under the title Trapped, from 1973.	unsolved

NameThatMovie	1k6zmij	2_2	Fumanchu369	2025-04-24T22:47:11Z	Hmm, that kinda sounds like it... but I don't recall a woman at all, it was just two men. And this is also a high-rise building from the poster and the office building I remember was only around a dozen floors because a lot of the suspense was watching the elevator light go up and down through the numbers and wondering if it was an empty elevator or the other guy was in it. And the year sounds way off, 1989... I remember the movie in the 70's because I saw it in my parents' house when I was still a teen. Of course, my memory could be faulty. I'm going to have to look for this on Ebay because a search says it's not currently available to buy, rent or view online. Thanks for your help.

NameThatMovie	1k6zmij	3_1_1	MudandWhisky	2025-04-25T00:17:48Z	This is what Gemini said about it: This sounds like a truly obscure made-for-TV movie! The premise is quite specific, and the fact that it's not """"""""Doberman Patrol"""""""" helps narrow it down. Based on your detailed description, the movie that seems to fit best is **""""""""Night Terror"""""""" (1977)**. Here's why it aligns with your memory: * **Made-for-TV Movie, 1970s:** """"""""Night Terror"""""""" was indeed a made-for-television movie that aired in 1977. * **Security Guard Locking Up Office Complex/Guard Dog:** The movie opens with a security guard making his rounds and releasing a Doberman Pinscher into the building after hours. * **Worker Trapped:** A young accountant, played by Richard Romanus, works late and falls asleep at his desk. He wakes up to find the building locked and the guard dog on the loose. He uses the elevator to try and escape. * **Stowaway/Criminal:** There is indeed another character, a burglar (played by Val Avery), who has hidden in the building to rob it. * **Cat and Mouse:** The accountant and the burglar become aware of each other as they try to evade the menacing guard dog within the locked office building, leading to a tense cat-and-mouse game. * **Elevator Lights:** The use of the elevator and the awareness of each other's presence through the moving elevator lights is a key element of the suspense. While the focus is primarily on the accountant trying to survive the night with the dog, the presence of the burglar and their interactions as they try to avoid both the dog and each other fits your recollection of two individuals being trapped. """"""""Night Terror"""""""" isn't a widely remembered film, which would explain why you haven't found many others who recall it. It definitely has that claustrophobic, suspenseful made-for-TV movie vibe of the era. Could """"""""Night Terror"""""""" be the movie you've been searching for all these years?	unsolved			
NameThatMovie	1k6zmij	3_1_1_1	Fumanchu369	2025-04-25T00:36:30Z	This is bizarre. This description sounds exactly like the movie, however there are several videos with """"""""Night Terror"""""""" on IMDB but none are from 1977. Searching online brings up this Night Terror from 1977 (also goes by the title Night Drive) which as you can see from the description is nowhere close to matching the plot above.

When I was young I watched a film that I often think about. I cant remember the title and Ive never been able to find it searching online. It was quite a dark film, I want to guess it was 90s or early 00s. I watched it similar time to watching the piano. The plot I remember is there are two sisters, one disabled. As they grow up the abled sister promised her disabled sister that she would give her everything in life that she gets too. As they get older the abled sister gets a boyfriend and starts spending more time away from her sister which makes her extremely jealous. The disabled sister then reminds the other sister that she promised she could have everything she has, she then ends up having to sleep with the boyfriend. I think in the end the couple run away from the disabled sister? I hope I worded this well, if anyone can help me with a title that would be great. Ive yet to speak to someone who has seen the film before. Thanks

I remember the teacher giving high school students different color armbands to wear. I believe some had brown and others had blue (or maybe it was green and blue). Either way, the kids with one armband color got privileges that kids with the other armband color did not. Without the kids knowing, the teacher was teaching them a lesson about how easy it is still to brainwash and manipulate people into behaving a certain way. Near the end of the film, a couple of the kids try to bust into a secret meeting. As they do, the teacher shows the brainwashed kids images from World War 2 that shows how the kids are acting the same way. The details are all a little fuzzy given that I watched this only one time over 22 years ago.

The characted played by Robert De Niro (or Dustin Hoffman or somebody similar) is virgin man. The character is 35-40 years old, I think.

Then, they have sex (although it wasnt showed probably) and he is glad, because it was his first time. It was typical road movie and Im sure that it was during long travel and rather action movie than comedy. I think that it was typical road movie with a motel scene or something similar. Perhaps it was action movie (or comedy) from 90s or 2000s. Definitely USA. Perhaps its Mandela Effect and it isnt any of these actors, but Im sure mentioned scene.

Hi everyone, I have been trying to find a movie from probably the 90s that I KNOW I watched, but I cannot recall the name. The specific details I remember are that it featured a young teenage girl and a boy she liked, her father was in the military and in one scene, he asked her to pass the chicken breast and she got super embarrassed. Another scene, she got in trouble at school for drawing a naked mermaid, because the boy was going to draw her a picture of a naked man in exchange. I think they burned down a horse barn by smoking cigarettes at one point. Please help me, someone! It was really good and I have been thinking about it on and off now for 30 years.

Theres a woman who is control of her life and seems to have an important career in an important position. Theres a man and i dont remember their relation, but this man acts like a spoiled child thats annoys her as hell, and wants to control her. He does things that complicates things for her ( for example, not that it happened in the movie, dropping plates intentionally on the floor, etc..), like a child not having its will. In the end, she gives up, and let him have his will, seemingly being his servant. In one scene you see her carrying his luggage Maybe the plot is that his father is tired of him being a childish asshole, unable to grow up. The father probably hires her to discipline and educate him, but its an impossible task for her. Tried prompting chatgpt in loads of ways but no luck. Im not sure about any of this, since i remember it very faintly, but the film was unique and very good.	unsolved

I think before this one they also did one where no one was given a mask and they choose all the good options but I could be wrong about that. Either way I really want to find it for something I'm researching, either the video or the episode from the show.	unusable			TV show

Friend started a a movie, but spent several minutes in the dvd menu applying a """"""""hack"""""""" that resulted in a topless woman on the dvd menu screen. By hack, I mean he used some secret sequence of dvd menu clicks which unlocked the topless menu. In my head, the movie was Eurotrip. But when I did a search I found nothing regarding this dvd menu hack. Did I just make up this memory? Or was there another movie that had this?	unusable

The trailer includes a scene of a girl in a classroom talking about a creature or something that stays in the darkest corner of your room. There is then a scene where she is in her room at her desk and she turns and looks at a dark corner. The only other thing I remember is that the girls face is taken off. I want to remember the name because it scared me as a kid. I probably saw this in the early to mid 2010's, but there is a chance that the dvd I was watching was a movie from the 2000's.

This one was on at one time and i dont remember very much of the plot at all but i remember a few scenes. It was live action. First, there was a cat girl who helped the main character escape from prison in some alternate dimension. She kills some mouse prison guards and says something along the lines of """"""""dont forget about me"""""""" with blood dripping from her mouth and he replies """"""""I dont think I ever will be able to"""""""". Secondly, I remember the main character had a body double. Not sure how it worked but while he was in the alternate dimension something else had control of his body or something like that. His body double sang """"""""Brick House"""""""" by the Commodores before proposing to his girlfriend. The girlfriend mentions somethinf about the ring not being his grandmother's ring and the body double is like """"""""oh i threw that old thing away, you dont want that"""""""" Lastly, I remember the body double put a spray in a bunch of children's toys and it got one one guy, who then proceeded to view his clothes as alive. He strips naked and runs across the screen at the end of the movie, urging the audience to take their clothes off too. I honestly do not remember what the movie was abiut but I do remember that the guy needed to get out of the other world and prevent his company from shipping the toys. It was a SUPER weird movie haha. Thanks in advance!

This movie is about a troubled young man, late teens to early 20s. He went to live with relatives to get a new start. He arrives late at night and had little time to catch up. His cousin took him to his living area, a back house that was covered with foliage or something, not easy to locate if you didn't know it was there. Next morning, he woke up to greet his family in the main house but they were all dead, brutally murdered. I think the rest of the movie he is running from the murderers, trying to figure out who they are and what was is their motive. Thanks in advance!

whatsthemoviecalled	1kvg84v	0	handsfeetandnut	2025-05-25T23:35:31Z	Psychological horror movie about a girl trapped in a box I remember a lot about this movie but the information is too similar to true crime cases for me to find anything but 'The Girl in the box' and that is not the correct movie. I rented this movie from Family Video about 8 years ago. This movie stars with a young women attending a sex club and going home and with a husband and wife couple, in movie sequence she wakes up in a hallucination/dream sequence in a house where the walls and such are decrepit like an abandoned house but she's in a massive bed with cleanish furniture and there's another girl with her in the room. This other girl keeps saying that 'daddy' and 'mommy' are outside the room and warning her about them, but she's also taking like they've known each other for a while I think. In the start the other girl says something about a door, and the main character says there isn't a door, and then the other girl says something like yeah there is silly look, and then the camera shows a giant door that just appears out of nowhere to prove the dream/hallucination like quality of the scenes In the very end it turns out the main character was being kept in a box as a like a sex slave or something, and eventually she escapes somehow and the big reveal is that the movie takes place when she's in a coma in the hospital after escaping and I think she either wakes up or dies in the end If there's any questions or anything please comment, thank you for your time =O<�	unsolved

whatsthemoviecalled	1lbzasp	0	Tittypicsforpeace	2025-06-15T12:35:37Z	Killer stabbed with a crystal bird feather (possible giallo) So I was watching The bird with the Crystal Plumage recently and I thought I had seen it before. I could only recall one scene that I remember with almost perfect clarity but as I watched the movie, it became clear that I was confusing it with something else. I have a very clear memory of a movie that ends in a dark room, almost completely black, with a bright red drape or fabric on the floor in which the protagonist and the killer in the movie have a fight. There is a large crystal statue of a bird on a table nearby and the tail feathers can be removed. In the struggle, the protagonist manages to get a hold of one of these feathers and stabs the killer which ends the final confrontation. I suppose that due to the climax of this movie having a literal bird with crystal plumage as a major factor, my mind naturally confused it with the 1970 Dario Argento movie. Did I watch some sort of homage to Bird with the Crystal Plumage or a knockoff movie or something. I feel like I gaslight myself with false memories. Any help would be appreciated!

UPDATE: I have remembered more details so I will add them in here. - If I recall correctly the police office was a woman - I think the person who was possessed was a child - It took her much longer than expected to arrive at the hospital Becasue she was struggling to find her way (kept taking wrong turns or something) so her superiors become suspicious of her not realising there were darker things at play	unusable			TV show
whatisthatmovie	1kp3xog	2	SoftPois0n	2025-05-20T18:16:54Z	**Could you share some more information, so that it would be more accurate to guess like:** * Year of the movie release? like recent or before 2010 or early 2000's * Any cast like actor or actress you remember * is it a English or Non English film? I am thinking: the opening of **Legion** (2010).	unusable			
whatisthatmovie	1kp3xog	2_1	Different-Physics-58	2025-05-20T21:12:49Z	I think its definitely after 2010. Dont remember any of the although I am starting to believe that the police office was female and that I think it was a child who was possessed but I think I could be wrong. I think on her way to the hospital she gets lost ( maybe it was raining??) which is her reason for why she could not get to the hospital in time and I think her superiors doubt how long it should have taken her to get there and suspect that she was involved in harming the child?? Im starting to feel like I have made it up =-=-	unusable

whatisthatmovie	1kp3xog	1	Tonyh1975	2025-05-22T00:14:40Z	I just watched this recently but can't remember the movie. I remember the adult puts the kid in the backseat, and the kid ends up getting horribly beaten by something as the adult is driving the kid somewhere. She eventually stops the car and opens the back door and sees the devastation. The cops think she did it because there is some kind of disparity between the time she left the pickup spot to when she stopped.	unusable

whatisthatmovie	1kp3xog	1_1_1	Tonyh1975	2025-05-22T15:48:12Z	The odd part is, I remember this scene so clearly. I remember the kid/passeneger was being atatcked violently in the back seat. I recall limbs twisting/breaking...horrific scene. I remember the cop stopping and opening the door and seeing the carnage. I remember the scene at the police station or hospital where her fellow cops/superiors are questionsing whther she could have done it with her baton/nightstick. They mentioned something about how long it took her to get to her destination and how she would have had time to do it. But, no one I mention this to remembers this movie at all. It could have been from a TV series or streaming show. I have looked over the entire internet and worded the synopsis of the scene every possible way but keep getting the same two or three movies reccomended which do not fit. Even weirder, I can't recall any other scene from this movie to help the algorithm. I know you didn't implantthis in my head, OP. I know that I saw it, but now I am trappped in this same spot you are. I honestly didn't even think about this movie until you mentiend it and now I am obsessed. LOL	unusable			
whatisthatmovie	1kp3xog	1_1_1_1	Different-Physics-58	2025-05-22T22:22:24Z	Yes that is exactly how I am replaying the scene in my head. I think there she didnt realise how long her journey actually took her or something along those lines. I have been racking my brain for days now trying to figure out what might have lead up to that scene but nothing pops to mind. Ive tried googling it using chat gpt but no avail. Honestly at this point if you hadnt said that you have seen it too I would have just thought I made it up =-	unusable			
whatisthatmovie	1kp3xog	1_1_1_1_1	Tonyh1975	2025-05-22T22:27:11Z	Part of me wonders if it was a story in an anthology type of film. It would account for why we can recall this one scene but nothing that really comes before it or after it. I feel like it has a level of found footage to it because I feel like the part where the cops were discussing her possibly killing the child was from the viewpoint of a security camera in the police station. I know it's real, I am just so confused why there's nothing on the internet about it and no one remembers it. I recall watching it alone, so I can't ask any family or friends.	unusable			
whatisthatmovie	1kp3xog	1_1_1_1_1_1	Different-Physics-58	2025-05-22T22:40:28Z	Me too. Part of me suspects that the police officer first went to see the child at their house to see if they were possessed?? and I think she went with a colleague but maybe Im mixing it up with something else. Does that ring a bell for you??	unusable

Three men go on a wilderness trip, two are brothers (one experienced, the other less so), and the third is a friend. After one brother gets injured and can't move, the friend snaps, kills him with a rock, and then hunts down the other. &gt;!The movie ends with the killer finding the last survivor, killing him, and mounting his head on a wooden stake or trunk!&lt;. No famous actors. Very gritty, realistic tone.

Someone was talking about an older movie, but it wasnt black or white maybe early 2000s. Meaning they gaged anything before 2000s as potentially being in black and white.

The only thing I have to go on is a scene that made him laugh. There's a prisoner in a Western type jail and he's being forced by a deputy out sheriff to sweep the floors. At some point, there's a conversation and the prisoner tells the authority figure he knows someone that could help and offers to go get them. The authority figure agrees to let the guy go and the prisoner hands over the broom and asks if the sheriff/deputy will finish sweeping for him. Sheriff/deputy says yes and as the prisoner leaves, he starts sweeping. A few seconds later he has a """"""""wait, why am I sweeping"""""""" moment and throws the broom down. That's it. That's all I've got. I'm guessing the scene was played for comedic purpose because my dad still giggles when he talks about it. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!	unsolved

She kind of reminded me of Tippi Hendren, and there was a man, but the room was full of dolls..like, porcelain kind of, taking small bites out of her everywhere. I don't remeber how they escaped. I just remeber running to my room and getting rid of dolls. My Aunt thinks it was a twilight zone. I don't THINK it was puppet master.

It starts with a boy whose dad gets taken by aliens that arrive in an intensely bright light, and is taken to some crater that is later revealed to have an alien base underneath it, which can be accessed by some kind of sinking spots like quicksand in it? It always made me think of Pokemon Mystery Dungeons, the desert stage where you fall through the quicksand into a dungeon below. His dad comes back, notably fussing with a weird wound on the nape of his neck and having less ability to emote or show emotion. Later on his mom also gets nabbed, and it goes through the whole sequence of him trying to save them, at the end its shown to be a dream, but then the lights that occur when stealing the parents away happens again at the end. I loved this movie so much but i just cannot find it. Appreciate yall!

So I remember this movie with a kid hiding from the bad guys in his subdivision and makes his way to the model home and uses Kevin-esk booby traps and hides in the attic. I seem to remember a scene with the cabinets being fake they opened the door and it was blank like there was a board blocking the inside of the cabinet.

Its something like Tales of Treasure Island or escpape from.mystery island. anyway moving foward. It starts off with a young teen aged boy, he has a book. He somehow gets pulled into the book and wakes up on an island. Its very pirate themed. With alot of cheesy humour. On the pirates was a tall male (african i think) with a short blade that was think to thick (,interms of blade width) shaped with a curved angle. Main pirate is blackbeard look a like i think. Its really hard to remember for me, but i think the young boy had to find some treasjre which had the key or something to get back to real world. There was a weird cave/tomb tbey went into (big pirates head style tomb) which turned everyone to stone (i could potentially be muddling this part up with another film) I am sure the film ended with the boys nan or soemthing whonwas just reading the story and all was a dream, or was it ? Please i am hoping you beautiful folks have the answer for me!

The premise of it was a bunch of assassins (?) had bombs implanted in them and forced to kill each other I think, with the bombs preventing them from exiting the city. Notable scenes in the movie were a guy chopping off another's fingers using a cigar cutter. And a scene with the lead actress taking off the bomb from her abdomen. There's probably some wrong minor details here but this is all i can remember. I watched this like 17 years ago.

There was a mentally childlike adult man and another kidnapper, I think it was the mother of the man, they locked the girls in the basement, the other girl was hallucinating from trauma, and the other one wanted her to wake up from it, and she did from time to time. I also think there was a scene where the other girl had the kidnapper put make up on her and act as a doll bc if the man found out she was real he would rip the girl apart.

They send out someone and they take off their helmet to breathe in the air, but they die. Someone figures out that there actually is no radiation outside but rather it's the suits or something else that is sabotaged/rigged to kill the person to make the others believe the air is still deadly.

I don't remember the title but know it was an independent film that was shown on either the Sundance Channel or Independent Channel back when they did show independent films. One event that happens in the movie to make the main character become a real-life superhero is that he is with a bunch of friends playing in an abandoned building in a bathroom. One of the boys hits this little boy too hard in the head and the kid starts bleeding and acting funny. He then falls into a stall dead and the boys freak out and leave the body. Eventually the kid's parents report him missing and discover his body later on. There was a local child molester or someone on the rejestry that was blamed for the murder instead.

Ive been struggling to remember the name of the movie, I think starring Cary Grant, where he had a butler with a secret past that he was protecting. The butler was a side character and Im pretty sure most of the movie did not directly deal with him until the end. The secret was that the butler had been accused of murdering his wife the body of whom was never found, found guilty and hanged, believed dead, but survived. He then found the wife alive and well and killed her thinking hed already been hanged for killing her so it was ok. He is then tried again for murdering her and hanged again. And survives again. I think he is found by the lead character who mustve been a doctor. He then goes on to be the lead characters butler for years. It comes to a head when theres some kind of political event or something where somebody discovers the butler has a secret past (but not necessarily what it actually was) and threatens to reveal it causing the lead character to get the Butlers permission to just reveal it. Help. The Google (and my family) has been of no use.

It was a really good film and for 30 odd years I've been wondering what it was called! This is what I can remember: """""""" A group of young people were staying in an old house. I think it was a large, whitish house. One by one, they got killed. """""""" One of the killers was a slim, old man with grey hair wearing denim dungarees, weilding an axe or sythe. I can picture him so easily in my minds eye now. """""""" I think there was a camper trailer and one of the women (who got killed) ran into the camper trailer. She had long dark hair. In the camper trailer, she turned the taps and she screamed as blood came out the taps. """""""" I vaguely recall someone else (I think a young man) was killed by falling through the old rickety wooden floors of the house. He fell through multiple floors then landed and drowned in a thick, white slimy substance in the cellar. I remember my friend saying she think's the film may have been called """"""""Ghost House"""""""", but I've googled """"""""Ghost House"""""""" and nothing matches. It was a great film and we all enjoyed it. I'd love to know what it was called and perhaps watch it again!

I also remember her brother getting knocked down by a car and one of her parents ending up in a wheelchair because she refused to be possessed.

NameThatMovie	1kevzmk	0	BTFlik	2025-05-04T22:15:57Z	80s? Horror Movie. So the movie is about a family, mother, father, older brother, middle sister, young boy, who move into a house. But the oldest brother starts getting strange from an implied possession and he stays away from. The family and staying in his attic room. Eventually the movie """"""""implies"""""""" that he seduces his younger sister and then ultimately kills his entire family. Possibly relayed, I think it might start with an old person dying in the house and cutting themselves on a strange lamp EDIT: Solved! THANK YOU! I saw these movies LONG ago, like back in elementary school. I thought they were a fever dream and it's because I was mixing scenes from both movies together! Thank you everyone!				mixes up two movies

I also remember two scenes, one where the serial killer breaks into an apartment where he kills an overweight woman while she was watching TV and the other where he kills a man outside what I think was a cabin, he then breaks into the cabin and kills the mans girlfriend.	unsolved

My memory is vague so some things may be off: An ordinary man and an alien are having a discussion in a room, sitting down at a conference table. The alien is almost completely hidden in the dark, with maybe only his eyes being visible and maybe a vague outline shape of his head. The human is in the light and can be seen. Both seem calm and the human is interviewing the alien or at least just asking questions. I believe the questions are around alien technology, how is the alien able to understand him and communicate and possibly even philosophical questions like the meaning of the universe and life. The alien tries to answer all the questions, but I think for some, he says he cant because the human wouldnt be able to comprehend. I think the clip I saw even has the alien saying something like youre asking another question that I cant answer as if maybe they already had discussed certain questions cant be answered or at least that he may not be able to answer every question. Ive looked everywhere for this and starting to believe that it may not be a full length feature film and must either be a short film or something. Does this sound familiar to anyone? (Just as a heads up, Ive been suggested that it may be Arrival (2016) and can confirm that is not the film).	unusable

whatmoviewasthat	1lg2xo8	0	Toothless-mom	2025-06-20T12:38:00Z	Sci-Fi film Putting a spoiler flair bc I am going to spoil the end of this movie in efforts to find it. This movie is a sci fi film about a guy up in space by himself. He goes crazy, at the end he calls someone (I believe his wife?) and hes told that it was all an experiment and he was never even in space in the first place, and if he opens the door to the pressure chamber he can just leave. But then it turns into this whole thing because you dont know for sure if that phone call is also part of his delusions so at this point you really dont know if he was ever in space or if he was, if he still is currently. I know the end is him ultimately deciding to leave the space craft and I remember when he does its like, everything is crashing. Things are falling from the air and after he emerges from the space craft he has to go through this like obstacle course that looks like an underground building. I know he reaches light at the end I believe that the end is left up for interpretation bc I dont remember if I personally thought he was ever in space or not At first I was almost positive it was the movie Moon but it isnt. I rewatched moon last night and although the stories are insanely similar, it isnt the movie I watched. Coming back to edit because I remember another detail, I swear, Samuel L Jackson appears at some point and tries to kill our main guy? No idea why, but I remember it happening. I went and looked at Jacksons filmography and couldnt figure it out still. And thats all I got. Does anyone know what movie this is?

whatsthemoviecalled	1kdb5u0	0	lvr-80	2025-05-02T20:36:02Z	Zombie movie from the 2000s It's basically a zombie movie in which there's a group of teenagers and in one scene around half of the movie, they are in some HS facilities, walking through an aisle I think. I'm pretty sure that also a football field is shown after that. They are obviously scaping from the zombies. Last but not least, I'm also somewhat certain that the movie starts with a dead girl laying on a hospital table naked but with a blanket on, with a forensic doctor doing his work. If I'm not wrong, he then turns around and that's when she wakes up as a zombie and kills him. Although I think it's all from the same movie, I might be confusing this scene with some other film. Considering the filming quality and the special effects I remember, I can only guess it's from the early 2000s, but I could be wrong. I know I'm not helping a lot with the information given, but the truth is that I have very few recollections from it. I didn't own it, only rented, and I watched it only once or twice when I was a kid. Hope you can help me find it, but thanks if you try anyway =L<�	unsolved

When I was a kid in the late 70s/early 80s, a trailer for a horror movie freaked me out. A person was cautiously approaching a closed shower curtain.

A half remembered scene from a trailer 45-ish years ago. If it helps, Im sure this was the ad for tv, not a theater add. To this day, I still get just a tad twitchy when a shower curtain is closed.

He promotes his son The dude's best friend is jealous. They all have swords, I believe with sashes on them He has a girl, but they all have to go off to war. And it's like in the desert, he gets captured in some sort of prison, where they all have to walk around in a circle. He does escape , but his best friend went back home and told the dude's girlfriend that he was dead. By the time he gets back home, he finds out. His girlfriend married his best friend. She meets him at like. I think at a church in a horse drawn carriage. I believe it's a movie like Kingdom of heaven. Except their weapons.I believe were like muskets.

I tried my best to remember the name of a movie I watched a while ago... And I need your help. lol. I watched it at least 10 years ago. It's a very dark story. It's basically the story of a little girl (who's around 7, 8yo? can't remember) and her dad, a hard rock musician in the United States. Her dad, who's having drug issues, is going through some trouble and decides to escape with her and find shelter in a house in the countryside. So the 2 characters are going in the house, and shortly after that, the dad dies on the sofa (probably an overdose). The rest of the movie is about his daughter trying to survive alone in the house, until she finds someone. If I remember correctly, the people she find aren't really friendly (a mother and her son with heavy mental health issues). Any help would be appreciated ! :)

During these flashbacks, he tells about a friend of his, with some intellectual disabilities (for some reason in my mind the actor is Robin Williams, but I can't be sure). 2.1. They were delivery boys that ran errands with a bicycle and I remember that in one of those deliveries a woman was lying in a bed a showed her p*** as a 'tip' for their delivery. 2.2. For some reason, they got into an argument or fight and stopped talking to each other. But as the movies goes on, in the present time the woman he's talking to incentives their meeting. 3. During the flashbacks, there is a locked up black woman that talks to his reflection through a shattered mirror glass while he's at the street and talks looking to her cell windows. 3.1. She gives him some love advice, and how to invite the girl he likes to the prom, and also how to dance with her. 3.1.1 During the prom the only thing I remember was that he was wearing a really really orange suit, like, really orange. 3.2. For some reason the woman and kid got into a discussion and she lies to him telling she in jail for murder. Only to know at their present time she was locked up for some misdemeanor. 4. At close to the end, the movie goes to present time and he meets his old friend and they both ride a bike, with the girl he was talking to during the whole movie. These are the things I remember guys, I really wanna remember this movie name

THANK YOU ALL THAT HELPED I have remembered this movie for years but havent had the opportunity to watch it. All I can remember is basic stuff, like the tagline. This is probably most important. Its something like this. Hes got her kids. Shes got his. But wheres the kids of her? ITS SOMETHING LIKE THAT, as far as Im aware. Basic like idea of the movie is that there are three people, each with their own kids; two women, one man. One of these pairs of kids ends up missing in the transaction of people, kind of. The movie is a light hearted family comedy, and from the looks of the people in the movie poster (judging by their hair), the movie appears to have come out in the 80s.

whatisthatmovie	1kbbac0	0	onlypuppet8	2025-04-30T08:13:53Z	I watched it ~17yrs ago [FOUND] This has been haunting me for months. I have no idea what the plot was but it had such a vibe that my preteen self emulated it in with barbie heads. I think it was a new release at the rental store, so probably came out around 2007. Its an indie film, low budget. The setting is the middle of nowhere desert in a rickety old house. There are two main characters, a father and young daughter. There might be a grandma, not sure. The father is losing his mind over something I think and might have a shotgun at some point. The daughter has funky barbie heads for friends and talks to them. They may talk back. Theres a heavy orange filter over most of the movie, if not all. There might be fishbowl effects used, but if not there was some experimental filming styles for sure. Did anyone else watch this? Does anyone remember the name?

I'm going crazy trying to find evidence of this movie ever existing. What I remember is this: this guy (the protag I assume) is on a commercial flight when suddenly some sort of supernatural light flashes and makes everyone onboard, including the pilots, completely blind. Everyone except this one guy, due to him sleeping and having a sleeping mask on or something. The plane is on course to crash due to this, so the guy steals over a dozen of the blind passengers inflatable life jackets and stuffs himself inside them greedily just to save himself. I believe in the end the plane crashes and everyone dies except him, due to him stealing all those life jackets for his own benefit. Any ideas? Google and AIs have been no help and I'm losing my mind, thanks!	unusable			TV show

He wakes to find everyone else has been blinded by the stellar phenomena so he grabs everyone's life jacket and makes himself a nest of them in the toilet so as to survive the crash.

I'm pretty sure it was an action/adventure movie and I'm positive it was pre-2000 cause I remember my mom laughing at that scene. I vaguely remember he mightve taken a watch off too. Ok now that I've slept on it I remember more. *a guy walks into a room like he doesn't want anyone seeing him. Brown hair. Wearing a suit. Walks to fish tank and takes off his jacket, removes watch and rolls up the sleeve on his right arm then puts his left arm into the tank. There is no interaction with the fish in anyway. Most likely 90s movie or early early 2000s. So range from 1990-2005. It is not: * Naked gun *Fish called wanda *Harry crumb *Deuce Bigelow * Loaded Weapon * Million dollar mystery *Batman returns (although the scene is similar and triggered the memory) And still checking the other ones mentioned.	unsolved

It would have been released in the 1940s-1950s, probably. I dont think the main characters was a tough-detective type like in a lot of noir movies: he really got pushed around by this woman. A lot of femmes fatales are depicted as having an elegant, victimized persona and use that to their advantage, but this one was a total bully, coarse-talking I think, and wanted to look tough. To be honest Ive never seen the movie so I dont have any other details; I just remember a description I read of this womanI think she was lower-class economically, blond maybe, and described as really gritty and tough-talking. Thanks for any suggestions!

There's a triage nurse who calls them through one by one but they never come back, eventually the remaining friends get angry and go to find them themselves. It would be 2005-2015 ish I reckon.

There's a scene at a big party or festival where they sold their friend's ashes disguised as cocaine to earn money for the road. They also visited Romania, Paris, and Amsterdam, if I'm not mistaken.

From the little bit I remember a mother and her new husband end up getting back the mothers son from a previous relationship. I believe the boys father had kidnapped him. At one point in the beginning the little boy ends up getting in the babys crib and the mom was freaking out until she found him in there. That is literally all I can remember.

Theres a scene by a pool involving the vampire and the guy. I just remember them talking The human girl kills the vampire in the end, in a fight on a bed The fight involves floating or flyingthe vampire levitates during the fight The vampire may have worn a necklace (possibly a cross) that gave her this power At some point during the struggle, the human girl removes the necklace, causing the vampire to lose her power and fall This gives the girl a chance to stab the vampire, possibly with a knife or similar object After the vampire dies, the human girl takes her necklace/power (I think) and gains the ability to levitate as well I also remember that the mom of the vampire saw her daughter dead on her bed after this all happened, and came crying.

I remember the girl wasn't very old, I think she had blonde hair and wore it in a ponytail for this scene and it took place on a race track (for runners not cars). She started the race running at her normal pace, but the others were playing dirty. She got tripped up by the other competitors and fell behind in the race. I remember she was bent down like she was tying her shoe laces and said a spell of some kind and her shoes had a life of their own. She started to zoom around the track like a roadrunner. This may be from another film but I remember a scene where they're at the prom and the mean girl comes up to her and is throwing insults. But she turns her into a dog, I think it was a white poodle or something similar. This may not be the same film but I know they both involved a witch/magic.

The one scene I remember was rather disturbing: - a beautiful naked lady is standing naked in her opulent bedroom, using lotion; - a darkhaired man watches her through the door of the room (maybe keyhole); - all of a sudden he storms in and rapes her; - right afterwards and still lying on her he feels guilty and starts crying; - she looks motionless. The whole movie propably was a thriller, but this is the one scene haunting me. I want to get it out of my help by watching the whole movie and putting it into context!

The plot was that there was a grown man, who was intellectually the age of a baby. There was a mom in the movie and an adult sister. I believe they called the man, """"""""baby"""""""". Anyhow, a young social worker begins making calls to the home, who is very intrigued by """"""""baby"""""""". The mom shows her away repeatedly, but relents once and let's the social worker watch him. When the mom and sister come home, they find the social worker trying to breast feed him. Someone ends up killed that night but idk which of the three adults it was. I've been trying to figure this out for years.

Hoping someone can help me nail down this one particular slasher/horror film. Like the title mentions, from the best of my recollections, I believe there are four friends who pick up a hitchhiker who seems suspicious. Their car breaks down or one of them, a girl, leaves and the others follow after her. They find a house with a barn and there's also a car that appears burned. A storm is starting so they first head into the barn but then see about getting into the house. There they start a fireplace and sleep. My memory gets especially hazy here. But I recollect a scene of someone drinking wine, falling asleep on a bed. A room of many picture frames of a woman, and a couple who turn up towards the end. Any help would be appreciated, bless!

The only element I remember clearly is a duo, male and female, who seem to be tasked with ensuring the film progresses properly. They have conversations about their satisfaction/ or lack thereof in their life. At one point, the male character decides he wants to be the killer himself, and dresses like an electrician to ambush some girls having a get-together at home after the lights go out. Any help would be appreciated.

Basically, a bunch of people are stuck in a house (willingly I believe) in a competition for a million dollars. To win they have to be the last one in the house. Food and drink is provided for them through an elevator thing. As time goes on, someone dies (I think they got shot?) and everyone freaks out and some want to leave but they realize they can't escape. Then the food and drink provisions are being reduced so they're fighting for survival. Eventually, one person is the last survivor and a million dollars is given to her through the elevator shoot in a large duffel bag. She stands at the door and waits for it to open. When it opens, it's revealed that it is not an exit. Instead, it's a group of dead/dying people clutching their duffel bag with a million dollars in it.

whatmoviewasthat	1kfdwji	0	LoveYourselfAsYouAre	2025-05-05T15:06:24Z	I think it was a horror or mystery type movie We follow our main protagonist who is a teenage boy and I think hes visiting his dad for the summer. He noticed that his neighbor son goes missing and nobody seems to remember that the son ever existed. He makes friends with this girl who is also a teenager, but I think that happens later on in the movie. He discovered that there is some creature who is stealing kids and removing everybodys memory of them, and the big twist in the end is that he also had a little brother who came with him to visit his dad who he forgot about. In the end, he gets his brother back and all three of them are driving back home. But thats when he realizes the flower the girl gave him is not real, and they had discovered that the creature that was stealing kids killed all the real flowers and vegetation around it. Then we cut to the same girl, in a boat with a bunch of kids as the teenage boy realize that she was the monster all along. I think it was made relatively recently, like probably within the past 10 to 15 years. I dont remember anything else about it besides that, any other clues would be very helpful, thanks!	unsolved

It looked like was set in late 19th-early 20th century (clothes, hairstyles). Now the only two memorable details I remember are: 1. Two main male characters, one with a beard and one with a moustache, were fichting naked in a room with the fireplace (it was definitely fighting unless I've repressed something=) 2. Character with a moustache goes out and freezes to death in the snow. And that's the ending as far as I remember. I hope someone else knows this movie because I feel like I dreamt it or accidentally watched some old p*rn 15 years ago and imagined the plot.

I'm looking for the name of a particular movie, which I have definitely watched, but now I can't find it anywhere. I've done a lot of google searching and asking chatGPT, (both of which act like the movie doesn't exist), and haven't been able to come up with anything. It seems really weird because it wasn't like some totally obscure, micro-budget, bad indie movie, that no-one has heard of. It was a low/mid-budget, full length, normal, high quality, feature film, which i think was originally released on, or produced by either netflix or amazon prime. The movie is about a depressed, neurodivergent, socially withdrawn/socially awkward trash collector. Usually, every morning, a friendly child waves at him from their front yard, during his garbage collection route. But one day, the child isn't there. The man begins to realize something might have happened to the child, and (rather ineptly) begins trying to investigate what might have happened to the child. The trashman notices odd changes in the familys trash and neighborhood behavior. Using his own unique way of thinking and observing details others often overlook, he starts piecing together what may have happened to the boy.

whatisthatmovie	1knj021	0	fireflower413	2025-05-15T20:49:47Z	Looking for an animated movie with wizards that I saw when I was a kid All I know about this movie is that two wizards have an argument and one wizard says to another that something is """"""""inevitable"""""""". I know this because that's how I learned the word """"""""inevitable"""""""" as a kid. The movie was definitely animated and I have the impression that the wizards were wearing robes and had beards (shocker) but no idea anything else about the story. I thought for years that this would probably be a Lord of the Rings adaptation, with Saruman telling that to Gandalf, but I've since watched every animated adaptation of The Lord of the Rings looking for it, and it wasn't any of them. Also, my very vague memory thinks that there was at least one dragon involved in the movie, and LotR doesn't have that. If it helps, I was growing up in the 90s. I got amnesia after that and this is one of the only things from before then I can remember. Please help me find this scrap of childhood if you can! Thank you!	unsolved

SOLVED The movie is called """"""""DRIVING ME CRAZY"""""""" It came out in 1991. Thanks. I don't remember the title, but it left me thinking about it all these years. From what I remember, a guy invents a car, and people are after it, obviously, to make money off of it. I don't remember much of the movie, but what I do remember is that the inventor destroys the car to prevent it from going into the wrong hands. He did this because he is the only one that can rebuild another one. That's all I remember from it. I don't know the release date cause it was shown on TV in a hotel/motel type place in the late 80s or early 90s. Thanks for your help. This movie has been bugging me for decades. Edit to add: the inventor is from Europe, I remember he had an accent. And the car runs on i believe vegetables.	solved / confirmed	Driving Me Crazy (1991)	tt0104142

In color, not black-and-white The plot. A family or someone (girl) moves into an old house. -Or it could be someone is admitted into a hospital or even a mental hospital for an extended period of time, but the building is a large old house. But there are a few people she discusses the events with - so not sure if its her family or other inmates. Soon after the female lead discovers there are beings (like shadows or dark beings?) that come out at night. They live in the walls? In Other rooms? Or parts of the house that have been sealed off? Not sure exactly tbh As usual, no one believes her but one night she discovers or is brought to an old woman that sits in the top attic room of the building. The room is dusty, dirty and dark. The old woman sits on a chair, staring out of the front top window of the house. They discussed something, details of the plot, or what is happening, how the old lady got there (? No idea) etc., and the female lead, either escapes or is let free and returns to the main part of the house. Some type of event occurs where it is believed that the shadow beings are removed and everything returns back to normal but at the last scene, the young girl is now sitting in the chair in the top attic room staring out the front window. * it was not Dont Be Afraid of the Dark& Just watched that and its definitely not it&.

There are 2 parts I remember; 1) The beginning of the film starts with a story about a native american man playing a magic drum. He disappears, and a raven or crow comes in and starts pecking at the drum, destroying it. A wolf then enters and stops the raven. 2) Later on in the same film, a kid is fighting against some sort of shape-shifting evil, and uses the drum and \[I think\] a necklace to ward it off? Additional Note: For some reason, I also have some memories of a glass harmonica in the film, but not a typical glass harmonica, more like multiple glasses filled with water to create the sound. I worry that I'm misremembering, or confusing the glass harmonica part with a different film like Shapeshifter.	unsolved

I have very few details that I remember about it unfortunately. I believe it was about a brother and sister on some adventure in a mystical place. There was a scene where they were trying to get up (or maybe down) a cliff and they covered a rock in magic goo, affixed a rope onto it, and then threw it up (or maybe down) the cliff. They then shimmied on the rope to continue on their way. Thats all I got. Please help! Edit: [The Argon Quest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgfO33RffXc) (1992) <� The scene Im referencing is at 35:00.

But the children think the maid is a bad person and often make prank on her. She says that only when you need me then I will go away. The ending plot is that the maid does something really good and memorable to the children, and she must leave.

One scene is burned into my brain Mildly NSFW I recall this movie from seeing it on late night cable. More likely HBO than skinemax. It wasn't really soft core porn. I would have seen it probably between 91-93. It was almost definitely straight to video/cable and low budget. Anyway, there is one scene I remember vividly, that kind of haunted me. The movie was darkly futuristic and the scene I remember involved the main character and his friend, who was possibly developmentally disabled, or at least """"""""a little slow""""""""/""""""""not all there"""""""", looking through a landfill to find something the MC lost. Pretty sure both characters were white, and I feel like the friend was noticably dirty and maybe wearing overalls. He was definitely skinny. At one point his friend finds a nude, dead woman. He looks over the body curiously, while the camera occasionally cuts back to the MC still searching, then the friend quickly licks her breasts before covering her body with some large trash, seemingly hiding her to """"""""save for later"""""""". I'm sorry I don't have anything more to go on, but the memory of this has been haunting me for over 30 years and I'm hoping someone can help me here.				TW: sexual assault

I remember as a young child (I grew up in the very early 2000s if that helps) and seeing this movie on TV with an actor who I thought was Leslie Neilson but I keep looking up his movies and can't find it. It was really weird to me as a child which is why I still remember it lol but it was about this dentist guy and this girl who's like two faced I guess and she frames him for murder by creating a cast of his teeth and biting the victim she created? And he eventually finds out he's being framed and he also finds the dentures in a teddy bear? And then rips his own teeth out with pliers???? Like I said I just have flashes of memories from watching as a child but I'd really like to know what this movie was lol

There were only two main characters, a man and a woman, maybe blonde, who wake up from cryosleep to find the previous shift gone missing. They get infected with something that makes them angry and violent and maybe changes their blood color? There may have been a recovered earth satellite that the infection was on, and at the end of the movie they somehow save the rest of the sleeping crew by coordinating with another ship before sacrificing themselves to stop the spread. That's all I can remember clearly about this movie. Thanks in advance. EDIT: There is a possibility the title had the word Alien, but I don't know if i can trust my memory on the title, as I only ever caught it on tv.

NameThatMovie	1kiny44	0	moby8403	2025-05-09T17:17:30Z	Long Shot When I was kid (late 80s, early 90s) I saw part of a movie. It gives me the vibe of a made for tv movie (was that a thing back then?) or maybe it was an episode of a show, but I doubt that. It was a thriller/horror, and for SOME reason, I envision Carol Burnett playing this Whatever happened to Baby Jane vibe character. (i think) I was literally maybe 6yo when I saw it on tv. I don't think it's Carol Burnett, I've checked her imdb, but may have over looked this role. But it's a female, dressed sort of clownish, with bright orange curly hair in pigtails, and clownish makeup, and in this scene, I believe she's coming down the hallway, toward the camera, toward some stairs, and I think she was in someone's house. And she's, like, threatening, she's obviously off her rocker. This particular scene scared me, and just fed into my already existing fear of clowns. So it's always stayed in my memory, but I can't figure out what it was.

NameThatMovie	1laqtsc	0	onglogman	2025-06-13T20:53:41Z	Action movie with time traveling/manipulating Edit: gonna put this list here coz there are some crazy suggestions being thrown at me. Films that it is NOT: ARQ, in time, about time, predestination, bttf, anon, 7 splinters in time, looper, FAQ about time travel, primer, equals, tenet, source code. I saw a movie on Netflix, made after 2010. A man (somebody like Clive Owen) gets involved in some bad dealings and there's a bit of a time traveling thing going on. He tries to make a deal with some other men under a large skyscraper, very brutalist style, concrete and grey. At one point he meets a woman in a cafe and goes back to her apartment but he leaves after a bit. There's a knock at the door and it's the same man again but he's out of breath and the woman is surprised and exclaims that he """"""""was quick to come back"""""""" but it turns out that it was himself but the future version. At a later part of the film it shows the """"""""future"""""""" guy going to the apartment after being in a fight (or something) which explains why he was out of breath. EDIT:this scene plays out as the protag is in the apartment and the woman answers the door but won't let the guest in, from our perspective we think that the visitor at the door would be the woman's ex, but the same scene in the future we see that it's the guy who wants to get in. At the end of the film he's sat in a caf� next to a window explaining his situation to the woman and how he """"""""has time now"""""""".	unsolved

There was this red haired, I think female, robot like figure sitting on the bed. Before you say the exorcist, hear me out. She's sitting on the bed but she's kind of facing the door, her back is to the camera. This other woman, human, I guess comes into the room where this thing is and she's promptly unalived. Think she's shoved into a dresser and she hits her head? Then the figure is shown back sitting on the bed and her head makes a robotic like sound when she turns to look back at the blonde haired lady on the ground. Creepiest thing ever and I've never seen it anywhere again. I've never seen the exorcist so if it is it then y'all I'm sorry. Update: I made chatgpt search this particular scene and the only thing that came close in aesthetics is Mirror, Mirror (1990). That's not it though, I looked. Not sure what obscure movie this was but the fact that I can't find it makes it even creepier.	unsolved

So this was around 2015, and I was watching this movie in my brother's laptop. I dont what it's called. But the movie is not exactly a horror, let alone Paranormal. There are intense supernatural or chilling moments. The movie is actually a Comedy/Slice of Life/Drama type of movie. It's about this guy, I think he works at corporate or something. And he is haunted by the guy who's wearing a suit. Again, there are no supernatural elements of scary moments, just a normal guy in a suit. The guys wants nothing to do with the ghost, he finds the situation annoying and tries to ignore it. The ghost I guess, has unfinished business. There is this one scene in the movie where the guy tries to run away from the ghost in broad daylight. And you get this really funny scene where this guy is being chased by a man in a suit. He eventually stops and both kinda seem tired. I forgot the name of the movie, because the didn't even check the name, I just clicked on the movie file an watched it. I'd appreciate the assist, thanks=O<�=O<�=O<�=O<�	unsolved

whatsthemoviecalled	1lbtbg1	3_2	Puzzleheaded-Okra-38	2025-06-15T10:07:23Z	Update, okay so I'm sure it's not the one. From what I can remember, the movie doesn't have much of a cinematic feel and background soundtracks as that one. It was more realistic-like. The chase scene in specific didn't have any dramatic music, it was a mixture of a few shots from far away such that you could see both characters chasing each other. It didn't feel or look supernatural, it just looked like two normal dudes chasing each other. I think that also the haunted guy was on the younger adult side, and the ghost haunting him look kinda middle-aged.	unsolved

I think it was a zombie movie where a group of people were running from zombies. The only detail i remember was at one point one of the characters were captured/eaten and only thing remaining of them was the head wth the spine still attached. The head might have later been reunited with the team and carried with a wheelchair, and/or inside someones backpack. I vaguely remember one of the characters having an axe. It might be an evil dead movie, or similar style.

Country of origin: Unknown, it was dubbed, mostly Caucasian actors. --------------------- At the beginning, various accidents make the life of the priest difficult and eventually a group of ragged-looking humanoids besiege the house the priest lives in. The audience is lead to believe that these beings are demons but in fact they are angels, trying to destroy the nascent Antichrist. They manage to get to him and they try to crucify him (not sure) but the writer-brother intervenes and saves the priest. Later the priest - having woken up to his own real identity - murders his writer-borther (with a dagger?), takes his unfinished manuscript (diary?), finishes it and declares it as the sacred text of a new religion. The last shots show the priest (now as the Antichrist) ushering people inside a temple as he's about the give a sermon from the book of his late brother. --------------------- Some tidbits: The number 11 might have been significant. Maybe there was a time-limit on stopping the coming of the Antichrist (11 PM?). Maybe there is a scene set in a cemetary where the father of the two brothers, tells the writer-brother to protect the priest at all costs. --------------------- It's not: Black Circle Boys (1997) Dark House (2014) Lost Souls (2000) Megiddo: The Omega Code 2 (2001) Midnight Mass (2021) Shelter (2010) --------------------- https://www.gyakorikerdesek.hu/szorakozas__filmek-sorozatok__13033740-egy-film-cimet-keresek-roviden-egy-paprol-szol-es-egy-iro-testverrol-aki-proba

Ive had this movie in my memory forever but I never knew the name of it and no one else Ive asked remembers it. The story is very vague for me because I dont remember that much I just remember there was a nasty ass plot twist in the end. So heres the story kind of: theres been a murder at like this British posh upper class school and a boy is under heavy suspicion. A woman cop is interviewing him and investigating but he manages to tell her such a convincing story about a secret dark brotherhood with religious people killing their girlfriends and taking their bones in a suitcase or something. And hes so good looking and charismatic he manages to convince the woman his friend is part of this and is the murderer. Theres also a thing that the brotherhood uses playing cards for something so after shes let him go she finds a playing card and realizes it was him all along but hes already well on his way. I also remember there was something about incest? And someone killed their own parents and buried them under the house or something and there was a scene with possibly a murder in a greenhouse at the school. And I also vaguely remember a scene between the main character and his friend pointing guns at eachother under a bridge in the rain. Maybe Im mixing movies together I dont know but I need to find out its been bugging me for years. I THINK the movie was called something with mind�maybe idk. � And it may have been released around the 2000s or 2010s I think. please help me!

The military is moved there and bring lots of scientists. On the other side of the portal that is a farm and a family living there, like in the 1800s: The old grandpa, the mother, the father, the beautiful young adult daughter, maybe a young son and a dog. The military discovered that the portal briefly opens at certain time of the day (If a remember a bird from the farm cross the portal giving them the hint). So they put a baseball toss machine shooting the portal constantly, with soldiers refilling the machine. One of the scientists during the investigation fall in love with the young blond daughter from the other side and seems that she also fall for him. After some days, the scientist know the exactly time to cross the portal and he runs for it. Only to discover that the family are some type of vampires/ghoul/monster that gangs him up to eat him. The episode finish with the Old Grandpa in the farm opening a book and casting a """"""""Close Porta"""""""" spell.

If I remember right this family is kidnapped and right when the mother goes to grab the gun or does grab the gun the antagonist rewinds the movie in the movie. I think he also spoke to the camera like we were there or he knew we were watching. Im pretty sure the message was about how we could save them at any point by just turning off the movie but we are too curious and it leads to a bad ending.	unusable			not sure if 1997 or 2007 version

It was showing space and the narrator was a woman talking about some humans having evolved and moved into deep space and the were almost like gods. Other humans advanced with technology and went to space but not as far. And then there were regular humans who's numbers had dwindled. And she spoke about the god like humans coming back and something about an impending war between the god like humans and the tech humans. that's all I got to see and was hoping to see more but could not find it again. Any ideas of what that one might be called? Ty	unsolved

whatmoviewasthat	1lbv88l	1_1	Lepidopterological	2025-06-16T02:58:46Z	Thank you! I had seen that one, when I was looking for the one I remember. It's not the same voice or look of space that I remember. Also, the story was very specifically about one god like race, one tech race and regular humans. The war was between the god likes and the techs. I watched it even though it was not as intriguing an opener to me as the one I recall, but it was still close in terms of having a woman narrator talk about epocs. The one I saw didn't have earth destroyed as part of the narration at the beginning not did it seem to be about the mother of the narrator. Also, even though I did enjoy some aspects I did not like that ending at all. Lol. I did like what she says about the kid being like his father and her wishing that he would be. Thank you again.	unsolved			
whatsthemoviecalled	1lgbcvs	0	delcielo2002	2025-06-20T18:30:13Z	Cold War Family Drama This movie would have been made in the 80s, I think; early 90s at the latest. It takes place in Nevada, I think perhaps Reno, a plot element is the father's obsession with nuclear tests, and an upcoming test will be visible from town. The family consists of two kids, their parents, and a disruptive aunt who comes to live with them. The father has ptsd from the war, drinks, and is volatile. The elder daughter is the main character, and gravitates to the aunt as she comes of age. I want to say her name is Rose. It's mostly a family drama centered around those aspects: the daughter's growth and struggle with their family situation. Saw it years ago and can't seem to find it now. Any ideas? Thanks in advance.

I remember watching a horror movie when I was a kid, and I believe it was released sometime between the 1980s and 2010. There were scenes where the characters had to cross a thin wooden pathif they fell, they would land on a bunch of saw blades. There were also traps, like sharp metal spikes coming out of the walls. I recall two villains: one was a bald man with an axe, and the other (as far as I remember) was a woman with a masculine build who used a bow and arrows to kill people. This movie is like Saw where the characters has to find their way out by escaping bunch and bunch of trap. Finding this movie would really mean a lot to me, as I want to watch it again. I remember being completely hooked the first time I saw it.	unsolved

Later, the Black woman is shown being greeted in an office by an older white man named Bob, who welcomes her to her new job as head of marketing (I think that's the job title).

I watched it's trailer many years ago so I don't have much to go on. What I can recall is the main character sort of slept for many years then woke up in the future. Mc is a white blonde male with shoulder length hair. The villain is looking for an item, he actually says in while torturing some guys 'The Item, where is it?'. There was a scene where the villain used a cross bow on a girl, I think the girl shielded the Mc. There's also a girl, she punched the Mc the first time they met. I think she's the one that woke the Mc up. The also seem to fall in love. I think it was a sequel or so, I also think the title has 'Dragon' in it but I could be wrong. The trailer was part of Jackie chan's ThunderBolt movie at the time (vcd), so I'm guessing it might've come around that year. Please help =G<� B	unsolved

I think it was the summer of 1987 on summer vacation when late at night I came across a movie about a group of home invaders who make their way into a house with a teenage girl home alone and hold her hostage as they rob the place. The girl's boyfriend comes over because they had a date and the girl answers the door and tries to get rid of him, so he doesn't get taken hostage too by saying she's feeling sick, and the date is off. This all I remember of the plot. I should mention that I don't think anyone famous was in it and one of the home invaders was female. It's been 38 years, and I haven't found **anything** on this movie. Can you help?

Had nightmares for weeks! So older than 1976. I have just fractions of memories but it was in a big house and someone sleepwalked and saw a murder or murders. I think there was hidden doors involved. Male protagonist who wasn't sure if he actually had seen something or was just dreaming. Does this ring any bell for someone? I really would like to see it again to find out what was so scary. Bear in mind I was only six so maybe it isn't a horror movie or even a thriller. Just to me! =	unusable			TV show

From memory there were approximately 5 different storylines which all seem to crossover, as in, one story ends and another begins and they seem to go round in a circle. In each story there's these weird winged entities which float around. One story has someone driving a friend to a hospital, only to find it's abandoned and he came get out. Another story has a couple of people in a car travelling through a desert landscape, and another story has a girl trying to escape from a house.

In the year 2000 my mother made me watch a movie with her, I still remember clearly some scenes, but nothing else.. The whole plot was around a ghost mother (or maybe she was alive?) throwing her son off a cliff in the sea, or maybe she jumped in with her son.. This event happened every year, periodically, on the same day, and I remember there was someone that was watching this happen. I also remember a scene where someone wakes up staring at the ceiling, in a room full of candles, and there was someone watching him/her right above his/her face. I'm sure though, the movie revolved around the ghost jumping in the sea with her son/throwing him in, every year on the same day. I'm sure I've seen the movie not after the year 2000, so it's gotta be a movie older than that. Help me please, it's been bugging me for years :)

Recently I decided I want to find it online but I dont have the name and only small portion of the plot. I think I can recognize it if I had a picture of the main character (the husband). Its a similar plot to Law Abiding Citizen. It was a lesser known movie. I believe it was something like, the husband works some desk job, him and his wife live in the suburbs. Heres when it gets foggy for me but there are few ways it went. He was staying late at work and was on the phone with his wife, he later comes home at night, and finds his wife dead. Another possible option: he was on the phone and she was getting kidnapped. Hes just a regular joe but goes to find the guy responsible for her murder/kidnapping and tortures him I believe in his house basement. I recall he tied the guy to a wooden chair and hammered nails into the guys hands fixing them to the chair armrest. Possibly using a corded drill and drilled into his hands. Thats all I remember lol. Any ideas?	unsolved

All I remember is a scene of a woman in a place where there was no exit (looked like a fancy house or a mansion, not sure) and she went back and forth in a hallway trying to look for a way out. After some time she jumped through something, possibly a big mirror, that turned out to be I think a window and she was finally able to get out of that place. I have no idea of anything else about the movie or how the woman looked like exactly. Googling hasn't resulted in anything.

Theres a guy in a wheelchair.

I remember watching it as a kid, it was one we rented from Blockbuster, in the early 2000's. It was a family movie and was a cute, sweet, and clean comedy. It was about a family of four - a mom, dad, younger son, and teenage daughter - who had a family restaurant. I think it was a pizza place, but I remember that the whole movie took place at the restaurant and it was opening night. The big scene that I remember was too the end. The teen daughter's crush was eating at the restaurant and some how had his food over spiced. His mouth was on fire and he climbed up on the table and breathed on one of the fire sprinklers in the sealing. That triggered the fire alarm to go off and all of the sprinklers to turn on. He cooled down his mouth with the sprinkler he breathed on.

whatmoviewasthat	1lanfup	0	TahiniInMyVeins	2025-06-13T18:32:04Z	Was there a 90s indie movie about a murderous homeless kid and the king of the hobos and magic or was I too high I was an early cord-cutter and Netflix subscriber. I also used to be a pot head in my 20s. I spent a crazy amount of time in the late 90s and early 2000s getting higher than Sputnik and watching everything under the sun from obscure foreign films to indies to nature documentaries to The Prisoner (highly recommended) three times in a row. One particular movie stands out as every few years it pops into my head and I go searching for it and cannot find it. It wasnt particularly good, but it was so different and DIY and weird that I have always been curious to learn more about it. \- Protagonist was a homeless kid/street urchin \- There were dark urban fantasy elements \- Climax included a the King of the Hobos wizard in some kind of underground sewer lair \- Movie ends with the kid sneaking onto a rich guys yacht, brandishing a knife, as its leaving port for a trip around the world. Implication being the kid is going to murder the guy I guess??? \- There was a text font at the end claiming a role playing game based on the movie was in development. Ive tried looking for the game as well to no avail. \- Believe the movie was shot in the 90s, possibly early 2000s. The clothing style/fashion definitely had that energy. \- Very low production values \- Was very high when I watched this but at least 80% sure I did not imagine it Like I said not necessarily a great film but theres still something sad about how much art  even weird crazy art  that is getting lost as content gets either streamed or forgotten.

The setting seemed asian, though it might be made by US. Basic plot of the story was about a girl and her cat. A prince (?) passed by their village, but for some amusing series of coincidences, he only saw either the cat or the girl - but never both at the same time. And it happened so fluidly, that he thought the poor girl was under a curse (where she turns into a cat every now and then), so he made it his quest to release the girl from her """"""""curse"""""""" (or at least, that's how I understood it back then; hey, I was barely 10 years old then!). Long story short: there was an incident where the cat was swept away in the river (or flood), so the prince valiantly rescued the cat (thinking it was the girl), and sort of confessed his love for the girl (who at this point of the story, was already intentionally tricking the prince with the cat-body swapping antics). The girl, who was hiding within earshot, couldn't help herself and burst out laughing loudly and uncontrollably - to the surprise of the prince, who just realized that he was being pranked all this time. I don't recall what else happened, but I do wanna watch this movie again with my daughter.

The youtube shorts I saw made it look cool but idk the name. It should a black guy who helped dead people cross over and showed then their loved ones before he took them across what looked like a sea of sand. One person i think was a guy who drowned and he got revives while talking to the ferryman is what Ill call him. And another short showed i think a girl who was mad about the death thing and refused to believe it telling him to take her back	unusable			TV show

My dad says it was called psychic surgery, but I can't find anything named that or similar. He says it was very bloody, and features a tribe that removed organs with just their hands (the psychic surgery). But the unique thing was, a quick 4 note tone would play with increasing pitch before anything violent, and then decreasing pitch after the violent parts. Any ideas? He still has ptsd when he hears similar sounds as the tone that played.	unsolved

May have been around 2012. Kind of an indie film. Likely no big names attached to it. It started with a guy in a college dorm walks into a room, looking for a roommate, where there are candles in a circle with one candle in the middle. He blows out the middle candle and finds himself trapped in some sort of Limbo. The setting is like Coherence. Hes in the house, but its pitch black outside, and theres no way out. Most of the movie has him tormented in the isolation. No threats, but sounds and shadows all over to almost make him go insane. The ending involved &gt;!his parents and little sister showing up at the dorm. The candle set up is the same. The little girl blows out the candle and the three end up in the Limbo place and swap places with the guy. He finds himself back and sees the roommate. They both know what happened. They exchange concerning looks and leave the house without saying anything!&lt;

It was a British (?) assassin type guy with glasses walking through a mansion and killing a bunch of people by shooting through walls. I think there was a squad of dudes in there going after the glasses guy. After shooting a bunch of folks he stops and takes off his glasses, just to then be killed.

I loved it, and want to show it to my kids, but I have been trying for years to find the name on Google with no luck. It was about a kid who, with her extended family, traveled to this mansion of a recently deceased family member. I remember there was some kind of mystery they were trying to solve in the creepy old place, and maybe a creepy butler? The details get foggy. I specifically remember they mentioned the word """"""""Windfall"""""""". For some reason that stuck with me. There was definitely some sense of competition on who was going to inherit the wealth. I remember it being very macabre, which explains a lot about my teenage years that followed. That's all I remember. I hope someone can help! Thanks in advance!

The grandfather comes out of the house and let's the boy choose the wine they will then drink. The boy gets just little bit in his glass, while the grandpa drinks normally. But before that the grandpa start some kind of speech or wisdom about wine. Kind of like: Wine will always tell you the truth, it can't an wont lie to you, If there is something wrong in the taste, you know it. I think it goes something like that.

Here's what I remember * I watched it on TV as a child, so it will have come out before the year 2000 (may possibly be a made-for-TV movie/mini series?) * I believe it took place in the south with some flashbacks between when a character was younger (pre-civil rights), and a more modern time (though it may not have been up to the time the movie itself was made). * Some sort of event or crime happened (I believe it was race-related and may have been a lynching) and was witnessed by a child, and they went mute. * They may have been developmentally disabled in some way (or possibly were just so traumatized that they developmentally stayed in a childlike state) * I believe there was also a family of several women who were taking care of or were friends with this child * I believe I remember there being a tree that was set on fire Let me know if you have any ideas, and thanks in advance for the help! Adding more details in case anyone else goes searching for this, in case this post helps- It's the 1996 made-for-TV movie Stolen Memories: Secrets From the Rose Garden starring Mary Tyler Moore, Linda Lavin, and Shirley Knight. A boy (white, with brown hair) named Freddy goes to live with his 3 Great Aunts for the summer. One of the aunts is mentally disabled due to being almost drowned by a mysterious man when she was very young. The boy befriends her, and she introduces him to her """"""""friends,"""""""" who are actually the garden flowers. Freddy finds and restores an old blue bike that was originally a girl's bike, and has some trouble with bullies who roll him in poison oak and tease him. As the film goes on, the disabled aunt keeps having flashbacks of the events leading up to her attack. Towards the end of the film, there is a country fair where the aunt sees the mystery man again, who turns out to be a member of the KKK who wanted to kill her when she was younger because she was a witness to a lynching. He tries to drown her again, but she is saved by the boy, her sisters, and the brother of the boy who was lynched (who is also a family friend).

whatisthatmovie	1khh8gr	0	CLHCat79	2025-05-08T04:09:03Z	Does the plot of this romantic cooking movie, that came out between 2010 and 2021, sound familiar to anyone? Please post, if even part of the plot sounds familiar because I'm not 100% sure that I'm not confusing this movie with the plot of a similar movie set in a B&amp;B, with a celeb chef in hiding. # I'm pretty sure the movie came out between 2010 &amp; 2021. I most likely watched it on Tubi, Crackle, Hallmark, UP Faith &amp; Family or Pluto. # The plot of the movie as far as I can remember is this: a woman comes back to her hometown, where her family's diner/restaurant, (possibly set in a coastal town, or lake town), is in some kind of financial trouble. I believe the woman is a chef, caterer or some kind of event planner. Or maybe not. I just remember she helped create the new menu and she disliked the head chef at their first meeting. # She clashes with the head chef (who I believe is a well known chef, in this movie's universe), that her father hired. I think the father is planning to sell the restaurant to the celeb chef but the daughter's arrival back home changes that plan. They have different ideas of what the diner should and shouldn't serve, with her thinking that his dishes are too fancy for their diner. They eventually end up compromising as they redesign the inside of the diner and the diner's menu. # They find love along the way. It was a modern style restaurant that changed its style and menu I also remember that the diner had red and white checkered tablecloths and their were booths as well as tables and possibly out door tables too. # Some of the details could have been from another movie, I hope not. I think there also might have been another restaurant in the town that was taking their business and that was one of the reasons why they were in financial trouble.

NameThatMovie	1kfqk6p	0	ThrowawaySmiski	2025-05-05T23:44:25Z	Forgotten horror movie So, I watched this movie as a young kid, it was late at night and aired on television (nothing fancy just a random free channel), and I remember bits and pieces of it but I can't seem to think of the name. The few details I remember are that this family of four (I believe) a mother, father, eldest was a girl and youngest was a boy (I think, may have been more kids but I only remember two I think there may have been a third (maybe another girl?) When they moved into the new house, they had a basement, and there was this small closet/cellar in a corner, and inside was some kind of demon? I don't think we ever saw the full thing, just eyes and mouth. I remember that the daughter at one point broke a window on the second floor, I think, and jumped to escape amidst the chaos of the demon reeking havoc. I think the movie was from any where between the 80s to very late 90s early 2000s and I think I remember another movie coming on after it that was related to it, or maybe I'm bluring two movies together??? I don't know, but I really want to find this movie and just can't seem to! All that comes up is """"""""The cellar"""""""" (1989), which isn't it! Solved! Thank you to the commenter who helped me realize it was Amityville (1979!) >�

whatsthemoviecalled	1k6vm91	0	Yesthisbob	2025-04-24T15:50:19Z	I need to find an adventure movie from years back Sadly I remember very little, only 3 key details. I know it is very Indiana Jones esque, so it is a treasure hunt of some sort for an artifact/place. There is a scene near the end where they enter the cave system, and one of the bad guys goes into the wrong direction and gets eaten by a giant spider. And the main bad guy dies via being pushed into lava as he fights the protagonist while everything crumbles around them. I know that is very little information but I sadly don't remember anything else from the movie, it is just really nagging me.

It seemed to happen in the second half of the 20th century. There was a very somber/night aesthetic. The main character and his double were bald and possibly 50yo ? Maybe they were Jewish ?

It was probably an American movie, and it really stuck with me because of one very disturbing scene. The movie is about a family  a mom, a dad, and 4 or 5 children. Most of the kids were boys, but the youngest was a little girl, around 2 years old. The family had an old-style Volkswagen van (one of those iconic ones from the 70s or 80s). At one point in the movie, the mom goes to work, and the dad stays home with the kids. While shes away, the dad plans a prank that ends up being extremely dark. He dresses all the kids in white, stages them as if they were dead, and uses ketchup to simulate blood. When the mom gets home and sees this, she completely breaks down, screaming and crying, thinking he has killed their children because of the knife in his hands. Then the kids get up and hug her, and she realizes it was just a prank. I dont remember much else about the movie, but that scene is burned into my memory. I would really appreciate any help identifying this movie. Thank you in advance!	unsolved

The story is that a group of friends was in a car crash which killed one of them, as a way to grieve they go to a cabin to get their minds off it. There is a scene at the wake where a family member (uncle I believe) yells at the young protagonist (female) saying it was her fault, I think, and wishing it had been her, then a friend steps in to diffuse it. At the cabin someone starts hunting the group of friends and it ends with a revelation (it was the uncle). It didn't seem at all like a big budget movie and no actors that I could recognize/name.

Ive never seen it only a clip on YouTube and I cant for the life of me find the clip or what this movie could be through a Google search. The movie is definitely an action movie. Plot of clip: Man tries to kill what appears to be his best friends wife because shes a spy/double agent against her husband. From what I recall in the clip theyre all having dinner at someones home. One of the guys there is suspicious of his best friends wife and her best friend so he kills the wifes best friend. The husband doesnt wanna believe that his wife may not actually be who she says she is and he insists to his friend that he took all the necessary precautions and that theres just no way that his wife isnt who she says she is. The friend I believe then starts insinuating that the house is bugged and I believe uses radio frequency or something like that to prove to his friend while the wife is begging and pleading for him not to test anything because its not true. When its revealed that she has the house bugged, she tries to shoot them and escapes. Does anyone know what movie this is?? Thanks in advance.

It almost had a Lifetime-feel to it, but murder. I believe it was a male who annihilated his family. Or a woman. At least four victims and at least one was a child. Im for certain one was a young boy. In one particular scene, I remember him or her dragging/carrying them to the living room and placing them side-by-side and covering them with (white?) sheets. I believe this was the very ending, and there was much more to the movie than just straight murder. It was a fairly large house, Victorian maybe? Movie from the late 80s or 90s or even super early 2000s. It could have been based on a true story but everything Ive researched has come up null. It gives me big Stephen King vibes. This movie has been stuck in my head for years. And when I say that, I was around 10 years old, flipping through channels when I stumbled upon it. I think it may have traumatized me but I want to see if it actually exists or if it was just a nightmare. Help me solve this mystery! Many thanks.

I remember there are multiple twists upon twists throughout the film, and it ends with the main character, a short-haired, blonde female cop actually being recruited to some agency or something. I apologize for not having more to go off of. I want to say it was an early 2000s film. Edit: Someone asked if it was Silent Hill, but no. It wasn't a horror film. The twists throughout the film are revealed to not be real and she is actually being recruited/tested the entire time. I want to say it was like a suspense thriller type film. Edit 2: I also remember a scene in slow motion outside in the rain where she sees a male character driving away or walking away, and there's one of those """"""""twists"""""""" that ultimately at the end of the film turns out to NOT be a real twist. I'm sorry if this is all confusing. It's not making much sense to me either at this point. Edit 3: u/ChickenFriedApe found it! It was the movie Basic (2003)

There is one scene I vividly remember where the main character is making breakfast and she looks down at the eggs in the pan which triggers her PTSD as the egg yolks remind her of the aliens eyes. I think it's a relatively low budget production, possibly made for TV. Found! Intruders (1992), it's a mini series. Thanks!	unusable			TV show

Ok, so it's been bugging me for a while, not sure if it is in a movie or a TV show. It's kinda recent, d�finitely post 2000's, I've seen this a few weeks/months ago, but not sure where anymore... So here it goes, the 2 or 3 protagonists are in some sort of bet/contest to prove that they can b� nice and thoughtfull persons, and they end up crashing a wedding. They end up making speeches to the bride and groom, who are both waiting for a family member of each their side to show up. One, I think, is waiting for his aunt, while the other expects her grandma to come, something along those lines. At some point, one of our wedding crashers comes with an elderly woman saying """"""""I found aunt Betty !"""""""", and the groom is like """"""""Come meet my aunt"""""""" while the bride is all """"""""grandma, finally you came"""""""", and that's how they end up discovering that they are actually related... The groom is crushed, basically he is not really pretty, his face looks like h� is mentally challenged, like trisomy or something alike. And he basically realize that he may have lost his only shot at love. At some point, one of the crashers takes up the mic again, saying that after consid�ration, it appears that they have sufficient s�paration in the family tree to consider still getting married and taking the risk... I've seen this and now I can't remember from where, and even who where the wedding crashers, who are basically the main characters. Can you help me ?	unusable			TV show

In color, not black-and-white The plot. A family or someone (girl) moves into an old house. -Or it could be someone is admitted into a hospital or even a mental hospital for an extended period of time, but the building is a large old house. But there are a few people she discusses the events with - so not sure if its her family or other inmates. Soon after the female lead discovers there are beings (like shadows or dark beings?) that come out at night. They hide in the walls? In Other rooms? Or parts of the house that have been sealed off? Not sure exactly tbh As usual, no one believes her but one night she discovers or is brought to an old woman that sits in the top attic room of the building. The room is dusty, dirty and dark. The old woman sits on a chair, staring out of the front top window. They discussed something, details of the plot, or what is happening, how the old lady got there (? No idea) etc., and the female lead, either escapes or is let free and returns to the main part of the house. Some type of event occurs where it is believed that the shadow beings are removed and everything returns back to normal but at the last scene, the young girl is now sitting in the chair in the top attic room staring out the front window. Instead of it being dark and musty, everything is white and bright. * it was not Dont Be Afraid of the Dark& Just watched that and its definitely not it&. Any help in finding/naming this long lost piece of cinematic gold is greatly appreciated. Thanks!!

The main characters are a teenage girl that works as a phone line operator and a teenage boy that is supposed to be a jock or something and I believe works at the radio station. Throughout the movie there is minor talk about there being an upcoming American football game in this small town and near the end of the movie all of the town goes to this game except the main characters and a small handful of others which allows the ufos to cause a bit of mayhem and abductions without being detect. At one point the main girl plays a tape or receives a call from a man who describes an alien encounter before the phone lines get shut down. Also the main characters go to the house of a """"""""crazy"""""""" woman who had seen an abductionn and generally they just learn more and more about abductions in the town throughout the movie. At the end the main characters and a little baby run into the woods and get abducted. Thank you.

The scene took place underwater in some sort of research station or big submarine and there were 3 people: a man, a woman and a little girl (I don't remember if they were a family but I think only one of the adults was the girls parent). they were in a room that was big, rounded and empty (no control panels or similar things) and one side of it was a big window. The adults left the room and the girl looked out the window (you could see only solid blue outside). Then the monster appeared. (after this my memory fades) It was either a big fish or just the eye of a monster and the girl and the monster watched each other for a moment before it swam away (it could have cracked the glass or hit the station). Then the adults came back into the room. From the quality and design it looked like it came out in the last 10-15 years but I could be wrong there.

I dont recall if the man is a witness or a criminal. They get ambushed by a criminal group that wants the man they are protecting. They enter the airport and the movie plays out with the cop group trying to survive and protect the man and also the mans wife who is there. There is one main cop guy who ends up solely protecting the man. A lot of people are killed throughout the movie its pretty bloody. The main cop lady ends up being the leader of the bad guys group. They make the man record some sort of confession video to post online. The movie ends outside of the airport where the bad guys try and blow up a plane or the airport? Not sure of much else.

I saw it when I was a kid, but I only caught the opening scene. It was really dark and I think it took place in a big empty basement. Not quite sure if it was a basement, it was just dark and vast? There was a man in some kind of torture chair, and another man did something really gory to him, maybe gouged his eye or something like that. But the one detail that really stuck with me was a spiral staircase shown right after that. I couldn't watch the whole thing, either I got scared or something interrupted it. I think the movie is from the late 90s or early 2000s. If any of this sounds familiar to anyone, I would love to know what it was.

A family lives a seemingly normal life (maybe two young adults as siblings, woman and man, and I don't think they show the parents), they are home alone and so the woman invites a friend over, the friend likes the brother, can't remember much about that. I think at some point the woman offers the friend to the brother for eating? I don't remember if the friend dies or not, she might have ran away. And at the end, they embrace the fact that they are vampires and decided to run away? And before that, they go to the basement where they have a younger sibling, a boy who is much more feral and blood thirsty. It's been probably more than a decade since I watched it, so sorry for such a bad description, lol.

Both times she wants them to think she has another different designer outfit but she can't afford any so she tailors the one she has. She thinks she has them fooled but then there is talk of another event and the acquaintances all joke about how the dress is ragged and can't take any more alterations. That's when she realizes they know it's the same dress. I can't remember anything else but I think it's a 2000s romcom type thing. Help me please I'm losing my mind. Thanks	unusable			TV show

It was a movie about a woman and a man having an affair and plotting to exchange murder. The woman suggests it so the police can't trace the motive. The guy comes home and sees blood and thinks the woman killed his wife. He then kills the woman's husband (I think it was the husband), in a plane (I think....). And I think he escapes using a parachute. However, the wife shows up saying the blood was from her period. The guy eventually gets caught, and I think the wife and the woman were in it together? Even chatgpt has no idea what that movie was. Has a lot of NSFW scenes.

I remember only parts of the plot (I must say, the plot is... weird): At the beginning of the movie there are 2 male protagonists (let's say A and B), and both work in the police or special services. At one point there is an argument and a fight between them, then A tries to hit B with a huge object on a chain (a hook or a smth other), and there is two plot continuations: 1. The canonical continuation: B dodges, defeats A, and then the movie goes on. There is a woman with him, and at the end of the movie they both end up in a bright room where they have to cut themselves with a scalpel and use a scanner to look for codes inside them both, and then the scene changes to the beach where they are resting. 2. Not the canonical version: B faints from the hit and that's the end. I'm not crazy, that's a real movie I saw couple years ago.

SOLVED!!! *Unable to edit Flair* I remember this one, but I also remember another film very similar to the premise of Birth with Nicole Kidman. It was a woman who lost her husband, but her brother-in-law, which was her dead husband's brother, claimed that he's actually her husband' spirit. The wife initially did not believe that her husband was actually in his brother's body. She thought her brother-in-law was a liar, but eventually, with all the things that he knew, she figured it must be her husband coming back to life; but she realized that her brother-in-law actually just read the letters that was written to her. He studied everything down to a T and was able to Regurgitate the information as if he was him. The movie came out around 2005 to 2008. I cannot remember the actors names nor can I remember the movie title.

I remember it had two blonde women who I think were sisters, though I'm not completely sure. They were kidnapped (or at least was of them, or they were in a group with other people, don't remember ) and taken to a secluded place, like a cabin or shed filled with tools. One of them was tortured, and I clearly remember the sound of a chainsaw, I'm pretty sure that's what was used to amputate her leg. In the end, the other woman saves her, and they both manage to escape. The scenes I remember most vividly are when the woman who saved the other was peeking through piles of wood plates while the other was strapped and the kidnapper was amputating her leg with a chainsaw, and the injured woman (with the amputated leg) being supported by the other as they walk away together. I've never forgotten that image, but I just can't remember the name of the movie. If anyone knows it, I'd really appreciate the help.	unsolved

I don't remember much besides one house of a mother with a drunk husband/boyfriend and son, being suspicious to the main actress. It's been so long since I've seen it so it was released from 2000s-2016, sorry for the large range. The ending was a plot twist where either her child alone or all the other children were found underground/underneath the town through a passage from someone's house. I'm pretty sure she took investigating into her own hands since the disappearances were becoming more frequent and police gave up or she got very little help. The actress looked kinda similar to Naomi watts or Teressa Palmer.	unsolved

It was set in the forest, Siberian wilderness kind of vibes. I don't remember much other than a scene at around the 2/3rds through mark. A village was in flames, and a monster that had been following the main character (male i think) finally is shown after stalking the character for a while. The monster was a large mammal looking thing with large antlers and dark appearance. Please save me I'm starting to think I hallucinated the whole thing.

whatsthemoviecalled	1lil55a	0	antisocial_shut_in_	2025-06-23T16:27:21Z	Please Help me find this movie!! I'm trying to find the name for what I believe is a killer shark movie that would have came out around the late 90s to early 2000s, It was shown on TV when I was about 5-6 year ago (around 2006-2007) and I can only remember the first 5 minutes of the movie. I've tried googling it but I can't find it anywheres so maybe someone here will know. Bare in mind that I saw this once about 20 years ago when I was a child so I might not be completely correct about all the details. This seems like a long shot but hopefully someone will know this movie! The first scene i remember i believe is the opening scene, and starts out in one of those sea paddock that has an underwater gate to the open sea and a facility built on top of the water (kinda like the ones they keep dolphins in? But has a warehouse looking building on top), there is railing and metal bridges going over the water. I believe there is a tour of the facility going on and the dialog introduces the facility as a military/private contractor type reseach facility. Theres a bunch of men in swat gear patroling around the water and I think a dummy/food is lowered into water and it gets eaten by whatever is in the water (i believe its a shark trained to kill ppl but idk) Anyways something goes wrong and the shark/whatever is in the water escapes and there's a scientist/researcher who runs to stop the underwater gate from opening via a wheel and he fails to keep the gate closed , thus the shark gets loose. And thats all I remember about the first scene The second scene I remember happens right after the first one, its a time skip to like 10 years into the future where I believe the scientist/researcher who couldn't stop the gate from opening is homeless and living in a box on a walkway by the beach. I believe he's homeless because he tried to warn people about the killer shark/thing in the water and the company fired him/discredited him. And thats all I got. I dont believe the films centers around the scientist/researcher but I think he's an important character that tell the actual main character what's going on with the shark. If anyone knows this film pls let me know! And thanks for your help!	unsolved

I'm pretty sure it's either two girls, or one girl and one guy. They're biking through a forest when more and more creepy looking people show up. I can't remember if they're clowns or not but they just look... not normal. These two get more and more freaked out and more and more freaky looking people start chasing them until eventually the two people are so distracted that they bike their faces right into some barbed wire. Every time I have tried to find it, I only get results about Maniacs (2001) or Wrong Turn (2003) these are definitely NOT the movie I watched.

The best known are probably Sin City and Sky Captain and The World of Tomorrow but I also remember Casshern (Japan), Immortel, ad vitam (France), The Spirit, 300, MirrorMask, Suckerpunch, and one other that I cannot remember the name of. What I remember about the plot is a woman looking for her brother who may be suffering mental issues or traveling between two realities. In the possible alternate reality he is an assassin or possibly some sort of hero or anti-hero that wears a mask that I remember looking like a Kodama from Princess Mononoke but just the eyes without the mouth, I think the mask was made up of bandages or a padded fabric. I think for the climactic scene he had a sniper rifle in a clock tower where he was behind a giant clock face and huge gears. I'm not sure of the country of origin, it could have been in English or subtitled.

I dont remember much so I dont think I'm gonna be of much help but I could definitely recognize a screenshot of some scene. I dont remember the main plot or characters. I pretty much only remember it was based on some dystopian future Earth, at some point it is revealed that humans are either born or cloned or something along the lines in some sort of laboratory which is a really weird oval shaped structure which floats above the city. The oval building has a very strange interior with alien looking shapes and doesnt look like a laboratory at all, there is an old man working in this structure. It had action and the protagonist might have been a woman, but I dont remember that well. The art and architecture of the film had some frutiger-aero style and the film must be from between 1990s and early 2000s, it could be older that that tho.

I'm trying to remember an old cartoon or movie I watched when I was a kid and I can't find the name. I'll list what I remember to see if anyone recognizes it: """""""" The protagonist is a young adult or teenager, probably oriental (Japanese or Chinese, I'm not sure). """""""" She has a panda that talks to her (I don't know if it's a magical animal or a talking friend). """""""" I remember she used potions in square bottles, usually pink.

I'm looking for a movie I am unable to recall where the opening score is this tropical sounding music that may be xylophone or steel drum or something similar to that. I remember it being a really lighthearted fluffy movie like a rom-com or fish out of water story. I thought it was Joe vs. the Volcano but it was not that. It's something similar in tone. The movie closes with the exact same tropical-sounding score. I'm pretty sure it's a movie from the 80s or possibly 90s. Can anyone help me? I can't think of it. Thanks.

I fear the memory is so distant that I dont have too much information to offer but I want to know if anyone would know this movie. It feels like a fever dream. Ive tried to search for RedBox archives but no luck. We probably rented this when I was 8-12 years old, so that would be 2008-2013, but I feel the movie could be a little bit older (maybe 2000 and so on as it had spy kids-like special fx.) I dont remember many details but this movie was VERY bizarre &amp; probably in the fantasy genre. I assume it was not a theatrical release in the US as I had never heard of it. This was a live action movie with 2 children as the main protagonists, as well as one adult (I think male), and one adult male antagonist. These could have been the same person lol. Now I dont know many details, but what I can say is there is a central carnival theme to the movie, I believe at some point theyre on some sort of carnival ride. The antagonist is a swindler type character. I remember the carnival scenes being vividly colorful. I also remember an outdoor stage setting. Some comparisons that I can draw style wise are Pan, Sharkboy &amp; Lava Girl, Spy Kids, Mr Magoriums Wonder Emporium, and finally&.. what I can REALLY say is similar to the vibe is the Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite scene from Across the Universe. In a different subreddit, someone offered Something Wicked this Way Comes and that is the closest I can find in theme and style, but what I remember is more 2000s goofy/weird and modern. Even Mr Dark seems pretty close to what I can imagine the antagonist is, but that is a little too old and doesnt look like what I remember. Im sure it is not these movies: Cirque Du Freak: The Vampires Assistant, Sideshow, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus Something Wicked This Way Comes	unsolved

This happened so long ago that Im not even sure if it really happened or if I just imagined it. Hopefully this will make sense to someone out there who has seen this too. I was like 10 or 11 years old standing outside a Japanese import shop at a tiny mall in Boston. It was some time in the early 90s before anime got really popular in the US. There was a tv in the shop window playing short promo videos of various anime movies. There was one ultra gory sequence that has scarred me for years and I cant figure out what its from. Ive searched all over Google but I cant seem to track it down. Maybe someone here can help me. All I can remember from the scene is there was some guy standing in a barren wasteland or arena of some sort, who kinda looked like Goku from Dragon Ball, going through some painful transformation; skin tearing in various places, sharp teeth poking through his shoulder, lots of blood, etc. The camera pans to a couple side characters sitting across from him, cowering in fear, (I think it was a girl with a kid, or maybe an anthropomorphic dog-person or something, idk its all a blur). So the camera snaps back to the guy whos now doing the vibrating with rage trope and screaming in agony, blood gushing down his whole body, then HE FCKING EXPLODES into a cloud of viscera and his skin splatters all over the poor secondary characters like a raincoat made of spaghetti sauce. Then the camera cuts back to his feet and it does that slow ominous camera pan upwards to reveal hes transformed into some muscular demon/monster/man thing with a werewolf head sticking out of his shoulder. And I think he was doing the muah-ha-ha Im so evil now! laugh. I dont remember anything after that, probably because I ran away screaming. I kind of forgot about it for a while afterwards. I think my brain repressed it until I was older and something unlocked the memory. I thought I finally found it a couple years ago when I discovered Devilman: The Birth from 1987. The main character looks very similar to what I remember, but he never explodes or grows a 2nd head in any of his OVAs so that cant be it. Does this sound familiar to anyone? Or am I mistaking a nightmare for an actual experience? Seems too specific for me to have imagined it out of nowhere but hell, I have zero proof of its existence so I really dont know anymore. TL;DR: 80s or 90s horror anime where a guy explodes into a two-headed blood monster who looks like a red Devilman with no pants. **UPDATE** I think I might have found a solid lead; I searched for 90s anime store demo vhs and this popped up. This is probably what was playing in the window that day. If not this exact one, it must have been something similar, right? Im going to Google each of the movies listed on this tape when I get home from work. Hopefully this is it. Wish me luck! [Manga Video 1996 VSDA Convention Sampler VHS PROMO SCREENER Ghost In The Shell](https://www.ebay.com/itm/146649719694) **UPDATE 2:** Theres a very very strong chance this is from The Guyver: Bio-Booster Armor from 1989. I looked up some gifs and there are plenty of skin-tearing monster transformations. Hoping I dont have to sit through the entire 12 episode series to find the right one. My apologies to the sub if this ends up being a tv show rather than a movie.	unsolved

whatsthemoviecalled	1ljzcbm	0	Tlim8	2025-06-25T07:28:36Z	Trying to find out a old movie about the young boy and old man in sea Hi, Im trying to find a live-action movie I saw on Australian TV many years ago. I only watch a little bit of the movie on TV so I don't have a lot of information. The movie is probably from the 70s, 80s, or 90s or early. It featured a young boy and an old man going on some kind of sea adventure possibly involving a boat, maybe treasure or a quest. The movie was in English. It was probably American or European movie. The story might be set in a fantasy world and medieval tone. The most scene I remember is this: * The old man suddenly seems to hallucinate, he's playing cards with people who aren't really there, and at some point, the old man seems to be tired and his body is slowly collapsing (start to look skeletal or zombie) * The hallucination ends when the young boy shouts and shake him or wakes him up. * The old man seems to be happy and appreciated for what the young boy did. Whats sticking in my mind is that the movie title might have been the the old man's name or something like """"""""the adventure of..."""""""" or """"""""wonderful of..."""""""" in the title. I could be wrong about this. Any ideas?

It seemed like a more serious movie, maybe even a modern cowboy deal? The character in question seemed to be of questionable morality and the others were seeking his input somehow. When they approached him, he was sitting on an outdoor toilet handling business. Maybe reading a newspaper or smoking a cigarette? The other two or three people walk up and potentially say his name. When they do this he stands, reaches around his body, and gives a single wipe before addressing the other. I think he pulls his pants up at this point.

Long time ago, and that is more than 30 years ago, we had this movie on kids program on TV. It was about two siblings ( syster and a brother) that were on a scientific field trip with school to a museum (I think) when they enter a grandfather clock and go back in time. Every time they pass a door the time changes. They go through the history of that city by passing through doors. I remember a scene clearly when a king asked the girl about the outcome of the coming war and she didn't want to tell him that he will lose. For some reason I think it was about Bratislava but I am not sure. I have been looking for that movie for a long time and will be so grateful if anybody could help. THANK YOU IN ADVANCE!	unsolved

A horror movie from the 80s or 90s, where the main character, who is a Caucasian lady, becomes a demon. When she transforms, she becomes promiscuous and her hair turns red, in a short wild hair style. Also her face turns white, and she kills men after she has sex with them. I believe this was spoofed in the movie Dont Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood, the scene where Loc Dogg and the lady have sex in the van. This is where the gift that I linked came from, this is similar to what she looked like. Please help. Ive been looking for this movie for years! I rented it from Hollywood years ago.	unsolved

Having said that, it kind of reminds me of Abby (1974). Which is basically a blaxploitation version of The Exorcist. But instead of a little girl being possessed by a demon. It's about a church woman who gets possessed into being sexually promiscuous (and kills people). Or maybe Demons (1985)	unsolved

Really it's more a play of the trope of a quiet religious girl actually being the wild, sexed up troublemaker. Taking the punchline to such an extreme that she appears possessed is perfectly normal for a Wayans parody, if not the entire genre of spoof comedy. Now you may remember a similar scene from a horror movie circa 80s/90s, I don't doubt it. As a common trope it was used to good effect in countless horror shock of the time when a """"""""good girl"""""""" gets possessed. Countless italian made demon slashers, and dtv haunted house movies of the era have a scene you could be remembering. If you want to actually find the movie you and your sister saw you're going to need more than this reference...

The big bad businessman wants to commandeer the kids' favorite park to drill oil he thinks is in it, and at the climax of the movie they realize it was never oil, it's chocolate syrup from an old Hershey's factory that the park was built over.

I can't remember much. The protagonist (male) was isekaied from real life (I think it was Japan) in another world. He is from a prophecy with dragons and there's a dragon in the end too. The humans there are hostile against the humanoide demons but they aren't the bad guys. He befriends a girl from them. I searched it for a long time without success. As soon as I see the titel or pictures from it, I will know it's this one. I hope someone knows which movie I'm talking about.	unsolved

I watched this movie I believe on Comcast On-Demand probably in the early 2010s but can't be sure. Some specific things I remember about the movie are: I believe the vacation home was very strange like made out of concrete kind of brutalist? Pretty sure the place they get abducted to is some facility under the vacation home. (Its not Cabin In The Woods) Think the vacation home turned out to be a house one of the characters was watching for someone he worked for. Two of the people abducted are strapped to medical tables, one is given an injection of some kinda of bioweapon and the other is the control but they don't know which is which. They manage to escape but of course the one who got the bioweapon dies while on the run. One person gets tied to a pole in a basement (parking garage maybe?) and is shot while another has to perform emergency first aid on them. Starts with the movie's antagonist shooting them in the arm or leg, then the stomach, so on. Pretty sure it was a b rater horror film. I'll try to think of more details but if someone has any leads or ideas I'd really appreciate it! Thanks!	unsolved

Near the very end of the movie, the hitman gets his target, one of the movie's other secondary characters (maybe one of the antagonists).

Guy has regenerative powers, there was a scene where he was in a car with his parents when he was a child? they crashed into a train and chemicals get spilled everywhere and he gains powers from it. He became a superhero and doesnt know he has regenerative powers until he discovers a black and white film of him getting shot in the head by a dude with a gun. there was also a plot where he has a romance plot with a female superhero. There is a scene where there are cops infront of a building and the female superhero arrive and the cops say something along the lines of ''The heart stealer is on the roof'' and when she gets to the roof, the superhero is setting on a chair with a romantic dinner infront him for them to enjoy. I unfortunately can't remember what their suits looked like.

I saw it sometime between 2008 and 2012, late at night, one of those things you watch just because nothing else is on. It was black and white, definitely an older movie. What I remember is a bunch of men sitting around drinking, in a place kind of like a tavern not a bar, more traditional. The movie was mostly just dialogue. There was this one guy talking about how much he missed his girlfriend or wife, and he kept saying how even though she had small boobs (I know), he loved her so much and missed her like crazy. It stuck with me for some reason, maybe because I have been trying to name it. I didn't even like it that much but it's eating me away. Please help.	unsolved

I never saw the movie but for some reason part of the trailer is stuck in my head. Its about 2 (I think) friends going on a road trip to see the world& and have a little fun along the way The only scenes I can remember is them passing someone with (a) sheep on like a one lane road. (Which makes me think UK. Maybe Scotland/ireland?) Then one scene involving like a bar fight, at least them in a bar. Guessing it was either an indie film, or a small production company, just by the fact I cant find it. Ive googled every movie I can think we owneds opening. Again going nuts lol.

Maybe you can help: The movie was set in a fantasy world. I believe the main character was a young girl. In a culminating scene, the evil queen captures her, and this queen has a penchant for boiling her captives alive. As the girl is being lowered into boiling water, in what's essentially a giant teabag, two fairy girls that the main character had encountered earlier in the story swap places with her. An ancillary character explains that fairies actually LOVE boiling water, and we cut to the fairies splashing around happily inside the teabag thing. Does anyone have any ideas?

I remember nothing but one single thing from the opening or ending trailer, but I will come back soon to this detail. The show is NOT supernatural and it plays in our time and world. There is always a lot of forest and nature in the episodes. The thing I remember is that during the opening credits ( maybe ending credit but I think opening) there are a lot of scene from the show that are shown rapidely, and one scene is a dragon/dinosaur head sticking out of a lake. I remeber the episode and it is not a real animal (NOT supernatural) but a fake dinosaur machine build by some bad guys to scare off some other people if I remember right. So, in the opening credit there is briefly a fake dino head seen sticking out of water. I thank all of you for your help	unusable			TV show

whatsthemoviecalled	1lhtux9	0	TTheuns	2025-06-22T17:45:04Z	A movie about a chase between a couple and a semi truck. Before the obvious gets mentioned: it's not Joy Ride, it's not Rest Stop. A couple is driving an American car (I believe it was a 70s Jeep Grand Cherokee or Wagoneer), somewhere in a deserty area in the USA. They stop at a rest stop, the man gets out to go to the bathroom or make a call at a payphone or something like that. Meanwhile the woman stays in the car and gets harassed by a semi truck driver. The semi truck driver threatens her and the woman ends up driving off, with the semi chasing her, and I believe even shooting at her. The man steals a car or asks someone to chase them. It's been over 10 years since I saw this, so details are blurry or non-existent. I hope anyone has their bell rung by this.

I have been trying to figure out what this movie is for many years now and no amount of googling has worked! It was an animated movie that I watched as a child (maybe around 5 years old) in the early 90's. I believe they were animated animals but no clue beyond that. At one point, they've taken a boat (I think) up towards the clouds, and one of the main characters says not to worry, """"""""I know these clouds like the back of my hand!"""""""" and then, once inside the clouds, realizes they may be wrong and says """"""""Wait a minute!

It was all white and he was washing himself with some soap. Behind him was either white tiled wall or white shower curtain, I'm not sure. Behind that curtain was a figure of a person, presumably male, with a beak like as if it was wearing a bird mask. This figure was walking from one side to the other and the man seemed unaware of its presence. Maybe because it was just some shadow/ghost. Again I'm not sure. But you could still hear the sound of fast footsteps on the wet tiles and someone's whistling. Either the man's or some other person's that was in the public showers. I've seen this somewhere around late 00's and early 10's. I don't even know if it was a scene in the movie, series or commercial. It might've been anything at this point. I have to find it.

The only part I remember is this lady and a guy walking into some place at night and going through a parking lot when all of a sudden a car backs into her and almost hits her. She was being harassed by some spirit/demon or whatever and she was trying to get help. I think she was pregnant but I'm not sure. And also I believe the guy was filming the whole thing, making it a found footage film. At first I thought it might've been a Paranormal Activity movie but I rewatched them and didn't find that scene in any of them. I don't know any of the actors or other parts of the movie but I really want to find it, been looking for it for YEARS.

Then the therapist sends her to the psych ward. And there she stumbles across a nurse who's a sick guy basically he gets obsessed with her and he keeps bringing her food AND DRUGS ))) these drugs were given only for her so he can make sure she stays in the hospital forever so he can keep watching her. and then he tells her to escape the hospital with him and to live in the woods with him. Then she refuses and yell at him. Then she tries to escape by her self and he keeps running after her.

This is an old movie I saw on late night TV about 30 years ago, so my recollections arent the best, but here goes nothing. I believe it was British. It involved numerous people crossing paths with and plotting against the antagonist who was some kind of conman I think? One character was an older lady who I believe was a novelist, at one point she tries to acquire a """"""""mickey finn"""""""" which is some kind of knock out drug. She's hilariously misinformed and out of her depth trying to buy this from patrons in a seedy pub at the wrong end of town. The one part that is most clear in my memory is the final scene where everyone had ended up on an airship in flight, the antagonist is unaware having been unconscious. He wakes up, berates his would be captors and says he is off to report them to the police before stepping out the door of the airship and falling to his presumed demise.	unsolved

It had some scenes with parades (I believe filmed in mexico) that had animal carcasses. It had roman uniform wearing soldiers and a theif trying to get their food. I remember a character going up a building and talking to a higher power before being sent on a mission. The movie ends with the director (I think?) breaking the 4th wall, I think it was because it was alluding to film being the latest religion in history. It looked like it was made in the 70s but I can't remember more details to find it.

The film was likely late 90s or early 2000s and followed two children who discovered fairies in a local woodland and had to help them defend their home from some kind of evil creature. Definitely live action. Notable scenes I remember include the parents of said children believing them to have gone missing and deciding to move away or leave so they can stay safe, but are eventually convinced to join the fight. The finale follows the evil creature in the centre of the forest surrounded by the fairies, which are shown as points of different coloured light, and they throw smaller points and beams of light to attack the creature. The film was definitely European or American produced, and likely Direct to DvD. It was specifically not the Fairy King Of Ar. Any help in figuring it out would be super appreciated, thanks in advance.	unsolved

Basically, humans created androids to fight their wars and then the androids wiped them out. The plot follows a solitary android whos searching for something. He comes across a village of other androids thats run by a few different bully factions. Water is a huge commodity, if I remember correctly. One of the baddie factions is just three identical, female androids who are dressed in all black and wear sunglasses. There arent any guns left but everyone has these cyber daggers that activate when unbuttoned from their harness and seem to propel themselves at great speeds when thrown. There was a female android bartender, also, who was walked all over by the other androids. There was another side character who got decapitated early on and is constantly searching for a better body. I think the main male character was a British actor but could be mistaken. Any help?

The actors playing the 2 main criminals were members of a band together in real life - I think they might have been from Norway or something too, but I might be making that up. One of them had a (dyed?) mohawk and the other was like white-blonde with a very cool haircut. Over the movie, the android slowly gains more &amp; more knowledge &amp; sentience &amp; a sense of self. I watched it about a decade ago, and I think it had been released just 2 or 3 years earlier.

The main plot point was that there were 2 brothers - one of them was a priest in some small village and the other was a gangster in some crime organization. The former just as the movie starts finishes his 20 something year sentence for a robbery (?). He has a bunch of valuable gems stashed away somewhere but can't get them for some reason and because of that he sends his brother to do that for him and do a deal with some mob family. While the gangster's brother is away he impersonates a priest and tries to stay low and not reveal his past to anyone. I remember crying laughing at some scenes and it would be awesome to have a chance to see it again. Edit1: Now that I thought about it I'm very confident it was a french movie.

NameThatMovie	1la0vb8	0	Ok-Initial-4195	2025-06-12T23:12:46Z	Trying to find an old movie: masked teens go place to place, one dies in each scene I saw this movie as a kid (probably around 2005 or earlier) on a rental DVD in Japan (Japanese dubbed). Heres what I remember: - It was a foreign film (likely American or European), possibly released in the 1990s or early 2000s. - It featured a group of wealthy teens (boys and girls, maybe 6 in total). - They wore different types of masks. One of them wore a blank, white mask like the Japanese performer from Golden Bomber (very expressionless). - They were rebelling against adults/society in some way. - They moved from place to place  not just one location like a mall  and in each place, one of them died (often by being shot). - The deaths looked symbolic or acted, not gory or realistic  more like theatrical portrayals. - The police and their parents tried to talk to them, but the kids didnt respond or were not convinced. - The group got smaller and smaller. In the end, I think the leader (a boy) was the last one remaining. - The overall vibe was eerie, symbolic, and felt a bit low-budget or old in terms of video quality. It wasnt a slasher or horror film  more like a psychological or symbolic thriller with social commentary. Does anyone recognize this?	unsolved

About 2 estranged brothers in a segregated futuristic society This movie was played during a free period in class when I was in like middle school, it was an older movie even back then. What I know: Live action Sci-fi What I think I know: Disney Plot: Two brothers (white) were raised together, but at their coming-of-age, the government separated them stating that one brother was elite, and in a higher caste while the other brother had a minor health problem that destined he be a worker in the lower ranks. I believe the """"""""defective"""""""" brother snuck into the area where the """"""""elites"""""""" lived and did so until he found his brother where they had a confrontation I think they swam a great distance in the ocean (defective trying to prove they're equals), and the elite brother starts to drown. The defective brother brings him to safety and they reconcile. It was an older movie (90s or older) but the setting was supposed to be somewhat futuristic (sci-fi).

It may not have been American but it sounded close enough like maybe it was American or Canadian. I think k it came out in 2017 or around there. The main charachter was a young woman who somehow had magic. And the series was a dark fantasy series. A little medieval. And she needed to cross the moors for some reason. And there was a dark sorcerer somewhere. And then she somehow met a master who was always wearing a hooded cloak and he taught her some magic or something. The girl was courageous and there wasn't any stupid """"""""woke girl logic"""""""" to make her strong. She was just a well written character whose strength came from a place of peace and determination and not plot armor. In the end I think her and friends or maybe a side kick or something won some battle with the big bad sorcerer. The whole movie had a good plot through and through. And it looked a little indie but if you ignored the faded colors a bit it seemed professional. The master who taught her or protected her or whatever is actually famous. I watched the movie and recognized him instantly. I first thought he was Brendan Fraser then I thought he was Nathan Fillamon. Not sure but he looks like them and he's famous.	unusable			not sure of part Mythica-series

Where the authors completely give up on writing female characters that are strong because of determination, grit, logic, or training. Instead they are usually really weak characters that poorly written and use plot armor to punch a guy through a wall. Because writing actually powerful women and girl characters would require too much effort from the writers. It's disheartening to see that powerful women don't get representation. And makes me feel like male writers are writing female characters and just trying to make them strong to go with the trend. Buffy is a prime example of a well written character.

NameThatMovie	1lgvyok	0	Eythyn_93	2025-06-21T12:57:52Z	What is this lost Martial Arts/Action Film? 1970s to 1990s (a hard one to find) Please note: It is like a hybrid of American Samurai, Bloodsport, The Quest, Mortal Kombat, Bloodist 2, Best Of The Best 2 &amp; Gladiator Cop but is 100% not these films and is more realistic and has no mystical elements. Description: The film was in English, I would say the year was anywhere between 1970 to late 1990s. It had a hero (main character) who was an American Navy Seal, I think he was white. I believe from memory he is trying to infiltrate this area or base and he is captured on a mission or seeking his brother who is murdered or captured to. I do recall before the main action of the film starts, there was a build up of the story before all of the fights. Just confirmed recently by another reddit user who has seen it to, there was a love interest in the film. A blonde haired woman with almost unnatural sparkling blue eyes. There is a few scenes with her in the film to. The main (bad guy) was this very well built muscular and big Asian man (Chinese or Japanese) with a fully shaved head and bald. He had a fu man chu style facial hair. He wore a black/grey top but was mainly topless (when fighting) and his wrists had leather bracers. He also wore long black pants and black boots. From memory this is the crime boss's main enforcer. This guy and the crime boss was the target of the main character. There was also another bad guy or villain in the movie to. Another Asian man with another fu man chu facial hair or goatee and his hair was black and long. He wore from memory an all black gi that was a sleevless top to. He had black leather wrist gaunlets with long black pants and black shoes and had an athletic build. He reminded me of Shang Tsung from Mortal Kombat Conquest in a way. This guy was also the crime boss's 2nd enforcer. I remember a particular scene of this guy at some point in the movie, entering this building through like a prison cell door. He then turned around and closed the door behind him and then he walked along this upper catwalk or walkway with a menacing walk and it had like a sideview camera angle of him while walking with some eerie music playing. He then went to go and sit down next to the crime boss and watch people fight in brutal deathmatches above the pit. (I think this is the guy who kills the main characters brother). What stood out about this guy was, he had very long black hair with a long braid. In his braid there was a hidden blade with a weight. He was the only fighter with a weapon and would use his braid as a weapon and flip around alot like a ninja and swing his braid around and cut people up with his hair. He would use all of the momentum from his flipping around to toy with fighters. This guy specifically had a few stand out fights in the film. A few fighting scenes with him I remember were: One fight he was dancing and flipping around, just toying with his opponent. (Using the wushu or capoeira fighting style to do it). Eventually he beat his opponent to death. Another fight I remember he started slicing a guy with his hair slowly and then either strangled the guy to death with his braid or caught him in the throat with the hair blade which killed him. Then the final fight from memory he had in the film I remember was when he was against the hero. The hero faces him and the blade fighter's braid gets caught by the hero or something happens where he makes a mistake and slips where he is then stabbed to death with his own hair blade. Eventually after the bad blade guy is defeated by the hero. There is a final fight against the main villain, (the big bald muscular asian guy) against the hero. This movie was some sort of crime/action movie where people are fighting in illegal deathmatches and they are held prisoner by this wealthy gang or crime syndicate. The winner of the competition gets a massive some of money in the millions which was always on display above the pits near the crime boss. The movie was very dark, gritty and ultraviolent. The fights took place in some rich castle or prison like environment in Eastern Europe, Russia or somewhere in Asia. (I'm not too sure on this). The people would fight on a big dirtpit or sandpit in some kind of death pit. As I said previously, the main bad guys would sit up above and watch, almost like they enjoyed it all and there was a lot of money involved. I feel like there was a rectangular or squarish big black prison cage that had steel bars surrounding the fights on the sandpit. The cage might be mistaken for a large cell block though. As It was like an open abandoned cell block or abandoned prison with a mortar owned by the gang or crime boss. I think bodies were thrown down a drain or chute when people were killed and you had to kill your opponent in order to advance (Gladiator style). The movie was sadistic, depraved, violent and very brutal. Which is why it has stuck with me and everyone else who has seen it for so long. Please feel free to ask me as many questions in the comments for any more information. I hope this film resurfaces soon. Thank you in advance guys.	unsolved

whatsthemoviecalled	1kn93lp	0	EdoErkos	2025-05-15T14:06:58Z	A movie about a man and his many sex partners Hello, I want to rewatch this one movie which I have watched many years ago, I generally remember the plot and even the ending I belive, however for some reason I cannot find it. The general plot of the movie is pretty straight forward, a man in the 1700 - 1800's (very not sure about the timeline, the movie is set in the past) in either Spain or Italy narrates the movie reading from his """"""""Sex Journal"""""""" where he has taken notes about every sexual partner (women) hes have had (hundreds, maybe even thousands). The one woman that he has really fallen for has rejected him but in the end of the movie, finally when they are old and wrinkled they get married and have sex on a ship (not sure about the married part) I also remember a scene where the man has sex with a women in the street, hiding behind a pillar while they cover each others mouths and a scene where he writes """"""""This is mine"""""""" (I think) above a womans vagina with I think fish blood?? and the womans husband finds out and beats her? (or kills her?) I also remember the man's mother playing a big role in his life. For some reason I remember Javier Bardem playing the main role however this is probably not possible as I have searched through all of his films and I think none fit the profile. The more I wrote the more the movie felt like something I've seen in a dream and doesn't actually exist. Note: although it sounds a like a movie about Casanova, I don""""""""t think it is. Any help would be very much appreciated :(

I've spent ages trying to find this film. I used ChatGPT and spent \~ 10 rounds narrowing options. I now appeal to your wisdom. Help me r/whatmoviewasthat; you're my only hope!"""""""" Here goes: I think this was shown in a **Canadian theatre** sometime from about **1975 to 1983** (*possibly* a **made for TV movie** though I don't think so). It was a **low-budget action movie** (lower budget than The Keep or Time Bandits). It had **medieval fantasy** elements (I think European but it could have been Asian, like a Shaw Brothers movie). The tone was **serious** IIRC. There was a powerful **evil character**, *possibly* with special powers. The movie featured a good man or woman who **summoned several different good allies**. These allies seemed distinct to me (e.g., a swordsman, a strongman...). Several or most of these allies died tragically (this was the most upsetting part to me as a child). It may have been an Asian film dubbed into English but I am not sure about this. **It is not** Hawk the Slayer, Sword and the Sorcerer, The Archer: Fugitive from the Empire, Ator the Fighting Eagle.

I don't remember it well, sorry about that. It was about a boy who lived with his father in Denmark - most likely since there were a lot of """"""""swimming houses.""""""""- his mother was an old opera singer, and he would listen to her singing all the time. He also had a great Swiss Army knife that his father gave him, and there was a scene of them choosing a lobster from the market and trying to cook it.

Been looking for 10 years I saw a movie or tv series when I was a kid that scared me really bad. The only problem is I dont have much memory of too many scenes only one in particular. This aired on tv approximately 1994-1995 during the day time based on where I was living at the time. The one scene I remember very vividly is a villain or character accessing a mans home through the garage door using a numeric keypad code located on the garage or house. I vividly remember the fingers pressing in the code and the suspense that followed. This scene really sticks out in my mind. I also want to say the garage door opening and revealing who was trying to get in. I think there was a man (it was only one character) hiding in the house from whatever it was. Im also leaning more towards late 80s or early 90s it didnt appear too old. There was a scene with fire too not too long after maybe whatever was trying to get catching fire cause thats when I screamed for my dad lol. But yea the scene I remember really well was the nails or fingers pressing the code and something happening to get inside the house. There is a chance this was also the main character entering the house to hide but I remember it being really suspenseful. Its not are you afraid of the dark because it was much more adult horror!

whatsthemoviecalled	1lgboau	0	PiccoloInteresting75	2025-06-20T18:43:22Z	Does anyone know of this movie??? ive been looking for it for years. It starts off with a flash back of the main character getting taken away by guards from his mom his mom tells him he needs to go with them to be safe away from the zombies because she knows she's gonna die from the zombies and so is everyone else. Flash forward to the pressent the same guy is late teen 20s. He is in a helicopter and someone is telling him we are here and we need to go now. The main character is white and has brown hair. Further on in the movie the main character is in this cafeteria with his friend. Then the next day or something the girl who is his friend or girlfriend gets called out along with other names to get taken away from the cafeteria. Then he hears her scream and tries to get to her but the guards stop him. Later in the movie he goes looking. For her and finds her organs in a bag and she skin is in a suit bag he is very sad. Then Further in the movie there are 4 or 3 main characters. One gets bit by a zombie he is black and in his 20s and he asks the others to shoot him the wont so he says go Further along and ill shoot myself so I cant infect you so they do and he shoots himself. Further in the movie the main character finds out the main plot of the movie something about it being corrupt or something and the person who is corrupt a woman in a suit says something along the lines of hey this is whats actually going on and takes him into a room with zombies chained to a wall and barrels. It happened before 2019.

If we're thinking of the same one, then there's like, a magical entity she accidentally woke up and it's slowly turning all the other apartment dwellers into magical creatures. I know there's an older woman in one apartment that knows what's going on and is trying to help her brother defeat the entity and I think the older woman gets turned into a tree stump. I know another apartment had a throuple in it, the man got turned into a satyr and his girlfriends into nymphs. There was another apartment with a dwarf man (who might have been a magician?) who drew the girl a picture of a bunny and they had a long talk about magic and magical creatures because of the comfort the idea brought him throughout his life. I remember the girl got preserved in a cocoon/magical casing at some point because she was going to be the 'last piece' of humanity left or something. I hope we both find it!	unsolved

NameThatMovie	1ljwwh8	7	BellaW0lfe1986	2025-06-27T07:16:35Z	The movie is in fact called """"""""Troll"""""""". The mention of the apartment building and the other tenants being transformed is the dead giveaway. At some point in the movie you would encounter a strange pool of green goo which the troll creature eats, which is made of the people it transforms into the goo, while other people become creatures, most of the apartment becomes covered in vines and plants as well as the troll slowly turns the building into its own home.

Night, a man giving oral to his girlfriend in an open-ish space (I believe a car with the doors open?), he gets eaten or killed silently, and a creature/monster takes his place in doing the thing. I remember it being a big snake but that never got me anywhere. Keep in mind everything was fairly censored and dark, I don't believe it was an adult movie I thought it was maybe a scene from Splice (2009) but nope.

I never finished it because it terrified me. Heres what I remember: """""""" A girl at school is called into the principals (or deans) office. """""""" Shes left alone for a while. """""""" A monster or creature appears, and she hides under the desk. """""""" The phone rings on the desk  she tries to answer it& But she ends up grabbing a gross hand or claw instead. """""""" She runs away from the school and hides in a phone booth outside. """""""" Then shes attacked  or surrounded  by a mass of hair, possibly from the monster. """""""" I think she dies at that point, but idk I stopped watching. Other notes: """""""" Likely from the late 90s or early 2000s, aired on Filmnet in that era. """""""" The overall vibe was creepy and supernatural, not comedic or overly gory. Ive never been able to find this film again, and it still haunts me a bit. Does this ring a bell for anyone?

I was very very little when my grandpa gave me some movie trivia. We were watching Turner Classic Movies and he told me to pay attention to the ending scene of a movie he had on. The characters (I think) ended some kind of argument where one left the other in an office or study room or something, and then the point of view switches to the character left in the room, and they slowly turn the gun to themselves and it's very heavily suggested (but obviously not outright stated) they commit suicide by gunshot. The part that was interesting was the ENTIRE movie was in black and white, except the bang made the screen flash in red before the credits rolled. My grandpa, trying to get me interested, asked me how they did that if the movie was in black and white (I was too young to understand how which was obviously animating over the film a la Anchors Aweigh, but I did understand for the most part there was a time that film was only in black and white, so like. 4-6ish?). Obviously I didn't care, so I never bothered to learn the name of the movie, but 20+ years later and now I have a burning desire to figure out what this movie possibly could be called.

Back in elementary school I have a memory of watching a movie about a piano player. it was an old movie possibly in black-and-white, the title was something along the lines of 'X,000 fingers/keys of Mr. Something' and all I really remember was that there was this staircase possibly made of piano keys that was long and winding into an odd basement. I also vaguely remember his bedroom that had a cool old canopy bed where he was talking to a wife or girlfriend at some point. that's really all I can remember.

I can only remember one scene and it is very disturbing. Basically a young white woman is tied down either onto a chair or bed by an older woman (I can't remember if they kidnapped the young woman or if the woman was working for them) and the older woman has a son who was sitting on a chair and he has some neurological issues and I think was overweight. The older woman puts a condom on her son and makes him ejaculate using her hands, she then takes his sperm and puts it into a syringe that she then injects into the captured woman's uterus. I cannot for the life of me remember anything else about this film and I can't find any leads on reddit or using ai film finders. Can anyone help me figure this film out, I'm 90 percent sure this was an American English film but I could be wrong. Thanks.	unsolved			TW: sexual assault

Just saw this scene a year back when my dad was watching TV and I know his dumbass will not remember/know what I'm talking about xD There was a crowd of people I think in the parking lot and the detective wanted to do something or say something but was kind of held back by his higher ups. He started to lose his shit and was punching the air and ending up raising his fist/flicking off the Chief of Police to his right, and maybe some media person to his left. Right after he immediately bows to people around him because he wants them to know he's good with them, but fuck the bosses. I think he gets suspended for this. I think I remember the scene after he was on the phone with his boss who was also asian (but they are working in America, maybe in LA). Film seemed like Rush Hour in that it's a cop movie where it has both seriousness and lots of humor.

I remember this scene from a movie that used to air on HBO a lot back in the day. I swear she had something she put in the water, but I don't know. HBO in the 80s was wild. They showed all these weird films that have sort of vanished but I recall. I will keep looking!

Im looking for an indie Latin American psychological thriller/horror short that Ive seen about 10 years ago. It was hosted for free on a site dedicated to the film, probably made by the director. It was shot in black and white, around 10-15 minutes long, with an unsettling vibe and eerie cool music. I think the title had ~philia in it, maybe referencing a fetish related to surgery or amputation. The story was told from the point of view of a doctor/surgeon who saw himself as a generous, selfless man. He had an MTF trans nurse, a beautiful, cheerful, provocative woman that he called his masterpiece, saying he had done her reassignment and cosmetic surgeries himself. One day, a wounded criminal with a bag of money showed up and threatened him with a gun. The doctor tried to calm him down and offered to help, but the man ended up dead. Other things happened, but I cant remember. (Spoilers from here) The twist was that the doctor wasnt a real surgeon at all. He was a delusional psychopath, maybe a drug addict. The nurse wasnt anything like how he saw her: she looked very masculine and botched from bad surgery, and she hated him because he was threatening to cut off her hormone pills if she ever tried to leave or speak out. The scene with the criminal also played out differently. The man was wounded but not aggressive, he basically handed over the gun willingly. The doctor then shot him and stole his money. Did someone know what Im talking about and ever saw this short?	unsolved

The protagonist is like, ex military I think, is an operative, and I'm pretty sure he dies at the end. The United States is divided and he's got to go to California? And California is part of some conglomeration of states, after a civil war has divided the country. He's being guided by an ai the whole time and I seem to remember the ai is voiced by John Goodman (but not sure). The protagonist gets involved with a femme fatale, and the ai is giving him its predictive analysis which normally he goes along with, but decides to ditch it. And then he ends up getting killed at the end, if I remember correctly. Really trying to remember this one... it was pretty good.	unsolved

Shocking stuff. Theres a young man who, I think, is drafted and, at one point, attempts suicide by slashing his wrists and forearms. Hes saved my a medical staff. The look of wild ecstasy on his face as he cut himself is one thing that was really messed up. I think the actor may have had red hair and I think part of the story was that his parents turned him in for going AWOL but its been a really lingering time. This flick was dark, to say the least.

It's a scene of about 2 or 3 minutes. It's a movie from the 1970s to the 1980s, and the genre is science fiction. All the actors are white, so it seems to be an American or Russian movie. There were female fighters wearing uniforms like white leotards and armed with needle guns. A man who seems to be the protagonist restrains one of the female fighters from behind. Soon after, two female fighters rushed to attack, but the one who was restrained by a stray bullet died. The two people who rushed right after that were also shot in the chest and knocked down in an instant. That's the content.

I half-watched as a kid  dreamlike bathroom, mysterious hole, maybe a murder Back in the early 2010s, I caught part of a late-night movie at my cousins house. I didnt finish it  I was a kid and got scared  but Ive never forgotten how weird it was. My memory might be a bit fuzzy, but heres what I remember: The main character (a guy) was in a surreal, dream-like bathroom space  almost like a hallucination or flashback. Things turned disturbing there, possibly including a violent encounter with another man and something involving broken glass. Then it shifted into a scene where hes either chasing or running from someone through a shallow marsh or freshwater area, with tall reeds everywhere. The whole thing had a very fragmented, disorienting feel. Eventually, he kind of wakes up and realizes hes kneeling on the ground near a hole. Inside the hole is a man's head  and it somehow ends up in his hands. There were some law enforcement figures nearby who thought he was responsible. He looked panicked and scared out of his mind. The movie seemed to jump around with edits and flashbacks. What always bothers my mind is the memory of a bloodied man in a yellow shirt, lying in a boat or a barrel, also missing his head (might as well be the owner of the head). Thats all I remember. This could very well be a mix of real scenes and childhood confusion. Still, Id love to finally know what this movie was. Any ideas?	unsolved

All I remember is binge watching horror movies over 10-15 years ago (I was a toddler). We watched this one film about a detective (I think?) going around trying to solve murders and it ended up being this ghost girl. The only 2 key parts that stood out to me were: 1. Two people walk into a bathroom crime scene, rip open the shower curtain, and this woman's body was folded up worst than a pretzel. 2. Whenever they came face to face with the ghost girl, I remember the subtitles reading """"""""play with me"""""""" and a wispy, ethereal voice. There was one particular scene like that she was sitting on top of a well or a short wall or something, all I remember is it was foggy and very blue. Again, sorry for the vague descriptions, all I have to my memory are these 2 images and not much to go off. I accept I could be mixing movies too because I was so young at the time. Either way thanks in advance for any suggestions!	unsolved

NameThatMovie	1l8eqk3	0	Mrchupaouvaisape	2025-06-11T00:13:49Z	Looking for a teen/adult sex comedy from the 2000searly 2010s I've been trying to find this bizarre sex comedy movie I saw sometime in the late 2000s/ maybe early 2010s, it could have been made early than that, it was just the approximate year I watched it. It might have been a french film, the version I saw was dubbed in French but my parents used to watch all movies dubbed in french so maybe it was not. It was a long time ago and I was a kid so heres what I remember: The story follows two male virgins, (maybe adults, maybe teenagers), who are trying to lose their virginity, and look like dorks or geeks. One of them is quiet, and the other is louder, both are perverts. The quiet one always wears a bucket hat, which was basically his signature look throughout the film. Theres a scene where the quiet one records his neighbors having sex through the window, and its played as creepy/perverted. Theres a weird visual gag where when they get an erection, usually from flirting or seeing a woman, their penis becomes comically hugelike an over-the-top, CGI-style visual joke. In the end of the movie they both get girlfriends and loose they're virginity, (I think the girls were potrayed as ugly, not sure) The humor was really childish, almost slapstick or cartoonish, but still had very adult content (sex, nudity, etc.). I remember thinking it was kind of dumb and absurd, but its a memory from my childhood I occasionally think about.

I was flipping channels as a kid and I saw this single, very disturbing scene from a foreign -language film (possibly Spanish) where a man wakes up in a bed (either in a hospital room or a prison cell) and slowly realises his legs don't work. He starts screaming and shouting and eventually falls out of bed and drags himself to the room's door, which is locked. The scene ended with him sobbing and screaming on the floor. I have never forgotten this scene (obviously!). It would have been on British TV in the very early eighties, in the evening.	unsolved

I've watched a tiktok that shows a tv show/movie where a nurse accidentally kills the patient because someone changed the medication and she has to leave the house by fooling the family. It's an elderly patient and he helps her escape before dying. He helps her escape by telling her to leave and making noise then come back and put the victim robe so that the family thinks he's still alive after she left. I belive that they found out later the the medication was switched by a member of the family on purpose. I think it's a recent tv show/movie. Thanks for any help you can give.

Sorry for the long text but anyhow all I recall are: couple (or a family that soon got split I don't recall) end up at the mansion of a slight weird looking male, sit around a very large dining table at one point, then the couple were in a long hallway that soon had one end wall start to move onto them, after finding a small stuffed hallway closet they then finally found one not-locked door that opened in time for the couple to head into a small stairway just as the door then got crushed by the moving wall, upstairs through a trapdoor was an attic - and while the couple looked around a safe box quietly rolled itself onto the trapdoor causing the two to be stuck up there, they went to sleep on a bed whereas a nearby painting soon was seen having remote eyes where the weird male spotted them sleeping on the bed, the bed mattress did a 'barrel roll' or two which really woke up the couple only for them to then soon notice a small side trapdoor magically open up, turned out to be a slide 'built inside the walls', at a Y fork she went one way while he went other way, he ended up in a deadend that was located outside the weird male's bedroom, while she ended up getting ejected right outside the mansion itself close to where their car was located at only to find two (or few?) strange not-so-human characters a bit """"""""interested in her"""""""".

Been racking my brain to remember an erotic thriller I saw on channel 5 in late 90s/early 2000s. Woman trying to rebuild after a divorce/husband having an affair. She moves into a new house in a nice neighbourhood. Starts a relationship with her personal trainer. Remember there was a conversation about diet as they pack away food. Turns out trainer is also still in a relationship with an Asian girlfriend who I thought was Joan Chen, but all searches come up nil. Unless I am not looking hard enough... I remember the title didn't scream erotic thriller. Also think there is a detective hanging about investigating a murder or something, suspects husband/ex boyfriend. Might have turned out to be the trainer but not sure about that at all. Stand out scenes include main character having sex with trainer in a toilet stall and slashing the tyres of ex boyfriend/husband.

whatsthemoviecalled	1khrlns	0	I_Just_like_Gore	2025-05-08T14:33:05Z	Early to Late 2010's movie about a girl who goes crazy about social media influencing. I remember getting this movie from redbox when I was around 8 or 9, so all i remember is the basic premise and some scenes. its a movie about a girl who decides that she wants to be an influencer so she comes up with something so she could make herself look good. She breaks into another influencers house and steals her dog so it looks like he went missing. She returns the dog so it looks like she found it, and she befriends her. After that she starts getting more and more influencer connections but also gets crazier and crazier. At the end of the movie i think it was in the desert like just some white mini shack where the main character and the influencer who befriends her drops her as a friend and she freaks out over a charger. Sorry if this isnt descriptive enough, haven't watched it in like a decade almost it feels like.

Over time, she befriends this boy and introduces him to her father so that he can take the brunt of his affection and abuse. The movie takes place in either Spain or Italy, with a summer-y feel to it. It's a sad ending, with the boy maybe running away and the father's abuse escalating as a result. In my memories, the girl is played by Dafne Keen but she would've been too young at the time, the actress likely just looks similar to her now. I remember the dad being Jordi Moll� but again, nothing like this movie is on his IMDb page. The movie poster was blue with the girl and boy's heads facing in opposite directions, highlighting their similar appearance.

I remember the basic plot, college students faking their own deaths. But I mostly remember the twist ending where all is explained and one of the main characters gets into Dartmouth. Everything I google comes up with comedies, but I remember the tone being mystery/thriller. Any ideas?

I can remember a scene from a film where the main character meets a troupe of Hare Krishna monks on bicycles covered in light. The MC joins them and they end up near a river, I think this is in New York or a similar big city.

whatsthemoviecalled	1kkj9u2	0	HitoreFlaptey	2025-05-12T03:53:25Z	Old fantasy movie I've had the images from this movie in my head for a while but I can't seem to find the movie. It's from an old fantasy movie that I would have watched in the 80's. As I recall, the story is about a young protagonist who leaves on some kind of adventure, maybe to find some lost magic? There's two scenes that stick out in my mind. In one, the young adventurers get picked up by some kind of friendly tribe. They climb up onto a strange transport animal that carries two baskets, one on each side of it's back. Inside the baskets, it was quite nice and cozy and they meet a tiny old wizard or elder of some sort. In the second scene that I remember: as they are traveling, they stop for a break and our protagonist gets out and walks to the water that's next to their rest stop. I believe he sees something in the water? Either way, he ends up falling in and some far off wizard is seen casting a spell that causes him to not be able to come back up to the surface. He's seen panicking and banging on the surface but he can't come up until the the elder that we met earlier comes along and extends his gnarled old wand into the water to pull him out. I feel like the wand is central to the story somehow... These two scenes have stayed with me for decades, the first because those baskets on that animal looked so cozy and it looked like a great way to travel. The second evokes a bit of a phobia in me and I feel like it would be a terrible way to go so it stuck with me. I would love to re-watch a movie that has left me with such long term memories, but I can't seem to find this movie anywhere! I'd appreciate any help in finding it, thank you!

Since then wanted to re-watch it but I don't remember its name and now barely the plot. So please help me find this movie =-=-. It was a low budget movie probably independent. There was a man jogging peacefully near some farm until he takes a turn in the woods, following where he finds himself being chased by someone or something. Eventually he finds a woman (also jogging) whom he tries to convince about what he had just experienced. Now the guy must have injured his leg somehow (maybe to some trap while he was being chased) because I remember the girl taking him to an abandoned shed after which she left to call for help and the guy faints . The guy wakes up,bound to a tree, to a family standing along with the same woman. They wanted to kill the man but the woman convinces them that she will kill him (or fuck him whatever) alone. When they left she explained the man that the family uses her as bait to bring other people. The two then try to escape and are being manhunted by the family.I don't remember the chase sequence however In the last scene they both are seen on a truck that they stole and out of that place but it's revealed that the truck has a bomb in it and an explosion is heard while the screen turns black. Additional details - This actress had a different accent and speaking style as if English wasn't her first language. The guy was wearing shorts and was muscular but didn't fight a single guy. All the work was done the the women. The family might have been inbread or some cult, other than that they were farmers Two. When these two managed to escape one of the family members now injured was holding the remote to the bomb	unsolved

First movie has the scene from ghostbusters 84 in it. The scene where they are first at the firehouse looking to buy it. Its the exterior shot of the firehouse where the realtor lady is talking. I saw this scene in some movie lately and as a ghostbusters fan i instantly recognized it. I guess due to copyright or whatever, the scene has been mirrored. Obv it would have been a movie made after 84 and set in nyc. I use hulu, max, pluto and tubi and ive browsed every movie i could think it could be and cant find anything. Could have been a tv show then. Anyone? Second movie was something made in 90's. I swear the scene had bruce willis in it and at some point the kid in the movie shot him with a bb gun. I remember the scene at the very end and bruce willis? Has the bb gun and aims at the kid and you here him shoot the gun and the screen goes blank and you hear the kid go ouch! I remember the scene seemed odd even as a kid watching it bc when he shot it it made the sound of a shell casing hit the ground. The only movie i found with imdb that had a kid and bruce willis (not sixth sense) was the movie """"""""North"""""""" i dont have access to that movie but im thinking thats not it. It could have been someone other than willis but i just remember his face in the scene. Thanks!	unusable			asks for two movies

I remember seeing a movie when I was younger but I can't even pinpoint a general idea on year. All I remember from it, are military people getting pulled into sand, and ending up inside some caves or something. I remember a scene where a guy was walking and then the sand started shifting in a circle pattern and then the guy starts getting dragged down. He tried to hold on and pull himself out but gets sucked in. Next scene is him falling down to the ground in a cave system. Pretty sure a whole group of them got pulled down because remember them getting into formation and holding guns in the caves.

This was game of Human chess pieces on ground. The chess piece queen has to make her decision on making her moves without sacrificing her children or children in general. Anyways, each one who is sacrificed would be taken to the back and executed one by one. You would hear gun go off then silence and back to the chess game. In the end all who was heard being shot were alive. Dont know if the Queen was being tested. Again don't remember exactly.	unusable			Short

They had a boat/ship, and suddenly there was like a pretty huge wave as the father was in the ocean, and the father swept away, and was gone, The kid now goes on an adventure finding his father. There was one scene that the kid had to go into a almost cruise ship or just a regular ship to travel somewhere.

She goes into a barn (or something of that sort) to hang herself. But as she does it, she regrets it and wants to stop, but it's too late. I feel like most of the movie is about her wishing she could have not done it, but I really don't remember. Anyone have a clue? At least I think it's a girl. Could be a guy tbh.

I dont have any pictures but i loosely remember the plot,although whenever I google it other movies pop up. The movie is about a wife who lost her memory in a car crash and is staying at her parents house because she doesnt yet feel comfortable with the husband since she doesnt remember him. Its set during Christmas time. At one point the wife sees she had a business she started from home (I think it was something she made herself like handmade products) But the husband is hesitant about showing it to her because its later found out the business completely consumed her time. At one point its revealed that the business took so much of her time that they ,,fell out of love?,, and she was actually on her way to file for divorce when the she got in the car crash. Then she realises how much of the time business stole from her and how she didnt realize how much her husband still loved her and having her around. I watched it a few years ago and loved how cliche it was haha so im hoping to find it again!

I don't remember what platform it was on but I remember a lot of the movie. I think the movie was just one word, could be two though. I'm like so sure the main actress was Zoe Perry but when searching her name nothing of that movie shows up. Anyways, she goes to her parents place where her dad is on his bed. He's old, doesn't really move and is supposedly possessed. There's a being in the movie that slowly drives everyone to kill themselves. Another scene is where the main actress is in the shower and gets jumpscared by her dad being there. The mom hangs herself, the caregiver kills themselves, and the brother kills himself in the end after the being gives him a vision that his family is dead. He almost died beforehand in some like barn. The place is also like in the middle of nowhere. This doesn't sound like much actually but any help is appreciated. Thanks!!

Not sure how accurate it is since I was undiagnosed adhd back then and a lot of memories are fused and jumbled, but I can see his face and clothing. He's wearing a white tank top with potentially a thin colared shirt on or nearby. Man looks similar to Adrien Brody. Thinner build with stubble. Can't remember what the woman looks like. I watched it on TV not in theaters. Sorry I wish I had more to go on. I think it was around the time I watched mr destiny, it was also on tv, so later than 1990. Curious if anyone else has any clue what movie it might be if it is in fact from just one movie.

Opening scene had a woman in a white dress under the control of some men, and a different group of men objected to the way she was treated. In the background was a British outpost and they got involved after the two groups of men started fighting. It has the tone of an old Western. Watching RRR now and it had a similar vibe of being outrageous and epic at the same time. Thanks for suggestions!	unsolved			
NameThatMovie	1l90tum	1	ego_death_metal	2025-06-11T20:11:29Z	this is really vague, what do you mean under the control of some men? some of these details could describe Tumbbad, which is folk horror. its a period piece paralleled with a body horror folk tale.	unsolved			
NameThatMovie	1l90tum	1_1	dori123	2025-06-11T20:22:23Z	Yes, sorry. It is vague in my memory. It seems like there were two groups of men, one had maybe 2-4 (shepherds, maybe?) and the other group was bigger, maybe a dozen? The girl was with the larger group and the smaller group debated whether to rescue her before they started. I think once they started fighting, the colonists somehow got involved.	unsolved

whatsthemoviecalled	1lbdwz0	0	Suspicious_Angle1018	2025-06-14T17:19:17Z	Disturbing film about friend group I was watching a Youtube video about disturbing movies that were more on the obscure side, so not the most common ones such as American Psycho or Silence of the lambs but more so Parents (1989) and Possession (1981). I was trying to find the YouTube video however I cannot which is kind of a bummer because I'm not the biggest fan of traditional horror but rather psychological horror as there is an element of realness to them as in it could actually happen to somebody in real life which adds a scarier element to them, however thats just my opinion. Their was another movie referenced about a group of i think highschool/college friends who end up turning on one of there female members in the group thier behaviour eventually becomes borderline abusive towards her as they basically start to tourment her. The main scene I rememeber the video describing was a metaphoric scene where the friend group tie rope around a bird representing the friend there bullying. Everytime the bird goes to fly they take it in turns to pull the bird down tormenting the bird as if so there friend. It would be a big help if anyone could help me find the movie so I can give it a watch. From my memory the film did not look new and was most likely made around the time that the others were mentioned as well. Thank you for making it this far and listening hope i somebody known the film I'm describing or youtube video it self if I'm lucky.

There was like, this ugly looking mutant being smooshy faced (I think), short (I think)guy, and his family members, and they lived together. The main mutant smooshy guy had some kind of super mind control, and controlled his other weird looking family members, I think maybe there were twins (Or just one)? that had super strength, like they all had elevated powers, but I dont remember any of the other powers/characters, but the main smooshy guy was able to control the movements of the other family members, and I believe he made them kill people or something like that. I know theres a lot of blank spaces, and tbh I dont even remember if I saw the entire thing because I fell asleep and was not signed into a tubi account while watching, but I havent been able to find it ANYWHERE, so hopefully someone may have seen this rediculous movie and might be able to point me in the right direction!

The woman forms a close bond to her husbands brother, and the relationship has a lot of sexual tension, maybe they do form a romantic relationship. Cant recall. The brother is very present in the kids lives. The husband is found to be alive. I recall the daughter not wanting to wear her chosen outfit to her dads funeral. Was played late one night on SBS. Missed the beginning.

The owner of the resort pretends that the resort is haunted the main character I'm thinking David schwimmer goes to the resort and figures out that it is impact haunted unbeknown to the owner the ghosts reenact/relive the last day of their life particularly their deaths the only line for the movie that I can remember is the main character again I think David schwimmer saying something similar to don't tup the Dead the reason why I think he says this is because he eventually falls in love with a ghost woman and through not following the advice that he somehow came across he winds up going against it and somehow the formerly ghost woman becomes alive once more. I am very certain movie came out before the year 2000, I'm thinking this movie may have come out before the 1990s however, I'm less certain of that.

Not sure if movie or TV show A small American town is suffering a series of mishaps up to and including murder. It is eventually shown to be a wild older woman committing all the crimes. There is a flashback scene or smth wherein the wild lady is shown to have gone on a night out I think but is gang raped by a bunch of guys, possibly on a car, finally they grab the future town sheriff who is basically passed out and make him assault her too while basically unconscious. So it gets revealed the men being murdered plus the sheriff investigating it were all somewhat responsible for the wild ladies' spree of crime Bonus one of the main characters a young lady is revealed to be the product of this awful event in the past.

All I can remember plot wise is that it was about a boy and a witch(??) in a fantasy world. There was some sort of machine that would create a glowing orb every time he made a wish and for every wish he lost a part of his memories. There might have been other fantasy creatures. I remember there definitely being a scene with a waterfall (maybe him jumping?) and somewhere in the movie he must have traded enough wishes to completely lose his memories, including any of his father(who was looking for him the whole time) if I remember correctly. I appreciate any potential leads because i've been DYING to watch it again to see what was going on :( Edit: Solved! It was """"""""The Neverending Story II""""""""

So I have a long memory from since I was 4, and have watched many movies and shows that I can remember scenes of but not remember names of. Over the years Ive discovered majority of them, but im stuck on 2. The first is a movie my parents found for me when i was 4-5 because it was about mermaids, but when they put it on they quickly turned it off because it was NOT kid friendly. I remember an opening sequence of a wave crashing into a pool, a mermaid going in but you dont exactly see her/it, and then it pans over runes or something on the pool tiles or like an old scroll or something, but the runes were of mermaids eating sailors and people and stuff. Ive always been curious what movie that was, and want to watch it. Second is a horror movie I watched in 2013-15 on netflix around the same time the last shift and v/h/s. It was centered around halloween time with a female as the main character, blonde, cant remember the name. There were kids doing trick or treat with burlap sacks and at some point broke in and attacked the lady, it WAS NOT THE MOVIE TRICK R TREAT I thought it was too but watched it and nope.

whatmoviewasthat	1lhi1tf	1_2_2	Exileonprioryst	2025-06-22T09:24:05Z	Mentioning the year you were born probably wasn't necessary for the second film since you gave the approximate dates when you saw it. But it would have been helpful to know the year you were born when you mentioned how old you were in the description of the first movie when you originally posted it, because nobody could estimate the time span. You wouldn't have known that I was 4 years old in 1961 if I hadn't already told you that I was 58 in 2015. People are here to help and like solving these questions, but get a bit exasperated when they can't narrow down the time frame. It's not a personal criticism of you.	unusable			
whatmoviewasthat	1lhi1tf	1_2_1_1_1	barsteward1	2025-06-22T09:36:31Z	If we know how old you were and when you watched something it helps narrow the timescale down, since you specify neither that gives us a span of pretty much 80- 100 years to work from.

whatisthatmovie	1lgq5k8	1_1	vineethgk	2025-06-22T07:08:27Z	Thank you for the reply. I was taking a look at the movie in Youtube. But no, 'Army of Darkness' doesn't seem to be the one. The problem here is that have only a vague recollection of the ending scenes from the film and that is all I managed to see from the whole movie. My dad and elder sis were watching this in the middle of the night (apparently I was considered too young then to stay up till midnight and watch these stuff! :D ) and I happened to catch the ending of it when I got up to go to the loo. An extra detail I might add is that the sorceress (or the lady who seemed to be a sorceress) was wearing something in the shape of a swimsuit or monokini in that scene. And I also remember that the monster creature was inside a pit (and the people who were sacrificed were thrown into its mouth, I think). The protagonists throw a bomb or something into its open mouth to kill it. I guess these available clues are too few and too vague to identify the movie. But thank you for your suggestion!

Very different than the dude she wore a dress like a normalish dress with like some small pattern on it. The big thing was that she seemed extremely uncomfortable and the dude kept grabbing her crotch and it seemed like not in a malicious way he seemed very casual just talking while he did it. It cut to them at a motel which looked really rundown etc. I think he asked for a single room but Im not sure. This movie or tv show was filmed fairly recently from the looks of it but set in an older time maybe like 50s 70s possibly 80s although it could be different I just thought that might be the case.

NameThatMovie	1kprx5l	0	NeedleworkerMuch1778	2025-05-18T19:16:03Z	Please help me find this movie. I'm on a mission to track down a movie that's been living in the dusty corners of my childhood memories, and I'm hoping someone here can help me piece it together. Here are the details I remember: * The movie kicks off with a radio broadcast urgently telling people to evacuate Earth due to an impending disaster. * The main setting involves a small group, maybe around five people, aboard a transport spaceship in a really desolate, unwelcoming part of space. * Things get really strange when deceased relatives start appearing to the crew members. I specifically remember these entities taking the forms of their loved ones  a mother, a dog, and a grandmother are the ones that stick out. * I saw this when I was very young, so my memory is super fuzzy on a lot of the specifics. Here are some more details that might jog someone's memory: * There's a scene that really freaked me out as a kid: one of the characters on the spaceship, who I think was thin, saw the being that looked like his mother actually change form. This really traumatized him. * I recall a Black actor whose dog appeared to him as one of these visitations. * A key setting in the movie was a very cold, exterior environment. I remember the characters having to wear thick thermal parkas whenever they left the spacecraft. * For some reason, I have a strong feeling that this was a television movie, not something released in theaters. * I'm guessing it aired sometime between 1979 and 1986. This has been bugging me for years! Any ideas or suggestions would be incredibly appreciated. Let me know if any of these details ring a bell for you! Thanks in advance for your help!	unsolved

Main character was a boy, 10-14 by my best guess. I think he was blond. For some reason that I can't recall he's part of this treasure hunt with this guy who has a servant (or slave?) who is a black man that is apparently illiterate and is also either dead, mute or both. The treasure hunter trusts this character because he can't read the clues to where the treasure is or communicate with other characters. In the end this illiterate character can actually read and the child realizes it when he sees that the character has betrayed the main character and murdered him or been murdered by him. Someone was definitely murdered. Don't remember who. I also think there was something to do with a goat and a pun about a kid being a baby goat, but I might be conflating two different treasure hunting movies.	unusable			part of ABC Weekend Specials

The culprit was a woman who was kidnapping kids and burying them (alive?) in some forest where her son who i think died in some tragic accident was also buried, so that he wouldn't be alone.

So I snuck a peek to see what all the noise from the tv was&all I remember is something about a woman getting kidnapped and shes either in a wedding dress when shes kidnapped or the kidnapper was forcing her to marry him, and he was forcing her to wear lipstick and he thought it would be funny to try the lipstick to coax her into wearing it?

Don't ask me why, but this episode (considered one of - if not - the worst Columbo offerings) is etched in my brain. I could not find a decent trailer or it free anywhere, but if you have Peacock, I think all the Columbo episodes are on there. I found this [EPISODE SYNOPSIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1D9wtDxBM), which shows plenty of clips that should jog your memory. It doesn't include the specific """"""""lipstick"""""""" scene you described, so I found [THIS SCREENSHOT](https://i0.wp.com/columbophile.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Time-lipstick-1.jpg?ssl=1) on another site.	unusable

It's an animated movie I'm pretty sure. Saw it when I was a kid, so around the 2000s and early 2010s. It's somewhat realistic, yet very colorful. I watched it in french but can't say if it was the original language. It's first set in a modern city. I remember the protagonist being a girl, she got/found a little dog that she takes with her. The dog gets kidnapped (in an appartment high up a luxurious tower by night ? I think ?). From then I don't remember anything clearly. She finds herself on a green ocean (on a boat ?). And then somehow find out the dog is a prince ? He's being held up in a cage, guarded by a man (or cyclop) that can see the eyes closed, and is blind when the eyes opened Near the end, I think there is a greenhouse with malevolent sentient plants. I'd be very happy if anyone here could tell me this wasn't just a dream and that this movie actually exist. Many thanks

I was maybe 8 years old, with my older brothers and sisters, one holidays we had fun, and watched the movie from TV with commercial breaks, and I don't remember actors well, movie probably from the 2000s USA. It takes place in the summer. The main characters are a skinny young guy with a dark hair and no beard, he and a group of friends (girls and guys) go out of town, drink in a bar, then they meet another group of people, they play a game with them on the lake where they try to push each other into the water while sitting on their friends' shoulders, where one girl pulls out a tuft of hair on his head while trying to push him into the water, and laughs at it. Then they are in a country house of some adult man, this man will have a pregnant woman in the room, by the end of the film she will give some horrible birth in the hallway. Then by the end of the film this man will start killing this group of friends, but then the main character wakes up in a bar and everything that happened was not real, all his friends are alive. I'm not native eng speaker but I did everything I could. Now I'm 28 yo and never in my life did I see even blink of this movie ever again.

This was probably around 20062008, but the movie itself was likely from the early 2000s. My parents never let me finish the movie after that scene  it was kind of disturbing  but it stuck with me for the rest of my life.

I saw this as a little girl and it might be a TV movie - 90s or late 80s. Theres this woman with two husbands who dont know about each other. One is more stuck up and fancy and when she is with him she always has her hair up. The other one is more the artist type I think and he has a beard. At some point she is set to receive some type of award. SPOILERS. She goes to the ceremony and the husband who wasnt supposed to make it is actually there and the two husbands finally see each other and the situation is exposed. At the end of the movie she ends up with the stuck up one but she realizes that he is not that rigid after all and she starts wearing her hair down with him. Please help me find this!

I believe it was either British or American. In the movie, a mysterious man arrives in a small town and gives out small objectslike beads or stonesto the local children. Each child picks one randomly. If a child picks a black bead, the man takes that child away with him. The child never returns. It's implied that the man is taking the child to train or raise them to be like him, but the film doesn't explain much detail about this. The tone was mysterious and a bit fantastical, but not sci-fi or horror. The black bead seemed to symbolize being """"""""chosen."""""""" The children were not harmed.

I was 7 or 8 i guess, so the movie was from 1987-1988, maybe earlier. From what i remember it was a noir-style movie, with thick, oppressing atmosphere. Clearly not something i'd recommend a 7-year-old to watch. Set in the US in 40s? 50s? I do not remember a plot, just the guy (detective?) looking for someone. At some point he was interacting with the Devil (or a guy i interpreted as the Devil), and i believe that Devil guy had long sharp fingernails. Not much, i understand, but maybe?..

I remember part of the plot, but I may have combined two different movies in my head. There was an old man, a detective, maybe he was retired. He was trying to solve a missing person case, maybe a teenager, but nothing worked. In his investigation, he visited a diner where the owner was, or just an employee, and he just had lunch there. The case could not be solved and he abandoned it, or some time simply passed. After 3 years (I have doubts about this detail, because it seems like it could have been in another movie) he returns to this city and in the same diner solves this missing person case, maybe he found out that the whole city was involved. I dug through a bunch of movie collections, checked my old correspondence and sites where I searched for movies, but I found nothing. The only thing that matches the vibe of this movie is Girl in the Fog, it has a very similar shooting and initially I thought it was the same movie, but it didn't have the detail with the diner.

I''m trying to find a movie I watched sometime between 2010 and 2015. It's a live-action film, definitely not horror, but more of a sci-fi or fantasy with suspense. The main character is a girl, around 10 years old, who leads a group of friends. They ride their bikes a lot, and one of the boys in the group has a stutter. The central plot involves the adults in their town starting to act like children due to water contamination. It gets pretty chaotic, and I specifically remember the local hospital transforming into something like a nursery to handle all the regressed adults. I remember watching it on Netflix at some point, but it's probably been removed by now. I think it might be an independent or not-very-well-known film. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

I don't remember exactly if he writes, but he is curious about other people's lives. Scenes I remember 1. In one scene he's in a cafe I think and a thief sits next to him asking him what he does. 2. Ok I remember this thief wears gloves, not leather ones, but white latex ones. 3. He invites the protagonist to enter other people's homes, not exactly to steal, but to observe other people's lives. 4. This thief breaks into a woman's house and finds a pair of earrings and steals them, but ONLY one, just to annoy her. 5. The thief tells the protagonist that he found a new house to break into, this house is the protagonist's house but he acts like is not his house. Basically in this scene the thief makes fun of this guy's lifestyle. 6. Almost at the end of the film, the thief tells the protagonist to rob a place, but in the end it was all a scam.				name of OP deleted

The movie must have been mid 80s to early 90s based on memory of production. The main character was a little boy in a medieval fantasy world. He was the son of some rich or noble man (maybe king) who gives him a little clay man as a gift/pet. the little guy was a tannish orange color and had a face sort of like the not the momma baby from Dinosaurs. The plot is lost to me now but I remember when the little guy got wet (or maybe its when he drank) he would grow to the size of a kaiju and start destroying little villages and taverns. I think his size depended on how much liquid hed absorbed and he would slowly seep the liquid as he got smaller. I believe at the end of the movie the little guy as a kaiju thinks he killed the boy and then weeps causing him to shrink rapidly and somehow save the boy (I unironically might be imagining that part) I can recall a specific scene where the evil-doers either accidentally pour wine from a barrel onto the little guy or think its a good idea to hide and transport the little guy in a nearly full barrel causing him to erupt out the top of the building. I wish i had more details to give but i can really only remember flashes of imagery without any narrative context. If anyone can help me find this i would be greatly appreciative and if i can provide any clarifications or extra info. please let me know.

Because of this injury, she becomes disabled. The other sister tries to save her. The movie focuses on their relationship, the struggle, and the emotional journey.

I'm looking for a movie about a woman who is afraid of flying because she had an accident as a child and then she gets on a plane and strange things happen. The ending is that she is still the girl on the plane and everything that had happened until now was a vision to save herself. Thanks.

The guy steals a truck with a little carousel in the back, the kind on a sidewalk outside a store. Mom gets in bed of truck, but she keeps getting slammed into the truck window, stuck between the window and the carousel. It's probably the saddest yet most honest rescue attempt ever.... What was this movie???! Pretty sure this would've been after 1994, if that helps.

I would say 25 to 30 years ago I watched a martial arts film on VHS that was either dubbed or subtitled with a childhood friend. There is a scene where one of the fighters stops during the fight and holds his arm out with his forearm pointed in the air and his other forearm perpendicular to the ground, and then switch his arms with his pose. It was really funny and we laugh about it all these years later; however, we cannot remember the name of the movie. The fighting scene took place indoors I believe, and the fighter was wearing a conical Asian hat (aka rice or Cooley hat). I had a chatGTP render a picture of a fighter doing the first part of the pose. Its not exact, but its certainly better than anything I could have drawn. Again, I know this is a very long shot, but if anybody knows what this movie is, you would be solving a decades long mystery and inside joke between two friends.	unsolved

We think its horror, or horror-adjacent. He distinctly remembers that it starts with a truck driving through a field. The most vivid thing he could describe is a scene where two friends go out to shoot a new gun one of them just bought, at a lone tree. One of the men goes to line up bottles or cans for target practice, and when he turns around, the other man is aiming the gun at him and shoots him. My brother thinks there may have been a love triangle with these two and a woman he describes as manipulative and a ho, and thats why the one killed the other. Any help would be appreciated! Its driving him nuts and we cant find anything on Google.

I also remember a giant hole in the floor and when a few people went into it, it was like thousands of tunnels like a giant ant colony filled with the aliens. I don't remember anything else but that.

But when I was little me and my family would occasionally watch this movie with a main character who looked like the main character of Max Keeble, and I'm pretty sure the movie came out around the same time. The problem is, I don't think it was the same actor. Maybe just another white kid with spiky hair. The plot is him being told by this government agency that they need him to go undercover so they train him to be a spy and find out he can't talk to girls, even though the whole mission was for him to get an invite to a girl's birthday party. Spy agency adults train this kid how to talk to a girl his age, he manages to get an invite from her on his own- in that scene the female adult who's been training him suddenly walks in pretending to be the doctor and just noticing she has a birthday coming up and asking her to invite him. So she can awkwardly respond that she just did. I forget what happens at the party or how it ends, I think the birthday girl's dad turns out to be the villain or something?

It ended on a cliffhanger and has bothered me for years. In the early 2000s I think, I saw a movie or miniseries where a woman hit a child with her car (white suv maybe?), killed her, and fled the scene. The woman driving was a Caucasian brunette and knew the child she killed. She tried to go about business as usual while the investigation was ongoing, while keeping an ear to the ground. She played dumb with her family and later a friend, who shared some rumors she heard about the investigation. Somehow, she obtained a piece of jewelry, belonging to said friend (gold earring maybe?) and pocketed it. Later, a detective (a Black pregnant woman) approaches the woman who committed the hit and run for what seems like a friendly chat. She tells her everyone assumes the driver was a real bitch, but she thinks the driver probably got scared. Our villain still plays dumb. After that, we see the detective at home with her husband, chatting about the investigation. She tells him she knows who killed the child, but doesnt have enough proof. She says she knows the woman made a mistake, but as she is about to become a parent, the case has affected her personally and part of her wants the woman to suffer. She asks if that makes her terrible and he says I dont know. We then see the driver at the scene of the crime. She has snuck past the crime scene tape and is sobbing. She throws the jewelry into the nearby woods, framing her friend. There was a to be continued placard and&thats it. I never saw the rest. Anyone know what Im talking about? Anyone know what happened? Im pretty sure the accents were American, but feel like I saw it abroad.

It was probably a school bus I don't know how much of it is coherent or related to each other, I may be mixing elements from different movies, but I'm almost sure there was something about a man retrieving a container/chest or something like that from underwater and two ghosts ladies helping him out

It was shown sometime between 2000 and 2004 on Premiere, which was a subscription-based TV service here in Germany, similar to Netflix nowadays. Heres what I remember about the film: Two people get kidnapped. I'm not exactly sure, but I think they were two men  one a bit older, the other probably in his 20s or 30s. Im also not sure if the kidnapper was acting alone. They travel around the country in a van  possibly in the U.S. At some point, they end up in what looks like a motel, but I think the room they stay in is more like a cabin. Somehow, they manage to tie the kidnapper to a chair and inject him with a drug cocktail, trying to kill him  but he survives. Ive already asked ChatGPT, but none of the suggestions matched. So Im hoping someone here might recognize the movie. Thanks in advance!

From what I can remember the movie starts with these 4 teens vandalizing a car and running away from the cops to an old building, i have a vague memory of the other scenes but I also remember a sex scene between a black girl and a blonde guy, and one where they're being chased and the blonde dude hides his girl behind a door using a cabinet.

I could have sworn it was called something like, """"""""there was no war in..(something)"""""""". General plot: US soldier was on a military base, i think it was either the """"""""end"""""""" of the vietnam or korean war. He had a girlfriend he promised to take back with him. He was ordered to evacuate, and didn't have time to get her (or something) She def a baby. She had a shitty life, working as a stripper and/or other adult work to support herself. I can't recall if it was his baby, or as a byproduct of above work. He comes back to rescue her, but she's either dying or already dead. He takes the baby home, with his american wife. He got married after the war, and felt gulty? honestly that whole part is a bit fuzzy in my head.				musical premiere in 1989 - not sure about publication date

The basic premise is as follows: Late 60s-mid 70s era movie/tv movie Countdown clock to d-day/doomsday Large screen viewing - I believe the machine itself was tube in shape and most of the set was beige/off white along with the machine The central theme is that the USA has made a time machine and can see the future, by doing so, word gets out eventually, leading to an increasing state of confrontation with the USSR/China etc. The whole thing escalates until they nuke each other. What happens is that, by seeing the future that has a nuclear war, they cause the nuclear war. This movie came to mind, as I just watched """"""""Paycheck"""""""" with Ben Affleck and it's pretty much a copy of the central idea of this. It may be an episode of a TV anthology style show, but I was so sure it's an old movie. Any help would be greatly appreciated.	unusable			TV show

Sometime in the 1990s, I was about to leave an old friends house (person unreachable, so I cant ask her). And about 10 minutes before I left, she put a movie into the VHS/DVD player. I remember seeing this scene which was either the intro to the movie or possibly a trailer. It was a relatively short abstract/seemingly animated scene where a real (non animated) head was shown being cut open at the top (full top of scalp), and pulled off exposing the brain. Then a voice came on saying the name of the movie as the movie title was splashed on the screen in an almost comical/whimsical font. Heres the kicker. My mind wants to remember it as the 1991 horror film Popcorn, BUT I have watched the movie and watched every trailer I can find on YouTube, and none of them show this brain scene Im remembering. So I wonder if Popcorn is even the correct film. Can anyone remember this? Edit: This could have been an 80s thing for all I know.

Might have been an independent film, might have even been a Sci-Fi original or part of one of their themed movie weekenda (man I miss those). I stumbled across it again just a few years ago but now I want to watch it again and I can't remember it. I can remember two or three scenes. #1 There are 2 guys outdoors, possibly hunters, who see the zombies coming toward them. I THINK one of them realizes they are zombies, but his friend says something to the effect of 'I don't care if they're the Swedish bikini team!"""""""" #2 the zombies attack the local church and I can remember them crawling over and out from underneath the pews. #3 the climax / very end of the movie. One of the groups of people we've been following is going to make their escape. I think they are a family of Preppers. There's a little girl say 10 years old or so with blood on her armed with a rifle or a shotgun who comes up to one of the guys in the house and says the zombies are trying to break through the basement. They eventually escape and get in the car with the girl in the passenger seat, she says she needs to get something to eat and the driver tells her she has to wait and squeezes her hand, but then she says """"""""but I'm hungry now"""""""" and bites his hand, revealing that she had turned as the credits roll.

The movie was about 2 colored guys, and they found some insane weed. They went to smoke it, but when they did they got so high they started floating towards the air. At some point other people in town also got the weed, and then there was a scene with a view from the sky with all those people also floating upwards. its vague, but can anyone help me find this movie :"""""""")	unusable			comment with solution was deleted

Starts off with a man meeting a woman at her home in the Wild West. They have a short affair, and he runs off, being chased by some men. He manages to lose them by swapping clothes with a dead man. The woman believes him dead. She writes a story (or tells it to someone who writes it), about her great love. This story becomes massively popular. Even people who know the man, believe this tale to be the truth. A year or so later, the man who is unaware of this major story about himself, tries to meet up with his old friends.

At the end a vampire wants to take a child to raise as his own, he wears all black, has a cane and has long grey hair. They draw marbles to determine who has to give their child to him and i believe the main character draws the black marble, then it cuts forward to the future when they spot him and the child, now grown up faces the camera to reveal he is now a vampire too.	unusable			TV show

whatmoviewasthat	1l3vc3m	0	pesdevidro	2025-06-05T10:01:19Z	Movie about a golden dragon woman When I was a kid, about 10 years ago, I watched a movie on Fox/HBO/something like that (I don't exactly remember it) about a medieval kingdom that was fighting with other kingdoms or cursed. I'm not very sure about that, but I always remember that in that kingdom there was a golden dragon that turned into a golden woman to seduce the king or his son. They eventually have the deed and after that the king's army fights with that golden dragon and kills her by attacking a gem in her neck. My memory of the movie is pretty blurry since I watched it so many years ago and at the time was a kid. To me that movie was 3D animarion with pretty good CGI and a hyper realistic look, but I could be wrong and it could have been live action. If anyone can help me, I would greatly appreciate it since I am looking for that movie's name for years now.

A movie scene was playing the other day and I wanted to know what it was called, if anyone knows. There was a blonde assassin (very stereotypical femme fatale I think) with a pixie cut and smeared black makeup. She was essentially wearing a pink bikini top and a very short pink skirt or shorts (Im not sure I didnt see very well). She was shooting at police with two guns and then got into a car with a guy who kinda looked like Woody Harrelson (he might not look like him at all though, I suck at faces). They then got into a car chase with the police. I thinks she licked the guys face at some point (she seems like a typical unhinged assassin thats common in action movies). I think there was also a couple whose son is missing? They were at a pool and were arguing cause the dad got a gift and the mom said that was his hobby last year and that now he plays football. Im pretty sure the movie was set in the USA, and I think that the actors were American (but Im terrible at accents and it was not very loud so I cant be sure). Does anyone recognize this? I was just curious what movie it is, and if really appreciate it if anyone knows. Edit: it was Transporter 2! Thank you everyone!

whatmoviewasthat	1l5cwol	0	Desperate_Surround28	2025-06-07T05:04:24Z	Movie about a woman interviewing an unseen presence in an abandoned building. I only saw the beginning: a young woman (caucasian, blonde or maybe dirty-blonde hair) walks across what looks like an outdoor industrial area or maybe old abandoned train track leading to warehouses or an old factory, something like that. She enters the abandoned building/factory/whatever and maybe sets down her purse and cell phone (or maybe not). It is daytime. She starts talking to the air like she already knows something is there (I don't recall seeing any other people in the beginning of this movie). Something answers after several querries and it feels like she is coming back to continue a conversation they had recently -- she knew it was there already and has a set of questions ready to ask it. If memory serves, she asks questions about its nature, and sometimes it gives concise answers and sometimes it just doesn't respond. I remember getting the impression it was very, very old and possibly no human or was something pre-human and that it was bound to that spot (I got the impression it was the spot of earth the building was on, not the building itself). That's as far as a got as I had other tasks to complete. This just happened to be the next thing to come while I was using the TV as background noise back like 5-10 years ago -- I got sucked into the beginning but had tasks to complete so I made a mental note that I needed to check this out later. I was intesely curious to know the backstory of this entity/presence and why she knew it was there, and what the rest of her questions were and its answers. Cut to: 5-10 years and a few days ago I saw a reference to this film on some show (again, background noise, I don't remember the show) and this memory flooded back: I had to watch the whole of this film. It started making me restless -- last few days are using refining AI querries to narrow it down and I get no hits even close (though I did discover many new headscratcher films i never knew about, which was good), so I've exhausted the AIs I have access to. I cannot rest until I watch this film. I'm at my wit's end. ADDENDUM: I should have included this originally: List of movie that are NOT it: * **A Ghost Story (2017)** * **Manifesto (2017)** * **Relic (2020)** * **Hereditary (2018)** * **The Endless (2017)** * **The House That Jack Built (2018)** * **Come True (2020)** * **Hanna (2011)** * **The Taking of Deborah Logan** * **The Entity (1982)** * **The Ritual (2017)** * **No One Gets Out Alive (2021)** * **Annihilation (2018)** * **Starfish (2018)** My AI searches over days turned up serveral hundred movies that were not it: that's waay to long to expet people to read, so I kept it short and narrowed down to what I think are what people will try to commonly guess is the movie I am searching for.

The storm that's coming seems to be a background factor until it gets closer and closer, ultimately leading to the final showdown happening while some bad guys are trying to kill the protagonist for not having the money he owes them... or something like that? He has like 48 hours to get the money but he doesn't have it so he tries to run out of town, but then he runs back to get some girl or something but that's right when the storm has finally hit.

This would've been sometime in the early to mid 80s. All I remember is a little girl is playing on the roof of the family house, and she falls off. Simultaneously, the mother is in the kitchen holding a watermelon and she accidentally drops it and it splatters on the floor. Quite symbolic. The little girl died. Shortly after, her sibling, I think it was a little boy, is in bed in the dark, and a ghostly shadow figure of the little girl who died emerges at the foot of the bed. It still gives me goosebumps. Anybody have any idea what the film is called?

Hello, I was recently flipping through some DVDs that were for sale at my local library, there was one I was going to buy but I didn't have cash on me. I went back a few days later, but someone else had purchased it. I believe it was post 2015, it seemed like an indie movie, I remember the cover had a lot of blue tones. The premise from what I remember was a man was hitchhiking to meet up with a woman who he was pen-pals with. The woman had recently been released from jail/prison. The man who picks up the hitchhiker decides to steal his identity so he can meet the woman instead. It is possible I flipped the characters and the man picked up a hitchhiker who then steals his identity. I tried asking Google about this and it couldn't find what I was looking for since I didn't have much specific information. I didn't recognize any of the actors names, it felt like an indie/B movie.

Maybe my searching skills arent good enough. I am looking for the name of a movie that is probably at least a couple decades old. Possibly 1980s to 2000s. I recall the movie as being in an urban school setting. The main character was a young adult male. I have the impression he was a teacher or substitute. He believed he was a battle droid built by a brilliant inventor. I recall two scenes. In the first scene, a group of violent male teens is in a car. The main character stealthily hooks a chain to a car door handle, crawls under the car, hooks the other end of the chain to the car door on the other side, then stands up and tosses a grenade in the open car window, and walks off as the car explodes. In the second scene that I recall, another man notices a bleeding scratch on the main characters neck, and realizes/deduces the main character is not a battle droid, but rather the brilliant inventors biological son. Thats how I recall it, but its been a long time.

I saw it when I was a kid, and now Im 30 and seriously losing my mind trying to remember what it was. Heres what I remember: A group of teens go on a trip  I think they take a boat to some forest-y hotel or camp type place. The owners of the hotel are a married couple, and they start killing off the group. One of the girls in the group is super quiet, has braided hair like Wednesday Addams, and turns out shes working with the killers. Theres also this one woman in the group with amazing boobs  no other way to put it. Shes having sex with her boyfriend, and mid-hookup, the killers attack and kill him. Her whole body gets covered in blood. If I remember right, that same woman survives and ends up killing the murderers at the end. Please help me figure out what this movie is.

In one of the first scenes, a guy is having sex with his girlfriend. As part of their sex play, she gives him a gun. He pulls the trigger thinking its empty, but it goes off and he shoots her in the head, killing her. He panics and doesnt know what to do with the body, so he keeps it in the house. Afterward, paranormal things start happening. I specifically remember: * The entire movie mostly takes place inside the guys house. * In one creepy scene, hes exhausted and lies down near the corpse and the corpses hand starts stroking his head, causing him to jolt awake, only to find that the corpse didn't actually move. * In another scene, someone else enters the house to do a wellness check on him since he hasn't left his home in days. The person enters the room where the corpse should be but the body has disappeared. When the person leaves, the corpse suddenly reappears. It was in English and had a very eerie vibe but not over-the-top gore, but psychological and supernatural horror. I think they tried to keep it open ended about whether the guy was going insane and hallucinating or if the paranormal stuff was really happening. Don't remember the ending at all. Does anyone know what this movie is?

whatisthatmovie	1koz4oe	0	fuzzy-_-dunlop	2025-05-17T18:01:20Z	Im looking for a movie I watched around 1991. Probably Cinemax very late night. It was French I believe. Subtitles in English. It was a bank robbery gone bad with hostages. There was the most disgusting joke in it. I was 12 or 13 years old and Ive remembered this joke this long. A sailer comes back from a long voyage and upon landing in Paris goes to a whore house. He asks the madam in charge for the ugliest fattest whore she has. She escorts him up to a room and he sees in the bed the fattest ugliest woman hes seen. He gets in bed and tells her he wants to eat he bellybutton out, its his fetish. So he gets in position and starts to eat it out running his face in it and he feels something in his teeth, he paused and pulled a bit of meat out of his teeth, he thinks nothing and resumes, going to town again he felt something again in his teeth and it was a piece of corn. At that point it was too much. He screams Im going to be sick. The whore shrugs and says thats what the last guy said too. Ive never forgotten the joke. It was violent. And I was too young to watch it Im sure. No other real clues. Im sure I mangled the joke. It may have been as early as 1989 but I think it was 1991. Ive searched and can not find this movie.

It was a kids movie, and may have been a remake or at least inspired by Mr. Bug Goes to Town. I very randomly was reminded of a movie I had found it on amazon a while back, and now Im searching for an answer, because I cant find proof it exists anymore. Heres what I remember: Edit: It is definitely not any of the Maya the Bee films. I think that the story may have described itself as being based off of a fable? \- I think the movie poster had a bee and grasshopper sitting on a flower or something similar at night time and the cgi for the movie was pretty decent. Definitely a step above from some really low effort kids movies. \- From what I can recall from the plot, there were around three main characters, who were: a kind queen bee, a little girl bee, and a grasshopper. They lived in a small hive town in the grass, there was probably a villain, and I think the grasshopper was poor and maybe played a fiddle. At the very end of the story, the little girl bee takes the queens place, and the former queen lives happily ever after with the grasshopper. Thanks for any help on this.	unsolved

I remember it very vaguely so the details probably are not exact. It has to have been made some time between 2010 and. It almost had a Legend of Zelda (the new one) kind of feel. There is this man who is in this video game like world (No, it's not Free Guy or Ready Player One) and he meets this girl who he then has a kid with. They are all very happy until one day the kid gets kidnapped (maybe the wife too I can't remember). He goes on a journey to get them back and picks up some help (I don't remember exactly if it was mystical creatures or real people but I'm very certain that it had a mystical creature element). He brings them all together to fight this man who has his son (and possibly wife) and when he finds him and they go to war, the guy has all these magical powers and says he is some kind of hacker. He is keeping the son in a floating yellowish orb. He finally gets close to defeating the """"""""hacker"""""""" guy but then the hacker dude freezes time and everything goes black and white. Everything is frozen except the main dude and the hacker guy. The hacker guy tries to tell him none of it is real and I'm pretty sure that the hacker guy lets him win and as the main character is about to touch his son, there is a flash of light and he wakes up in this tank like thing and gets out and he is just at this video game fair thing testing the newest tech. It was very emotional for him because he had just gone through a life where he met the love of his life and had a son, but now he must face the fact that none of it was real. Edit: I did find the movie thanks to user [jnires](https://www.reddit.com/user/jnires/). The movie is Dragon Quest you story. My memory of the movie was a bit off but I did find it.

Heres what I remember: * The movie starts with a guy holding a shotgun and knocking on the door of a house full of gangsters. When someone inside peeks through the peephole, the guy shoots him straight through it. Very intense opening. * The main characters were either two or three friends. One of them was a tall, bald guy who didnt speak or said very little. He was the intimidating, silent type. * Theres a scene where two cops are parked on a highway. One of them starts to turn on the siren, but the other stops him because they realise the cars going by are filled with gangsters, and the cops are scared to get involved. Its clear that these gangsters run the road. * Theres also a memorable scene where a group of gangster girls shows up, and the main characters end up fighting them with guns. * The film has a gritty, violent, and intense vibe. Im pretty sure it was in English and likely American-made, maybe a crime or action movie. * At the end of the movie, the bald guy who barely spoke gets sent to prison. After a time skip, hes bailed out, and thats when the movie ends. I watched it sometime between 20122015, but it could be older than that.

There were things reappearing or dissappearing (i cant remember which) from her ceiling the longer she stayed, and she had this cook bringing her cookies and milk almost everyday which she only discovered who made the cookies and brought the milk later on. It was a live action movie and didn't have any horror aspects! Not that i can remember. I think they were in a forest of some kind as well and there were other characters.

Unfortunately, the school bus arrived, so I couldnt finish it. The movie was about a group of friends who decided to live on a remote island, possibly somewhere in Asia, along with some other people. They had to take a boat to the city every once in a while to get supplies. I also remember a scene where they had a tattoo or some kind of mark on their arms.

I was doom scrolling one night and I saw a clip of this movie (pretty sure it was a movie anyway) so here was the scene to my memory: Live action Some peasant (or knight of a different army I couldn't tell) was begging this other knight (who was a douche) not to kill a bunch of people, and the the knight was still wanting to kill them. I forgot how it got to this point but they agreed to duel each other or something like that, and the douche couldn't stand in the slippery mud, so instead of fighting him the good knight/possible peasant guy just kinda stabbed his sword in the ground and let the other peasant kill the guy while he was slipping in the mud. (Pretty sure it was also raining but I could be wrong) This was a few weeks ago, so I'm afraid that is all I can give info wise

I started to watch and old comedy type film looked kinda like an indie, quirky film the other month maybe April and fell asleep and now it's nowhere to be found on the streaming channels and it's driving me crazy it was removed. The cover art was off white and red ( i believe title was red) with i think people on it. I remember a mean lady who everyone hated and her husband who has like blondish hair has an affair with another women who i believe is a waitress. Then i think she dies or maybe a brother did i can't remember. There is also a scene with someone's pick up truck and the guy is either weird or has a mental disability. I can't remember i was so tired. It looked like it took place maybe before the 70's but it's filmed in the 80's or maybe early 90's. Had some famous actors in it. It is not one of the really common films we see on repeats on TV. What is this movie called possibly so I can finish watching it?

Context: i was very young (before teenager years) and i wasnt allowed to watch full on horror movies like Saw etc nor i liked it, but my parents one night were watching a movie while i was in my room and i sneak on them and only was able to hear the sound (dialogues etc) and this line was stuck on me. Now that im an adult i need to watch it to maybe untraumatize myself now that i will have full context of the scene lol. Line: """"""""please i am awake, i dont have anesthesia. You going to kill me....nooooo!"""""""" Something like this and the person (man) dies while being operated (maybe , or tortured idk, idk the full context). Also the person doing this to the person begging isnt listening or refusing to listening to their voice. I also think i heard drill and surgery noises. Tldr: someone begging to the (surgeon?) that they feel everything that they will do to them and to stop because they arent with anesthesia but the surgeon (or not surgeon idk) continues and he dies screaming and sounds of drilling or operation idk.	unsolved

Like the 2010's. It's about a man who has a disabled (idk) and neurodivergent brother. One day this man has to go out, so he hires a nurse nanny. The nanny let the brother watching a static image on the tv. Then, a weird show starts. Like a horror circus kind. Where a humanoid pig butcher with barbed wire all around his body that tells the neurodivergent brother to kill the nurse and he does. I'm from Mexico and I'm pretty sure I've watched on a famous horror movie channel called Panico. But I already looked up for it in a web with all of their movies during the years and I didn't find it

A group of people are hiding in a cellar, sewer; they are trying to escape the Nazis during the Warsaw appraising. A baby starts to cry and a fighter/soldier offers to help the exhausted mother. She hands him the baby and after a few minutes he stops crying. When he hands the baby back, the mother discovers the baby has been smothered. This has been driving me crazy for YEARS!

Looking for a movie that I saw in the late 90s / early 2000s (no later than 2004 probably, I remember watching it in our old house) with Rufus Sewell or someone who looks like him tripping and totally biting it. I think it was a comedy? It certainly was to me and the friend who rewound the scene a hundred times to laugh. I think he was walking quickly after someone. I have a vague idea that the setting is a vineyard or a club or estate, and the plot has something to do with wine? I say Rupert Sewell because I distinctly remember his slight difference in eye size, but possibly conflating the things. I cant find anything when I search so some of the details above MUST be wrong. Any ideas? Edit: Rupert to Rufus

Please help me find the title, I've been looking for this movie for years. Solved: it was Arlington Road! Theres a movie that keeps popping into my mind from time to time, but Ive never been able to identify it. I've searched on Google, asked ChatGPT, and even browsed the full filmography of an actor I suspect might be in it, still nothing. This is probably the first time Im asking on Reddit, and Im really hoping someone here recognizes it. I remember watching this film on TV with my mother, and even she has no memory of it, which is starting to make it feel like some sort of fever dream. I must have been between 7 and 11 years old, so I likely saw it between 1997 and 2001. It aired in prime time on an Italian TV channel (if any Italians are reading, Im talking about *Canale 5*). I *think* the movie might be American, but Im not completely sure. Theres a scene that made me think it was from the US, Ill explain below. Heres what I remember: The film opens with a young boy running down the street. He isnt shown clearly at first, I believe at one point only his shoes are visible as he runs. Eventually, the camera shows the boys hand, badly injured by a firecracker, held tightly to his chest. From this point, my memory is hazy. I believe hes helped by his fathers new neighbor. The mother is nowhere to be seen. I dont know if the boy is motherless or if she's just not part of the story, but the father starts getting to know this new neighbor. I have a vague memory of the actor playing the neighbor. I think it might have been **Philip Seymour Hoffman**, but after checking his filmography I didnt find anything that matches. Maybe it was someone who looked like him? In any case, at some point, the boys father begins to feel suspicious about the neighbor and starts investigating him. Theres one scene I clearly remember: the father goes to what looks like a library or archive, where he reads old newspapers on a screen. We dont really have anything like that in Italy, and Ive only seen those kinds of setups in American movies, thats what makes me think this might be a US film. I also remember the ending pretty clearly. Eventually, the father realizes the neighbor is a fugitive serial killer. The father tries to escape by car (cant remember if the son is with him or not). But once hes in the car, it explodes. I believe the explosion is shown from a distance, maybe even from the neighbors point of view as he watches. I think thats actually how the film ends. Does any of this ring a bell for anyone? I know the description is a bit patchy, but Id really appreciate any help.

The movie was gory as hell, shows people getting their guts eaten on the front lawn of houses and I think it takes place mainly at night. One scene I remember vividly was where the main character (a girl) was escaping zombies and when into a house where one of her school mates live and the dad threatens her with an Axe and she gets placed downstairs where she find the mom chained to the bed in a laying position and shes a zombie, later on the son (her school mate) feels bad and releases her but then the mom breaks free somehow and eats the son and the camera shows it. The main character freaks out and escapes. The film takes place in a small town in America and shows how the infection flies through the town and the main characters experience with it. It is definitely a indie film and is definitely no longer on Netflix.	unsolved

whatsthemoviecalled	1l69mek	0	KingTentacleAU	2025-06-08T11:08:20Z	Older likely Japanese film, where a man confronts an immortal warrior and must dual to the death. The description is not great. I cannot remember the setup well, its been about 20 years since i saw the movie. The main character enters some sort of building, i think it was to take shelter for the night. Meet an immortal warrior who has never been defeated, he has been cursed where the only way he can leave is to die, and have who killed him take his place there, the MC cannot leave either. The place they are trapped is filled with many different weapons. One part that's always stuck with me was, one of the weapons was an old single action revolver, where the MC keeps forgetting to pull the hammer back, and the warrior stops to remind him of that fact. It may not actually be Japanese, but it was south east Asian. I used to watch a lot of foreign films when i was a teen on free to air TV in Australia, one of the main stations SBS used to air an episode of Anime in the evening followed by a foreign film, and this was one of them. I hope my description tips someone who knows it off.

The main character was a girl who was solving some sort of mystery. I remember two scenes from the movie: one where the main character attends her older ?sisters engagement shower, where her sister opens gifts, but the main character insists on opening the gift and when she does it starts a fire. I believe it was slater revealed that her sister set it up, presumably because she wasnt happy with the wedding or something. In another scene, the main character works with a kid in a wheelchair who uses a telescope to spy on someone.

Girl A dives towards the teacher and they fall to the ground but she ends up getting shot a lot in the process. Girl B manages to escape from the room. i don't know any other part of the movie. i haven't been able to find it since i saw a snippet of it on some deserted dvd store in an empty shopping mall. that was before 2018 i think.

Sometimes I try to remember some movies I've seen on TV like 30+ years ago and there were two films I cannot find till this day. One is some kind of horror where a group of ppl ride the snowmoviles, get in an accident and end in a weird house. Some go for help and dies, others perish in nthe house (remember one being killed by hanging on the fan blades) and in the end there was smth scary. The other is maybe part of some antology where a strange kid had an insect collection - like a church with bugs and one time he fed a girl a cookied with bugs. So I'll be very happy if you help me identify those movies. Need closure xD Thx all! Upd. I've found them, thanks for all the help and responses! The Chill Factor and The Willies.

The girl goes to school and apparently there are other parents who killed their daughters on their birthday. I don't remember if it was 15 or 16. It turns out that they couldn't have children and they made a pact with the devil, who instead took over them at a certain age. The girl asks for help from a classmate of hers to baptize her and tries to drown her, saying that her soul can only be saved if she dies before the demon possesses her. In the end the girl chooses the side of evil and joins others like her, her teacher and her boyfriend too.

And even then I doubt it is the one I'm talking about. It looks soft and sweet compared to somebody, who is definitely otherworldly, blowing the heads off of three people without use of weapons. And that is the specific movie that I am looking for, but I cannot find any movie matching that description. Nobody seems to know what I'm talking about. They watched the movie and skipped past analyzing that scene. She turns on the TV, a man with red eyes, a leather vest, and sharp teeth pops on scream, screaming in the background, loud noises, and he, idk the word? Psychically(?) Idk if I even spelled it right. Blows the head off of three people standing in a row. And I'm very curious as to what that movie is and what it's about, because again. I love terrible movies, and I also want to know if it had a further message or was a nod to something else in She - Devil.	unusable

I dont remember very much about this movie except for the ending. It was about a woman who lives on a farm who harbors Jews in her house during WW2. It ends with American soldiers entering her home and they get angry with her I believe because of how well they perceive her to be living during wartime. But when they search the house the find the people she protected in her attic.

NameThatMovie	1lhk7xe	0	Jolly-Cow9560	2025-06-22T09:52:01Z	Which zombie / infection film is this? My daughter and I are trying to figure out what Zombie or otherwise infection themed film we're remembering watching together. We probably watched it a couple years ago (to rule out super new releases) In it, a woman is cutting vegetables (possibly tomatoes?) in the kitchen, cuts her fingers (possibly severs them), and bleeds black blood. I believe it's a family of 4, possibly 5. The dad and the daughter are the central figures, and the dad may wind up getting the infection himself, which possible spoiler: &gt;!prompts him to self sacrifice (possibly by throwing himself off the roof of a building) to protect his daughter before the infection takes over, possibly leaving her in the care of another person that he meets on the way.!&lt; The possibles are because I've seen a lot of infection / zombie themed films in 40 years, so I don't know for sure which aspects might be bleedovers from other films. Edit: I figured out that the finger scene was instead from the film Maggie, and there were tomatoes in the background (where the finger was being dealt with) during """"""""the finger scene."""""""" So, while it didn't fit perfectly, that scene has at least been figured out, so I'm fairly certain that we're combining a pair of films at this point, so will still need to figure out the source of the other memory that we're blending with Maggie. Edit: closed, thanks u/raulmonkey, it was the rooftop scene from World War Z for the second memory that was getting mixed in there.				
NameThatMovie	1lhk7xe	5	raulmonkey	2025-06-22T12:07:26Z	World War z has a scene where brad pit gets zombie spit in his mouth (I think) and runs up the stairs to the roof of the building where a helicopter is waiting and counts while balancing on the edge ,in case he gets infected while his wife and daughter get on the helicopter. So that he can jump if infected.	solved	World War Z (2013)	tt0816711	
NameThatMovie	1lhk7xe	5_2	Bladrak01	2025-06-22T13:35:38Z	I liked that scene, and right before it where he wraps magazines around his arms as bite protection. It was one of the few times you see someone acting intelligently in that kind of situation.				
NameThatMovie	1lhk7xe	5_3	ohheyitslaila	2025-06-22T13:39:26Z	If its not this, the ending to the second Resident Evil film also ends on a rooftop with a helicopter. The daughter goes with Alice while the dad is infected on the roof.

NameThatMovie	1lhk7xe	5_1	Jolly-Cow9560	2025-06-22T15:22:10Z	The rooftop scene from World War Z was def the second memory that was getting mixed in here. I was thinking that he sacrificed himself by jumping off the roof for the Z's to follow him, but I was instead remembering how when the family did get onto the heli, that the zombies jumped after the heli from the roof, and the intensity of the Z's jumping off was the key component in the memory. But it was mixed with that part where he thought he was infected (the """"""""it got in my mouth"""""""" part) I've found the scene on youtube to confirm it. Thank you all!	confirmed

NameThatMovie	1lhk7xe	2	Angelea23	2025-06-22T15:55:26Z	Maggie is the scene with the woman cuts her fingers. But its the daughter who is infected and is the one with the roof ending. That one is father daughter oriented Mex Unless your thinking of bus to busan. Another father an daughter movie.

Main character is a teen introvert boy with glasses who was in love with neighbor girl. Throughout the movie he gets more confident. I remember a scene where he was sitting on the curb outside his house. A lot of story was around this clean suburban neighborhood. I recall the music being fantastic. I remember he wore a plain white t shirt for a lot of scenes. The female teen lead may have been somewhat famous for 90s/2000s. Was a comedy I think, perhaps a dark comedy, but really great drama scenes as well.

She starts to observe the differences between herself and her best friend and their families and notices something is wrong. also, in this world, there's some sort of a machine in place of a heart that makes a melody when an emotion is felt. the main character's device makes loud, moving music appropriate to the feeling, while the side characters/extra's glitch, and make an uncomfortable squeaking noise. there's also a forbidden area where people are colourless, something to do with their relevance to the plot and not making the final cut. there might be some small mistakes cus it's been quite a while since I�saw�the�movie. thanks in advance

I only remember a specific scene, but it stuck with me: Theres a young girl Id say around 6 ish years old. She was white and mightve been blonde but I dont really remember. She was trapped inside a cardboard box, and black goop or ooze starts seeping in from the corners of the box. I clearly remember her yelling Daddy! for help as the black stuff got closer. The whole thing felt like a nightmare or a hallucination, or maybe part of a surreal horror sequence. I know it was definitely a movie, my mom used to watch a BUNCH of random movies so she doesnt remember this one and this was also over 10 years ago lol.

But anyways the movie start with a woman talking to her psychiatrist and she then moves in with her sister, parents are out of the picture. The town people are wary of her moving back, and a man even visits her house and attacks her.

He explains that hes her husband and hes gonna take care of her. I forget a lot of of the scenes, but I do know that theres one where her sister tries to visit her and the husband wont allow it. Theres a priest that comes to her door and speaks with her. The whole time youre thinking this is really strange. Then, you learn near the end of the movie that shes really been possessed this whole time and shes going through an exorcism. The man that told her he was her husband is really this demon/Satan thats been placating her so he can possess her body. I cannot find the name of this movie anywhere. Can someone please help me?

The scene I saw was: autumn, a couple is in a motorboat on a lake, with a shady guy they met a took with them. They have a big house near that lake. It was a darker tone kind of movie. There was probably some murder involved. Never after have I heard of this movie or seen any type of frames or scenes from it.

I remember parts of the movie, toddler brother, teenage daughter, and mother go to a family get together in a cabin. The younger children get infected with something that makes them vomit what looks like frog eggs. They start Murdering the parents in gruesome ways. Example: The uncle is found in their play tent, his intestines out on his stomach and wrapped around a toy. Then it turns out he is still alive. The teenage daughter has a tattoo of a fetus with wings on her stomach since her mom tried to abort her and it never worked. But through their differences the mother and daughter get a bond over trying to escape and survive. I was half asleep when I watched it, so I never got it's name. I don't think there were any high list celebrities. And I've tried googling the parts I remembered, but nothing came up.

From what I remember, which isnt a lot, I gathered that it must be an R rated horror/thriller movie. We also watched it with captions on so theres a chance its a foreign film. However, I can only really recall one scene clearly and the rest is pretty hazy. I would say that in maybe the first 15-20 minutes theres a scene where the main protagonist (a middle aged father of one son &amp; seemingly skinny troubled man with light scruff/facial hair) gets bad news of some kind while at work and proceeds to get in his car and scream FUUUUCKKKK really loudly like a million times on his commute home. This is the only scene that really stuck with me as a kid. The rest of what I remember about the movie is random vibes. It was a very gray/white movie. In general, I think the father was sort of a deadbeat, perhaps failing at his job, and there were marital problems of sorts. The main plot revolved around his kid being abducted by these strange nightmarish creatures. I dont think they really talked, they just dragged people behind them with chains in this weird desert dream world (I dont know where they were even taking them though). The father ends up getting his act together enough to chase them down and rescue his son though. Thats really all I have to go off of, and I know its not much, but Id love to watch this movie as an adult with more awareness and memory capacity.

There was a scene in the movie where the main characters come across a really ugly man with Puss on his face who was married to a very hot woman. And one of the characters in the movie thought that they would be able to hook up with the wife, but then when they realized that the ugly man wanted to join in, they all ran away. What the hell is the name of this movie? It is driving me insane!

Pretty sure I watched this in either 2021 or 2022. Here's what I remember of the plot: Main character, very generic """"""""dude"""""""", I keep thinking it's Liam Hemsworth but it's not, has a girlfriend and she tells him her ex is stalking her. He seems to be a lunatic. Fast forward, she either ghosts him or breaks up with him? Anyways, Liam Fakesworth tries to contact her and shows up at her place? Somehow meets a new boyfriend of hers (who she told that Unliam Hemsworth is now a creepy ex stalker). They have a fight, knife and/or gun involved. And I think there's another iteration of her telling the same story again. I don't remember how it was resolved but I guess Liam Hemsgreatvalue got the good ending. Bonus: Main character may have been a cop / firefighter something? It may have been an indie movie, but seemed very well made iirc. I tried to find this several times already with google, chatgpt, and so on. Nothing ever came up.	unsolved

whatisthatmovie	1lg99j4	0	InvincibleButterfly	2025-06-20T17:05:23Z	Please help me identify this movie/video - 90s horror??? Sometime in the 1990s, I was about to leave an old friends house (person unreachable, so I cant ask her). And about 10 minutes before I left, she put a movie into the VHS/DVD player. I remember seeing this scene which was either the intro to the movie or possibly a trailer. It was a relatively short abstract/seemingly animated scene where a real (non animated) head was shown being cut open at the top (full top of scalp), and pulled off exposing the brain. Then a voice came on saying the name of the movie as the movie title was splashed on the screen in an almost comical/whimsical font. Heres the kicker. My mind wants to remember it as the 1991 horror film Popcorn, BUT I have watched the movie and watched every trailer I can find on YouTube, and none of them show this brain scene Im remembering. So I wonder if Popcorn is even the correct film. Can anyone remember this? Edit: This could have been an 80s thing for all I know, I just know I saw it in friends house in the 90s.	unsolved

I remember seeing a few clips of it and saying I would watch it later but I didnt write down the name and I forgot. It was about a group of friends, dont remember how many but there were at least two girls. They do these kinds of urban explorations and wander on to a house that has a door in the middle of it. It is some sort of portal to another dimension and then weird things happened and there were a bunch of other doors to very surreal realities? like one in which there were giants and so on and I think they were chasing/fleeing frome someone through those doors. As far as I remember, production was very cheap-looking and acting was a bit weird. I dont really have hopes for finding it but any help will be appreciated!

That's what the whole subreddit is for. An informative title would probably get more people reading your post with interest. Moderators, please consider a group rule about this. Also, we don't need lengthy descriptions about how you and your brother used to watch this one blah blah blah and your mom once blah blah blah but for the life of you, you just can't remember blah blah blah and it's driving you crazy blah blah blah.

Body: Give what details you can remember about the movie that might help identify it, including in what year or decade you saw the movie or think it was made.

I think a few tips people need to think about our things that come out five replies later after someone suggested an incorrect movie. Like """"""""oh not that movie. This on was animated"""""""". Like come on!!! Probably a detail you should've mentioned. I don't think anyone needs to adhere to a format. But probably think about specifics that you remember. What genre? Black and white, color movie, animated movie? If not, what year it came out, what year movie was set in? """"""""Scene with a guy wearing a hat"""""""" kind of helps, but a bowler hat versus a baseball hat etc. I know a lot of the reason the sub exists is because people cannot remember a lot of details.

So i have watched this movie about 2-3 years ago and i cant remember if it was on Netflix or prime or whatever platform but all i can remember from the movie is there is this battle between angels and demons i believe and there are certain humans that become vessels for these angels the main character has this visions of this women of immense power and he later meets her in this big mansion where shes held because that mansion was built to contain her powers, anyways the main character has abilities that he cant control and this female character teaches him how to use them by doing a series of tests in a mountain i belive? One of the tests i remember being him breaking through this massive boulder with his fists, another scene i remember is there are these armored security guards that are basically controlled by the evil character in the movie and they are practically invincible bullet proof only certain weapons can harm them anyways at the end of the movie the main character manages to harness his powers and he basically wears this angel armor defeating the evil character (demon or whatever he was i cant remember much) The movie is recent and has a good budget i believe because the graphics and the cgi was really good, and it gives me the anime vibes but the movie is in english and its English actors. Can anyone please help me im desperate my adhd is doing a number on me and i cant sleep until i find this movie =-># EDIT : Another part of the movie i remember the women that is in the mansion she has an episode while asleep manifesting her powers and the whole mansion goes into lockdown, The movie is set in a futuristic/now a day ish setting aswel Second EDIT : i think the main villain is a women with like a robotic/magical arm? and i remember her going after these vessels(main character) and consume them for power or whatever her goal was i can't 100% remember

(my childhood) What i remember: Animation style was like in ''UP!'' There was an evil queen that chased someone or a group of people. There was a scene where in a thunderstorm she appeared in the light of lightning rays and i remember that scared the shit out of me. The people running where in a dessert at one point maybe. There was a joke where they where running in a field and there was a random gate with no fence. they ran through it and the last one closed the gate. The chaser/queen had a castle in/on a cliff. There was a cave in the cliff where when she caught the person she was chasing she chained them up there. There was def a thunderstorm with lightning at the start when the queen begun to chase.

I think the victim tries to fight back but (this is the most accurate memory) one of them pulls out 2 syringes and injects the oher one in the neck.

So around the early 2000s me and my siblings would go to our grandmas house all the time. She had this orange vhs tape and it was a Halloween special or something. It was a series of different clips of kids. I remember one of them was waking up in the morning and this kid seeing his family brushing teeth, eating breakfast, etc. with a song going scary monsters, monsters in the morning. Another was a fake news clip where the reporter turns into a ware wolf I think. There was another clip I remember being in a dark room with a bed in the middle of the room. My sister and I have been trying to figure it out forever &amp; we just cant seem to find it! Any help would be appreciated! Our grandma used to thrift shop a lot so the movie could be from anytime.

I am trying to remember a movie that I watched back in the early 2000s on TV, in it it had two """"""""monks"""""""", (not sure if they were actually called monks) in the movie but they did train in a monastery/school to allow them to control things and potentially people with their minds. The part that I remember the most is at the end, one of the monks controls a knife (at least I think it was) with his mind and uses it to stab the other guy in the forehead with it. The last scene is the guy who was stabbed waking up in the hospital where the nurse or doctor tells him they had to remove part of his brain, but its ok no one uses that part, only for the guy to realise he can no longer use his power.

It was an action movie, probably released in the 80s or 90s the hero character had to swim into a location for the final mission or something. I think he had to rescue someone? Or storm the fortress of some bad guy. To get better at holding his breath, he would submerge himself fully in a bathtub while a cigarette was lit nearby. He was using a burning cigarette as timer. He did that a few times. I believe there was a mentor figure or some associate of his who warned him before the final arc of the movie that swimming with purpose will burn through your oxygen reserves a little faster than just sitting in a tub. I dont remember much else about the movie, just the cigarette as a timer for holding your breath mostly. Its been bothering me for days. Any ideas?

This animated film, released in 2000, features children and anthropomorphic animals, and includes the """"""""Gnu Song"""""""".

First off: this could be ANY movie, she watches a lot of bad movies while shes crafting. Heres what she thinks she remembers: -Man lives in a high rise -He has premonitions or dreams about disaster (or about a singular disaster/accident) -There is a subway tunnel that collapses -There is a train that the man and his family board -The bridge that the train is crossing collapses/crumbles behind the train as is crosses (the train doesnt crash) Please remember that any of the above information could be a red herring. She watches a LOT of movies/tv shows and sometimes the information might be incorrect/blended with other movies

It was on an island. Gave Wickerman and Midsomar vibes but it wasn't either of those. ETA: Either American or British, in English.

I CANT REMEMBER TO SAVE MY LIFE! okay so a little while, back I watched this sci-fi show on Roku channel(yes yes ik super lame lol). The show was superrr good, but i had to put a pause on it since I had to go to school nd stuff wtv, wtv. Anyways, the show was about this teenage boy whos dad was barely in his life because he was an astronaut, but his son never hated him for it or anything like that I think. The boy had a childhood friend, a mom, and a school where he would get bullied because his dad was a famous astronaut while he was, pretty much, a loser. Then he meets this girl who he lwk likes but she has a secret of her own. soon he finds out that his dad wasnt a normal astronaut but was either an alien or worked with aliens (i cant remember). so an organization, who worked with his father, hunted this boy down since the father died and tried to get info about his father off him and stuff. They realized he knew nothing and left which, unsurprisingly, spiked the boys interest in his father. DOES ANYONE KNOW THIS SHOW?!?? PLSS I BEGG

whatsthemoviecalled	1lhgddb	0	CertainSilence	2025-06-22T05:32:43Z	2000s renaissance film. I think it's a Johnny Depp movie. But my memory is hazy. It's setting is 1700s to 1800s or something around renaissance, not medieval. It's a dark movie about reality and people living in poverty in gothic Europe. Not sure if it's fantasy, action or just plain drama. The only scene I can remember is one of the protagonist fell in love with a waitress/hostess but the waitress said he fell in love with a corpse. I think she's suffering from severe tuberculosis and died after a few scenes. Not really sure about any of the stuff I said but would greatly appreciate any suggestions that fits these descriptions. Thanks in advance! It's not """"""""Perfume: The Story of a Murderer"""""""".

whatisthatmovie	1lh437t	0	1rstclassgrl11	2025-06-21T19:01:34Z	Need help finding name of older movie Hello I have been searching for a particular movie for so many years and Ive tried different Google searches and each time found no results. I suspect because its such an old movie, perhaps 40s and 50s. I only saw bits and pieces of it most likely on TCM (Turner Classic Movies). What I did see of it, it was about a family who I think were having trouble with their mortgage and a man came to their house to collect money or give them a deadline as to which to make the payment otherwise they would lose the home. The Father had his son do something to the mans car to where the man ended up having to stay there with the family and ended up really liking the family and even falling in love with the daughter. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

whatsthemoviecalled	1l8en4b	0	Mrchupaouvaisape	2025-06-11T00:09:16Z	Looking for a teen/adult sex comedy from the 2000searly 2010s I've been trying to find this bizarre sex comedy movie I saw sometime in the late 2000s/ maybe early 2010s, it could have been made early than that, it was just the approximate year I watched it. It might have been a french film, the version I saw was dubbed in French but my parents used to watch all movies dubbed in french so maybe it was not. It was a long time ago and I was a kid so heres what I remember: The story follows two male virgins, (maybe adults, maybe teenagers), who are trying to lose their virginity, and look like dorks or geeks. One of them is quiet, and the other is louder, both are perverts. The quiet one always wears a bucket hat, which was basically his signature look throughout the film. Theres a scene where the quiet one records his neighbors having sex through the window, and its played as creepy/perverted. Theres a weird visual gag where when they get an erection, usually from flirting or seeing a woman, their penis becomes comically hugelike an over-the-top, CGI-style visual joke. In the end of the movie they both get girlfriends and loose they're virginity, (I think the girls were potrayed as ugly, not sure) The humor was really childish, almost slapstick or cartoonish, but still had very adult content (sex, nudity, etc.). I remember thinking it was kind of dumb and absurd, but its a memory from my childhood I occasionally think about.

In it 2 persons, probably women, are in a house and start arguing then prepare to attack each other, just as another woman enters the house and totally oblivious to the first 2 persons actions she starts taking away, forcing the first 2 persons to hide their actions and pretend that things are fine between them. The 2 persons who almost attacked each other, possibly have no choice but to work together. Movie is action or comedy. I would be grateful if you can identify this movie.

Everybody was wearing black, except the young girl who is in her early to mid 20s, she is wearing a white gown. They like this platform on fire and one of two things happen. 1) she jumps off and her mother takes the place and gets burnt on the platform as the young girl runs away through a field. 2) her mother has a change of heart and pushes her off the platform and sacrifices herself to be burned, and the girl runs through a field to get away. As shes running through the field, the movie ends and thats it. Thats all I can remember.

On the sideline this new mother has her newborn and another soccer mom asks if she can have the baby, and the mom just gives her baby away forever (she later asks for the baby back but they dont give it back). At one point theres a bbq pool party and someones ~12 year old son jumps into the pool, but mid air he turns into a golden retriever and everyone just rolls with it. The dog goes to school, his grades start slipping, and the parents hire a tutor for their dog/son. Its a super weird low budget movie but it was kind of hilarious.

whatsthemoviecalled	1lddg57	8	Effective-Prior-9760	2025-06-17T04:49:00Z	28 days later (after) I think this happens. Maybe the second one was 28 weeks later?				
whatsthemoviecalled	1lddg57	2_1_1	ThisIsPunn	2025-06-17T06:00:22Z	You might be conflating Brendan Gleeson's character in 28 Days Later (who this happens to) and Ty Burrell's character in the 2003 remake of Dawn of the Dead?				
whatsthemoviecalled	1lddg57	9	weenysandwich55	2025-06-17T06:03:58Z	Definitely 28 days later				
whatsthemoviecalled	1lddg57	6	raulmonkey	2025-06-17T07:35:22Z	28 days later definitely has this scene. Brenda gleeson looks up at a crow that has just eaten (an eyeball?) And a drop of infected blood drops into his eye, he then shouts at the girl to run and becomes a rage infected zombie.

Not sure why but i also feel like it has something to do with Robert De Niro...

whatisthatmovie	1k6ntnk	0	Chronocide23	2025-04-24T09:16:57Z	Help naming movie? This is going to be a hard one because I remember too little about it. The main thing I remember is the characters, men, trying to join a club(loose term, maybe a secret society?) and after joining they would cut a horizontal line across their skin just below the pant line, above the crotch. It was part of the Induction process. I think they'd show each other the scar as an """"""""I'm one of you"""""""" sign. MAYBE it was a white guy trying to gain the trust of Native Americans? I remember this from when I was younger, so its probably from the 90's or earlier. I literally can't remember anything else about the movie.				
whatisthatmovie	1k6ntnk	2	Chronocide23	2025-04-24T11:54:03Z	I think it was a Emilio Estevez movie... was this a mighty ducks thing? He wasn't allowed to play on the team without the scar? Ugh... this is killing me.				
whatisthatmovie	1k6ntnk	2_1	Chronocide23	2025-04-24T12:01:26Z	Maybe Michael J Fox? Definitely in that Era.				
whatisthatmovie	1k6ntnk	2_2	Chronocide23	2025-04-24T12:06:29Z	Its definitely a sports movie about a guy who joins the team last minute. Like a tribal cut to prove he's one of them. Basketball maybe?

whatmoviewasthat	1lbgzmk	0	EmmeMajor	2025-06-14T19:31:33Z	Horror movie similar to Until Dawn Okay, I actually read the description on this one so the accuracy might be off, but it was like a woman and her sister fall from a cliff and only one survives and has to cannibalize the other and becomes a wendigo..? Or possibly, the one woman's friends come back to this place and the sister gets revenge..? Does that sound familiar to anyone?				
whatmoviewasthat	1lbgzmk	1	TennisSpirited6796	2025-06-15T00:13:27Z	Sounds very similar to the game Until Dawn				
whatmoviewasthat	1lbgzmk	1_1	EmmeMajor	2025-06-15T01:09:30Z	That would certainly explain why I found it similar but different. I must have twisted the description and vids of gameplay in my head. Would you happen to know if there was a butterfly tattoo on the wendigo's body? Or am I mixing something else in?				
whatmoviewasthat	1lbgzmk	1_1_1	TennisSpirited6796	2025-06-15T13:29:22Z	There is indeed a butterfly tattoo on the wendigo

You follow a cop or a park ranger when a naked person comes out of nowhere covered in red (blood?). The person is non-responsive and just walks and stares. If I remember correctly I they reach you, die or something like that. I think most of the movie takes place during daytime. By the end of the movie it turns out that red people have ben popping up in other places in the country. A vague description, I know. It was a long time ago. Does anyone know what I'm talking about?

whatsthemoviecalled	1kmmsub	0	ConsequenceFade	2025-05-14T18:35:02Z	Trying to find the name of a movie from the 80s (maybe late 70s) So I remember the opening pretty clearly and saw this movie as a child in the 80s. It starts off with a guy who is walking around some train tracks and sees a turtle. He goes to pick up the turtle when the tracks switch and his foot is caught. Of course, a train starts coming towards him but he struggles and can't free himself. As it comes closer to him he desperately yells """"""""Stop!!"""""""". The train comes to a stop. The conductor eventually runs out of the train but after some discussion, he says he didn't see the guy and never actually used the brakes (so the train stopped by itself). It turns out the guy who got his foot stuck had special powers to move things. I don't remember much of the rest of the movie but I recall liking the ending. And the beginning has always stuck with me... that image of him stopping the train. Any ideas what the name could be? I searched online and couldn't find anything.

And they start experiencing weird shit around the home, there might be a crazy lady who lives on the far end of the property, and it might have been because there were like aliens or other things living in a well in her house and they crawl out and try to kill/or shapeshift into the family members and it becomes like a home invasion movie??

Set in rural Europe possibly early 20th century. Lead actor was 30-ish attractive Irish looking with black hair. His character was a studious type, visiting a hamlet. I think the young son of the farmer he was staying with was the werewolf. He tracks animal mutilations amidst the crops. The ending takes place in the village church, at night, where townfolks have taken sanctuary and there's a weird supernatural 'osmosis' whereby the mother dies but the son is cured of his lycanthropy.

They're interrupted all the time by odd phone calls where the host goes silent and only says YES or NO. Today I remembered one of those scenes that always make me laugh out loud, while most people feel meh about it. I need to watch it today please =O<� The movie is likely to be a satirical comedy like """"""""Big short"""""""" but I'm not sure... it's the same kind of tone and humor. In the scene, there are two men in an office setting (or home office). Both are sitting in chairs, in one man's office or wfh room. I believe the host has a moustache and it's a known face (ie male actor with dozens of movies and TV appearances) The two men are having a casual conversation and the guest is asking a favor or sorting something with the host. The tone is casual. Then the phone rings. The host goes silent for a couple mins and then says YES and hangs up. He doesn't say """"""""Hi"""""""" or talk with the person on the phone at all. The only word he says is YES or NO. They continue the casual conversation. Same story, phone rings, host says NO, hangs up. And this keeps on happening. The scene illustrates the absurdity of some leadership roles, and the absurdity of having a casual conversation while being interrupted for critical items all the time. The movie is very likely from year 2000 onward. Thanks in advance! =O<�

whatisthatmovie	1kmsnua	0	Agitated_Newspaper92	2025-05-14T22:37:02Z	Guy sitting at a computer picks up several pieces of French toast and dips them in syrup Hey y'all - would appreciate any help. I can only remember one scene, and I don't know if I'm recalling correctly. Feel like I saw it in theater before college - so maybe 2002-2010ish. All I can remember is a basement dweller type guy, think the guy from the WoW episode of South Park, picking up several pieces of French toast and dipping them in syrup. (Don't think we see their face.) I think the setup is: Avi or robot of hot chick is asked, """"""""You're really a girl, right?"""""""" Avi says yes and the scene cuts to our guy controlling the Avi helping himself to French toast - feel like I remember people laughing and saying """"""""ewwww"""""""" in the theater. I cannot for the life of the me remember any other detail, and, apparently, there is some guy called French Toast which has made searching a pain in the ass. Thought it was Surrogates, but nah. Please help solve this mystery - been searching whenever inspiration strikes for over a month now.

Ive been searching for this movie on which a trailer I saw years ago but I never got around to watching it. So basically theres this man, hes with some kind of top secret organization that has discovered time travel. With this new breakthrough they assign him to travel back in time to investigate the bombing of a train, and who is responsible. Each time he times travels he has a limited amount of time before he is sent back(I think 8 minutes to be exact) back to his hq before he is sent back to continue his assignment. Along the way he runs into this woman, and he ends up falling in love with her then gets completely derailed from his original mission. He then has a personal goal of saving said woman and finding out whose behind the bombing(Im not sure how this movies time science works so i dont know if changing something in past directly impacts the future but Im assuming it does) thanks!!

All I can remember is the last scene. It's a snowy crowded town and the father of the kidnapped child spots him but as he thinks about approaching him he sees that he's accompanied by the person who took him (a vampire or something). The child is now a vampire himself or is evil. I really want to say the child makes eye contact and winks at his dad or gives him a smerk to show his fangs a little bit maybe? Idk I also have a faint memory of the little teapot being sang sometime in the movie. I have searched for this movie on and off for years and never find it.

The teapot song is featured in the miniseries, too. Trust me, this is what you are looking for.				
whatsthemoviecalled	1le90ye	3	internectual	2025-06-18T08:35:03Z	Sounds like you're remembering elements from [Abigail](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27489557/). Child vampire ballerina kidnapped for ransom is actually a trap. I think she sang """"""""I'm A Little Teapot"""""""" while dancing in one scene. It's from 2024 though.

whatsthemoviecalled	1l6iutr	6	DefinitelyBiscuit	2025-06-08T18:21:02Z	The ear/slug thing is making me think wrath of Khan. Krull had a cyclops character. Any chance these are the 2 you might be mixing up?

whatsthemoviecalled	1l6iutr	5	Open-Bed-2423	2025-06-08T18:35:35Z	Sounds like Krull with the quicksand and Cyclops. Also there's slug like thing when the evil soldiers get killed. Cheers				
whatsthemoviecalled	1l6iutr	2_1	EyeoftheRedKing	2025-06-08T18:35:52Z	Yep, guessing the slug scene is Beastmaster. The cyclops is probably from Krull. There's also a scene in Krull where a body has been disposed of in a sandy bog and floats back up (the quicksand). I think OP is merging the two.				
whatsthemoviecalled	1l6iutr	3	Skipper_TheEyechild	2025-06-08T18:51:24Z	Krull, definitely Krull. Great film with a great soundtrack. Also basically has the same score as Star Trek The Wrath Of Khan. Both composed by Horner. Funnily enough, the slug scene you might be remembering could be the slug like creatures that pop out of the slayers when they die, or could also be the slug Khan inserts into Chekovs ear.				
whatsthemoviecalled	1l6iutr	4	mr_bynum	2025-06-08T22:44:29Z	Beastmaster has a scene where they put something into a guys ear and turn him into a raging brainless kill monster?				
whatsthemoviecalled	1l6iutr	3_1	Pitiful-Ad-1152	2025-06-08T22:47:50Z	Horner also scored Battle Beyond the Stars, and IT TOO sounds very similar to both. I think in his early career, he recycled his themes a lot.

whatsthemoviecalled	1ldpc0p	0	ChaoticNeutralJesus	2025-06-17T14:58:01Z	Looking to find an old horror movie... This movie would've been from the 70s or 80s, and I'm trying to remember what I can. I remember windows being nailed shut, a ghost killing someone with an axe (or maybe a knife), and someone else getting killed by a window closing on them and breaking their neck. Not a lot of info, but it's been 40+ years ago when I saw it last.

whatsthemoviecalled	1ldpc0p	7	astroZombie1978	2025-06-17T15:45:42Z	Ghost Story? Maybe?				
whatsthemoviecalled	1ldpc0p	8	oblivion_1138	2025-06-17T16:05:03Z	The Boogeyman? I've only seen it once, but the window scene sounds very familiar.				
whatsthemoviecalled	1ldpc0p	9	Infamous_Ad2094	2025-06-17T16:25:46Z	Maybe the original 13 Ghosts? From around 1960 or so.				
whatsthemoviecalled	1ldpc0p	2	Horror-Final-Girl	2025-06-17T16:52:14Z	Fright Night? 1985 Amityville Horror? 1979 House? 1985 The Changeling? 1980 I know I've seen the head and window scene, I don't know if it's a decapitation or not, but I just can't remember which movie. I also remember the windows being nailed shut, but I could be thinking of a different movie, that's why I gave you these for possibilities that I could think of.				
whatsthemoviecalled	1ldpc0p	3	rectum_nrly_killedum	2025-06-17T17:00:19Z	Is it [The Evil](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077524/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk)?

whatsthemoviecalled	1ldpc0p	2_1	ChaoticNeutralJesus	2025-06-17T17:20:37Z	Def not Amityville or The Changeling, as I've watched both many times. I'm pretty sure it wasn't Fright Night. I don't remember much about House, so it might be worth looking into. The window scene wasn't a decapitation, just someone trying to climb out, and it shuts (like a person closing a window, as opposed to falling quickly,) and breaks the neck of the kid trying to get out. Seems like it was daytime while it was happening, and it was an old farmhouse. Possibly a two story house. Thanks for the suggestions!	thanks?			
whatsthemoviecalled	1ldpc0p	2_1_1	Horror-Final-Girl	2025-06-17T17:22:49Z	No problem. Good luck, hope you find it! I wouldn't mind knowing what it is myself.				
whatsthemoviecalled	1ldpc0p	3_1	ChaoticNeutralJesus	2025-06-17T17:26:14Z	This is close. Definitely has the same time period feel to it, and similar premise.

whatsthemoviecalled	1ldpc0p	6_1	ChaoticNeutralJesus	2025-06-17T18:58:13Z	So far, Boogeyman feels like the closest to it. It'll probably be the weekend before I can confirm, though.

whatsthemoviecalled	1krdbkr	0	blu3_paint	2025-05-20T19:08:23Z	Can't recall a low budget horror/thriller movie It was a slasher/horror/thriller that starts with bunch of teenagers going into an abandoned house to participate in some kind of ritual/tarot reading. But at the last moment, they change their mind. It turns out that the man who suggested them to do that ritual/reading actually wanted to lure them into the house on purpose for some killers/vengeful spirits Spirits of 3 teens/ killers (2 girls and one guy) start killing them. There was a lot of singing. I remember there was a scene in the kitche where someone was about to be cooked (?). Also, a scene where a girl got killed in an empty swimming pool with a chainsaw. There was a moment of breaking the 4th wall where the killers sang that they did it all because we, the watchers, enjoy watching at murder. If I remember right, it had 2 parts, but I am not sure. It is a niche movie. The whole movie gave very strong theatrical vibe.

For context I was born in 1997 and would have watched this before I was 13, Im thinking I was about 9-10 so its not any movie after 2010. What I can remember is a group of young women, witches maybe but they might have just been doing a spell, in a big circle with a bonfire in the middle, throwing chicken legs and maybe other animal parts in a cauldron in the middle and they start out in all white dresses and eventually are chanting and dancing around the circle nude, there might be blood on them but Im not sure. Ive looked at so many movies and googled until my eyes hurt but I just cannnnnot find it.

I can remember the plot in pretty specific detail but mostly from the trailer, which was doing the rounds at the time on youtube - there was an Italian man who, although in a relationship with someone else, developed a crush on a French girl (I think the thumbnail was her looking over her shoulder as she rides a bike? She had dark hair and dark eyes, fair skin). There was a German woman who worked as a flight attendant and one scene (also in the trailer) involved someone she was sleeping with asking her to speak German to him so she began reciting the safety awareness briefing from the beginning of every flight. She was blonde. There was a fourth person too and the tone of the movie was light-hearted hijinks as everyone confusedly fell in love with each other even though they all had somebody else. I'm pretty sure at some point the Italian man accidentally broke his French crush's leg and so offers to help take care of her kids while his partner (possibly the German woman?) is away. Keen for any leads! Thanks in advance.

I remember little bits and pieces but one thing I remember vividly is a scene where a little girl puts on a pair of pants her mother had been repairing, and the needle was left in the pants. When the girl sits down the needle jabs her in the butt. I remember very little else about the film other than the fact that it was definitely a tragic story. I believe the girl, (a younger sister) dies of cancer later in the film? I cannot recall if this is implied to be a result of the nuclear bombings of Japan but that seems likely. It is not Grave of the Fireflies.

The film is set in the 19th century. The main character is a Polish nobleman, well educated and French-speaking. He is arrested by the Russians and sent to Siberia. His young wife goes to Siberia after some time to be by his side. In the gulag, she helps the head of the colony by teaching his children or looking after them. In time, she gives birth to three children, but they all die - probably of typhus. After the death of the third child, he asks the warden for a cart and an escort soldier to transport the child's body in a coffin. In reality, she hides her husband in the coffin. At night she secretly feeds him while the soldier sleeps. They travel for a long time and arrive in a town (probably in Turkey or with oriental architecture). Thank you in advance.

I cant even remember if it was a movie or tv series but I only watched it within the last few years! So I remember theres a girl who is constantly drawing flowers on her sketchpad. Theyre always the same flowers like a border or something. Now I cant remember if its a teacher or friend or what but someone else is lying in bed with a bloke and as she looks up she sees the exact flowers that were being drawn by the girl sketching on the ceiling as like a pattern around the light. (One of the old fashioned fancy white ceiling fixture things) which is like a wake up call that the girl sketching had been in the bed with him. I dont remember if its a thriller type thing where its really bad shes been there or if its a cheating type thing but its really bugging me!! Please help!!

whatsthemoviecalled	1lerlxh	0	Davjib	2025-06-18T20:25:22Z	Hey guys got a scene stuck in my head and cant bring to mind what its from So basically I believe it is the cold open to a TV show ( may be wrong) probably something crime solving related. I remember its a bunch of nuns running through the streets fighting with little context to start, then it seems theyre fighting over something and it gives the impression that theyre corrupted and being greedy over whatever it is they keep stealing from one another. All while running through the streets with whoevers in possession of the thing running away from the rest of them. Then I believe at the end it turns out its the opposite of what were led to believe and whatever the thing is (possibly a bomb) is guaranteed to kill one of them and they are fighting each other so that the rest survive and only the nun holding the item is sacrificed? Thats all I remember and its just the one short scene but I believe its all instigated by an unknown killer/ psychopath.

Later on, as they are walking again, they suddenly hear a click sound and they all stop walking immediately because land mines make that sound when stepped on. The soldier who stepped on the mine needs to stay in place and not move or the mine would explode. He stays that way for most of the movie.

whatmoviewasthat	1lijiyx	0	bruised__violet	2025-06-23T15:26:20Z	A cliche filled romcom from the 00s where the guy and girl meet while inside a video store at night when it's closed, hiding. He owns a shop(?), she's """"""""kooky"""""""" and swims in other people's pools. It seems like one of the stars was quite well-known. And I keep thinking the females was of Asian heritage but maybe not. Guy was white tho. I watched this free on a steaming service 1 or 2 summers ago. Idk why but it popped up into my mind today and it's driving me mad that I can't remember who was in it.				
whatmoviewasthat	1lijiyx	1	bruised__violet	2025-06-23T15:28:32Z	I'm pretty sure it was from 2004 to 2008. I keep thinking 2007 but can't find it on any lists.				
whatmoviewasthat	1lijiyx	2	bruised__violet	2025-06-23T15:34:07Z	Oh and it's an American movie (maybe Canadian?). It might be low budget indie.				
whatmoviewasthat	1lijiyx	5	Budget_Ad_5608	2025-06-23T17:10:58Z	could it be mallrats?				
whatmoviewasthat	1lijiyx	5_1	bruised__violet	2025-06-23T17:12:29Z	No, definitely not a KS movie, and is definitely from the mid to late 00s.				
whatmoviewasthat	1lijiyx	5_1_1	Budget_Ad_5608	2025-06-23T17:13:45Z	oh okay, i have one more guess but its a newer movie called jamesy boy, sorry if thats also wrong lol. also wdym by ks movie?

whatmoviewasthat	1lijiyx	5_1_1_1	bruised__violet	2025-06-23T17:39:18Z	The only movie I can find called 'Jamesy Boy' is a violent biographical crime drama from 2014 that takes place in prisons, youth detention centres, and strip clubs. Is this the one you're referring to? And KS was short for Kevin Smith.				
whatmoviewasthat	1lijiyx	4	bruised__violet	2025-06-23T17:52:20Z	Okay so after searching thru lists of all the Romcoms from 2004 to 2009, I still couldn't find it. So decided to begun searching for all the movies of well-known Asian-American female actors. Luckily decided to start with Lucy Liu. It's 'Watching the Detectives' (2007). So I was spot on with the year. Apparently it never got a theatrical release and was DTV so I guess that's why it's not on lists. Also my locale, outside the US, never helps with searches as so many things not local don't show up or are blocked. That only took 2 hours or my day, I could've been more productive. But at least I've got peace of mind...at least for the next 27 minutes or so. The funny thing is, her character reminds me of my myself - or at least who I used to be. She's even wearing a pair of sunglasses I used to own (have begun watching it again). And does things I've done. I guess I shouldn't be annoyed my old friends called me """"""""quirky"""""""", as much as I detest that term and its implications. At least nobody's calling me that anymore, I suppose.				
whatmoviewasthat	1lijiyx	3_1	bruised__violet	2025-06-23T17:57:15Z	I didn't see this until after I'd found it myself. Thank you, that's it. I started watching it again just to make sure.	solved?

One of them has sex with a guy the first night there and he ends up robbing them. Since they dont have money now, they start working in a castle/hotel where the owner is a lady. They find out that in this castle there is some sort of magical miniature model of the castle with little figures representing the guests, and when you put these figures together in the model, they end up there in real life and hook up. In the end they end up hooking up with each other.

The main character I believe is a guy who's really fast in typing in coordinates to warp (I believe that was it) Another part of the movie I seem to remember is where he main character goes out into battle with others in small spaceships and his friend's spaceship is badly damaged and tries to land back on the deck but crashes on the landing area, then a drone comes out and pushes away the wrecked ship. The end I do remember and it's where the main character is jumping warps or gates and he has to enter a big big code so the enemy that follows him ends up at the biiiiiiiiiiiiiiig fleet of human ships and they get destroyed cuz the enemy is jumping the gates I think it was. It's an older movie, and nothing to do with Star Wars or Star Trek I really hope someone can help out here !

whatmoviewasthat	1l8cylb	0	mir_smith	2025-06-10T22:52:45Z	Move from another universe? I remember this one, but I also remember another film very similar to the premise Birth starring Nicole Kidman. It was a woman who lost her husband, but her brother-in-law, which was her dead husband's brother, claimed that he's actually her husband' spirit. The wife initially did not believe that her husband was actually in his brother's body. She thought her brother-in-law was a liar, but eventually, with all the things that he knew, she figured it must be her husband coming back to life; but she realized that her brother-in-law actually just read the letters that was written to her. He studied everything down to a T and was able to Regurgitate the information as if he was him. The movie came out around 2005 to 2008. I cannot remember the actors names nor can I remember the movie title. Every time I try to look for the movie based on how I describe it, it keeps coming up with this film or other similar, but never the exact one. I feel like i watched it in an alternate universe. Please tell me somebody remembers it!

whatsthemoviecalled	1kj5rzk	3_1_1	Bitter_Depth_3350	2025-05-10T09:06:47Z	Awesome. It was one of my favorite sci-fi series ever. Looking online, it seems you have to buy the seasons from a distributer like Amazon. That said, if you like crass humor like Seth Rogen movies (he is an executive producer/writer and eventually a character), it is worth the purchase. There are a lot of dick jokes and the like, but the sci-fi concepts are realized in a way that most """"""""high-brow"""""""" sci-fi fails to achieve. I may have to buy the seasons myself.

College girl is having literature classes (I guess) and she dates a disabled guy because she thought a disabled would be nicer, but the guy is kind of an ass. One night she is distressed and goes out alone and finds her professor in a bar, they end up sleeping together, and he wants her to call him nigger. The next class they are discussing a novel with an interracial relationship, and they end up both arguing about their encounter while masking it as being about the book.

In the background there is a duo seated in a copy of the Time Machine from the 2002 movie The Time Machine, the scene switches back and forth between both callers and in between each cut between the speaking characters the machine disappears leaving behind smoke as if it time travelled. The machine/time travel was completely irrelevant to the plot and was simply an Easter egg for attentive viewers. Appreciate the help

One scene I recall were bot-like creatures (or aliens?) chasing people who were outside and killing them instantly. Something along the lines of Hellraiser flying orbs. And people trying to run back inside for safety. Edit: Can't edit title but I meant Phantasm flying orbs not Hellraiser. I think it would classified as sci-fi than horror. It's definitely not Phantasm, Aliens or Tremors. I'm pretty sure it came out before 2000. I don't recall much because I saw it many years ago on cable. I was flipping through channels when it was on and didn't watch it from the start. I think there was a love interest that came later (or blossomed later) in the movie.

Saw this on TV in the early 00s, guessing it first came out a few years before that. In the movie, there are a number of aliens disguised as men in black suits (I believe also wearing hats) pretending to be humans. They look convincing enough, but their knowledge of human customs falls short and it is played up for comedic effect. One line I remember is one of the aliens asking a man, who was smoking a cigarette, if he was aware there was a burning stick hanging from his face - or something to that effect. There's also a scene in an elevator (eerily specific, I know). It probably also had liberal use of fisheye lens effects. ~~Not entirely sure this is from the same movie, but I also remember a scene where one of the aliens, upon first arriving on Earth, steps out onto the road to try and shake hands with a car coming down the road, and they get hit. They later mention there were so many cars all over, the aliens thought cars were the dominant species on the planet.~~ This scene is in fact from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and not the movie I am looking for.

I can't remember if the narration of the TV series ever even mentioned it.

There is a nuclear holocaust and a race of mutants inhabits the earth. A stronghold of people are living in a house in a valley which has copper embedded in the hills surrounding their compound that keeps them safe. The movie is in color. Great drama as the tension builds throughout the movie without showing the mutants outside the compound. The owner of the compound is very proud of the fact that he engineered the compound knowing a nuclear apocalypse was inevitable.

Anything I've tried researching doesn't seem the right answer. It's sword and sorcery, possibly barbarian. There's a female warrior who has been captured and is in some dark stone room/temple. The villain there is I think also a woman. There's a large shield with a woman's profile etched on it. When they slice a sword through the etching on the shield, the warrior gets a cut on herself in the same place. That's all I saw/remember.				
whatmoviewasthat	1la3tel	5	renfield1969	2025-06-13T02:13:10Z	Could you be conflating some details? There is a fight scene in """"""""Red Sonja"""""""" where she is fighting the female villain and the alchemist is magically slicing her from across the room.

whatsthemoviecalled	1kkgxr6	0	Doonsday_Gambit	2025-05-12T01:43:42Z	Been wondering what this movie is for at least 2 decades I was watching this horror (I think) movie on TV when I was a kid, probably between 2000 and 2005. Shortly after starting it, my dad asked me to go out and rake the leaves and help out with other yard work. By the time we were done the movie was either over or I couldn't find it on the TV again. But the beginning has stuck with me through the years so hopefully someone can help me out and give me some peace of mind! So the movie takes place at a carnival, or at least the beginning did. Think there were a bunch of kids that were visiting the carnival that were meant to be out protagonists but I don't remember anything about them. The thing I really remember is that the carnival owner is trying to get his star attraction to stay but she's not having any of it. She's going to move to LA to become an actress i think. Before she leaves for good she enters a funhouse or a haunted house attraction to meet her boyfriend or someone I think. However there's this sarcophagus that they've set up here that's new. I think it was supposed to be their new big attraction or something. In not sure where they got it from but it ends up being haunted or cursed and this girl ends up getting sucked into or dragged into the sarcophagus. I'm not sure if it was via mummy bandages or if hands grabbed her or not. Feel like it was bandages but I honestly can't remember. After that I don't know what happens as I got called away. It definitely had an 80's B- movie feel to it. My googling over the years hasn't helped me figure out what this movie was. Turns out there's a lot of movies about carnivals and sarcophaguses (which just leads me to mummy movies) Does this sound familiar to anyone!? EDIT: I'm pretty positive the movie is Ghoulies 2! The scene in question was one of the carnival workers preparing to leave the carnival but had to find her cat first. She didn't get sucked into a sarcophagus like I thought but she did stick her hand in one that one of the Ghoulie then cut up. Then they jump her and do what Ghoulies apparently do. Could have sworn the scene ended with a close up of the sarcophagus as it finished sucking her into it but the rest of the scene is so close to what I remember that I'm thinking I got some details wrong. Thanks everyone! And for anyone that thought it might be a segment to a show like Tales from the Crypt or So Weird, that was a good idea! I never considered that i was having so much trouble due to it being a smaller segment! But I do think it's Ghoulies 2 in this case. Thanks for all your help!

A detective interviews a young woman with childhood trauma. It unfolds that the girl witnessed her mother being murdered by poison on board a ship with the intent to steal the loose diamonds that the mother was transporting. The story is set during World War 2. At the beginning of the film there is a scene on a transatlantic liner where two couples are having fun at a dancers and then go to the cabin of one of them, who has a small daughter. Invited to the cabin, the couple kill the couple and at this point the ship is hit by a submarine. An evacuation takes place. The film then moves to the post-war years when the child who survived the ship is now a grown woman. She tries to find her parents killers. She seems to lure the killers through television. In the films finale, it turns out that her parents were killed for diamonds hidden in a doll she had on the ship. I always thought it starred George Hamilton but there is nothing in his filmography that matches this film for me.

This movie was loosely based on the book Pilgrims Progress and came out before the year 2014. The movie had a dystopian post apocalyptic feel to it. The main character was a young man. The movie was geared towards kids or young adults probably rated PG or PG13. Its also possible that the movie was direct to DVD and did not go to theaters. The movie had a strong Christian influence and possibly religious undertones. Im starting to think I just dreamed this movie and it doesnt exist lol. Any help is appreciated.

whatmoviewasthat	1li7avs	0	Hidingwolf	2025-06-23T04:15:13Z	60's/70s musical comedy, Arabian themed, TV or movie...Bob Denver? The part I saw: Everyone was dressed Arabian style, and I think the set was in a big tent. Bob Denver (I think) was trying to romance this beautiful woman. He offered her a seat on a zebra skin couch. She said, """"""""I could never sit on a dead animal."""""""" and he said """"""""Would you prefer a live one?"""""""" Eventually this big guy with a beard who was a sheik or something arrived to invite the woman to his palace, and he sang a song about all the wonderful things she would experience there, and Bob Denver kept interrupting singing """"""""What about me, me, me? What about me, me, me?"""""""" I've pretty much given up on ever identifying this, but thought I'd take another stab at it. I saw just a bit of it on TV when I was a kid, probably in the 70s. It caught my attention because (I believe) Bob Denver was in it, and we always loved seeing the Gilligan's Island cast in other things. But I see nothing in his IMDB that sounds like what I saw, so it may have been part of a TV series, or a fantasy or dream sequence from something. (Definitely NOT Gilligan's Island, I grew up with that, have the DVDs, all pretty much memorized.) Or, somehow, my brain short-circuited over the years and it was someone else. But I feel so certain it was him. Not 100% sure if it was in color, but I think it was.				
whatmoviewasthat	1li7avs	1	Apprehensive-Wolf114	2025-06-24T09:05:11Z	Maybe Fantasy Island? Bob Denver was in 4 episodes of Fantasy Island although I checked the subtitle files of all 4 episodes and I didn't find those lines. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077008 There is one episode in Fantasy Island that has a sheikh character but nor Bob Denver nor those lines are in it. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0577835 Do you remember anything else? Was it a full blown, feature-length musical?				
whatmoviewasthat	1li7avs	1_1	Hidingwolf	2025-06-24T15:44:58Z	It kind of felt like it was part of a longer movie or episode. As far as I can remember, I was idly checking the TV for something to kill a little time before I had to leave for something, so that small part was all I saw of it. I think the only way it could have been on The Love Boat was if they were putting on a play or something, and I definitely don't remember any audience watching or any other cues that it was a performance within another context. Thanks for the suggestion, though, I will look at his Love Boat appearances, just in case!	thanks?			
whatmoviewasthat	1li7avs	1_1_1	Apprehensive-Wolf114	2025-06-24T16:15:13Z	Love Boat? You mean Fantasy Island?				
whatmoviewasthat	1li7avs	1_1_1_1	Hidingwolf	2025-06-24T16:38:39Z	Whoops! Don't know why I was thinking you said Love Boat. The Fantasy Island episodes don't sound like they could be the right plotlines, but I will check them out if possible! It did have more of an early 60s-ish feel to it, though and I remember it being pretty minimal/low-budget in sets and costumes, so most likely made for TV. I was just checking out the old 1967 TV movie of Kismet (no Bob Denver, but an Arabian-setting movie musical) and that is definitely not it.

Can you help me remember a horror movie where a family moved into this house (the usual haha). But their daughter went missing until the mother, if I remember correctly, discovered that it's something related to supernatural. � WARNING � SPOILERS AHEAD � MORE KEYPOINTS: 1� They had markings on four corners of a certain spot in the house which will open the door into """"""""that"""""""" world. 2� Something about a Sonograph? 3� Okay, this is a major spoiler so please stop reading if you don't want to know the ending. They were able to go into that dimension where their daughter is, they were running away from the demon and thought they were out of the door and back into the house, but.... they were not. It's an unending loop where they are trapped into that demon's realm.
