1lclj9l	Horror short movie in black and white	Hi! Im looking for an indie Latin American psychological thriller/horror short that Ive seen about 10 years ago. It was hosted for free on a site dedicated to the film, probably made by the director. It was shot in black and white, around 10-15 minutes long, with an unsettling vibe and eerie cool music. I think the title had ~philia in it, maybe referencing a fetish related to surgery or amputation. The story was told from the point of view of a doctor/surgeon who saw himself as a generous, selfless man. He had an MTF trans nurse, a beautiful, cheerful, provocative woman that he called his masterpiece, saying he had done her reassignment and cosmetic surgeries himself. One day, a wounded criminal with a bag of money showed up and threatened him with a gun. The doctor tried to calm him down and offered to help, but the man ended up dead. Other things happened, but I cant remember. (Spoilers from here) The twist was that the doctor wasnt a real surgeon at all. He was a delusional psychopath, maybe a drug addict. The nurse wasnt anything like how he saw her: she looked very masculine and botched from bad surgery, and she hated him because he was threatening to cut off her hormone pills if she ever tried to leave or speak out. The scene with the criminal also played out differently. The man was wounded but not aggressive, he basically handed over the gun willingly. The doctor then shot him and stole his money. Did someone know what Im talking about and ever saw this short?	Horror short movie in black and white Hi!

1lhyhxb	Looking for a TV Show	Hello, please excuse my bad english. I am looking for a action/adventure tv show probably from the 80s, maybe beginning of 90s. I think that it plays on a island. There are 1 or 2 kids in the show. I remember nothing but one single thing from the opening or ending trailer, but I will come back soon to this detail. The show is NOT supernatural and it plays in our time and world. There is always a lot of forest and nature in the episodes. The thing I remember is that during the opening credits ( maybe ending credit but I think opening) there are a lot of scene from the show that are shown rapidely, and one scene is a dragon/dinosaur head sticking out of a lake. I remeber the episode and it is not a real animal (NOT supernatural) but a fake dinosaur machine build by some bad guys to scare off some other people if I remember right. So, in the opening credit there is briefly a fake dino head seen sticking out of water. I thank all of you for your help	Looking for a TV Show Hello, please excuse my bad english.

1ldycnt	Looking for a movie from the 80s (maybe)	I don't remember much of it, but I seem to remember some odd things that took place on a train. It was either a comedy or a comedy horror movie. At the end, the train conductors were revealed to be wax figures, while the song Sh-Boom played in the background. Not much stuck with me, other than the very creepy ending, but I'd appreciate any help with finding it, if possible.

1ljnb9l	1980s made-for-tv horror film	I have a memory of watching a horror film as a child, probably on the ABC network. This would've been sometime in the early to mid 80s. All I remember is a little girl is playing on the roof of the family house, and she falls off. Simultaneously, the mother is in the kitchen holding a watermelon and she accidentally drops it and it splatters on the floor. Quite symbolic. The little girl died. Shortly after, her sibling, I think it was a little boy, is in bed in the dark, and a ghostly shadow figure of the little girl who died emerges at the foot of the bed. It still gives me goosebumps. Anybody have any idea what the film is called?	1980s made-for-tv horror film I have a memory of watching a horror film as a child, probably on the ABC network.

1ld77u6	Help identifying traumatic 80s/90s anime [warning: descriptions of gore]	TL;DR: late 80s or early 90s horror anime where a guy explodes into a bloody super saiyan looking thing with a wolf head sticking out of his shoulder who looks like a red Devilman with no pants which may or may not be a misremembered childhood nightmare& Long version: Not sure if this is the right place to be asking but I could really use some help identifying an obscure anime that traumatized me when I was a kid. This happened so long ago that Im not even sure if it really happened or if I just imagined it. Hopefully this will make sense to someone out there who has seen this too. I was like 10 or 11 years old standing outside a Japanese import shop at a tiny mall in Boston. It was some time in the early 90s before anime got really popular in the US. There was a tv in the shop window playing short promo videos of various anime movies. There was one ultra gory sequence that has scarred me for years and I cant figure out what its from. Ive searched all over Google but I cant seem to track it down. Maybe someone here can help me. All I can remember from the scene is there was some guy standing in a barren wasteland or arena of some sort, who kinda looked like Goku from Dragon Ball, going through some painful transformation; skin tearing in various places, sharp teeth poking through his shoulder, lots of blood, etc. The camera pans to a couple side characters sitting across from him, cowering in fear, (I think it was a girl with a kid, or maybe an anthropomorphic dog-person or something, idk its all a blur). So the camera snaps back to the guy whos now doing the vibrating with rage trope and screaming in agony, blood gushing down his whole body, then HE FCKING EXPLODES into a cloud of viscera and his skin splatters all over the poor secondary characters like a raincoat made of spaghetti sauce. Then the camera cuts back to his feet and it does that slow ominous camera pan upwards to reveal hes transformed into some muscular demon/monster/man thing with a werewolf head sticking out of his shoulder. And I think he was doing the muah-ha-ha Im so evil now! laugh. I dont remember anything after that, probably because I ran away screaming. I kind of forgot about it for a while afterwards. I think my brain repressed it until I was older and something unlocked the memory. I thought I finally found it a couple years ago when I discovered Devilman: The Birth from 1987. The main character looks very similar to what I remember, but he never explodes or grows a 2nd head in any of his OVAs so that cant be it. Does this sound familiar to anyone? Or am I mistaking a nightmare for an actual experience? Seems too specific for me to have imagined it out of nowhere but hell, I have zero proof of its existence so I really dont know anymore. **Final update:** Thanks to everyone for your help but I think its time to give up the search. Theres a good chance this clip is from one of those non-consensual tentacle movies, and trying to find it has led me down some fucked up rabbit holes that I find quite icky and depressing. Rather than subject myself to any more disturbing shit that I really dont enjoy, Im just going to say some mysteries are better left unsolved. Im gonna go shower for a couple days&.

1lgm440	2000s British horror movie	Hello so I've seen this film on the horror channel about 10 years ago. It was a British 2000s horror about this teenage girl with her family and she gets possessed.There is a priest helping but it turns out he was just using her for research or money and not helping. Also when she tried to escape her demon self, she keeps being transported back into the same room that she just left. I also remember her brother getting knocked down by a car and one of her parents ending up in a wheelchair because she refused to be possessed. I've tried looking it up so many times in different ways but it's just hopeless. If anyone has any idea what I'm thinking of, it would be appreciated thank you all.	2000s British horror movie Hello so I've seen this film on the horror channel about 10 years ago.

1kfjtsa	sci fi indie film	Ok so this movie was an indie film from like I dunno, ten years back maybe? The protagonist is like, ex military I think, is an operative, and I'm pretty sure he dies at the end. The United States is divided and he's got to go to California? And California is part of some conglomeration of states, after a civil war has divided the country. He's being guided by an ai the whole time and I seem to remember the ai is voiced by John Goodman (but not sure). The protagonist gets involved with a femme fatale, and the ai is giving him its predictive analysis which normally he goes along with, but decides to ditch it. And then he ends up getting killed at the end, if I remember correctly. Really trying to remember this one... it was pretty good.	sci fi indie film Ok so this movie was an indie film from like I dunno, ten years back maybe?

1lf4kwd	A man that goes crazy in space	I dont remember if it was a newer movie or not, but it's about this guy who goes up to space with his ""crew"" But at the end of the movie it turns out that he going crazy and he's watching camera feed of when he would be fighting with people but it would just show him talking to himself.

1lckt3x	Looking for old cartoon/film: girl with talking panda and potions in square bottles	Hey guys! I'm trying to remember an old cartoon or movie I watched when I was a kid and I can't find the name. I'll list what I remember to see if anyone recognizes it: "" The protagonist is a young adult or teenager, probably oriental (Japanese or Chinese, I'm not sure). "" She has a panda that talks to her (I don't know if it's a magical animal or a talking friend). "" I remember she used potions in square bottles, usually pink. "" One scene that sticks out in my memory is of her near some rocks in a lake. "" It was dubbed in Portuguese. "" I don't think it was Japanese anime, maybe a Western cartoon with a similar style. "" It may have been a drawing or even a game, but I remember it more as a drawing. "" It was something I had on CD, maybe a DVD or old physical media. If anyone recognizes it or has any ideas, please let me know! This memory is a little vague, but these details are what I remember most. It cost!

1lj2c12	80's cop thriller where Japanese detective gets pissed and starts flicking people off	I say 80's film but idk. Probably 80's. Just saw this scene a year back when my dad was watching TV and I know his dumbass will not remember/know what I'm talking about xD There was a crowd of people I think in the parking lot and the detective wanted to do something or say something but was kind of held back by his higher ups. He started to lose his shit and was punching the air and ending up raising his fist/flicking off the Chief of Police to his right, and maybe some media person to his left. Right after he immediately bows to people around him because he wants them to know he's good with them, but fuck the bosses. I think he gets suspended for this. I think I remember the scene after he was on the phone with his boss who was also asian (but they are working in America, maybe in LA). Film seemed like Rush Hour in that it's a cop movie where it has both seriousness and lots of humor.	80's cop thriller where Japanese detective gets pissed and starts flicking people off I say 80's film but idk.

1ldoe8h	Help me find this christmas movie !	I dont have any pictures but i loosely remember the plot,although whenever I google it other movies pop up. The movie is about a wife who lost her memory in a car crash and is staying at her parents house because she doesnt yet feel comfortable with the husband since she doesnt remember him. Its set during Christmas time. At one point the wife sees she had a business she started from home (I think it was something she made herself like handmade products) But the husband is hesitant about showing it to her because its later found out the business completely consumed her time. At one point its revealed that the business took so much of her time that they ,,fell out of love?,, and she was actually on her way to file for divorce when the she got in the car crash. Then she realises how much of the time business stole from her and how she didnt realize how much her husband still loved her and having her around. I watched it a few years ago and loved how cliche it was haha so im hoping to find it again!	Help me find this christmas movie !

I suddenly remembered a movie I saw when I was a teen, all I can remember about it is: Asian movie, child girl main character, she moves in with another family who has a son. she cleans and does alot of shores, at one point the son of the family pees in a vase and she has to clean it up. at the end she might have grown up and marries the son of that family? I think it was an arranged marriage where the sons family would take her in and they kinda use her as a servant untill she grew up. the title might have someting to do with whisper/wind/rain/sound idk, but thats what it felt like the title was. it might have had alot of awards or 4/5 stars and ratings on the cover too.

I think it was a comedy? It certainly was to me and the friend who rewound the scene a hundred times to laugh. I think he was walking quickly after someone. I have a vague idea that the setting is a vineyard or a club or estate, and the plot has something to do with wine? I say Rupert Sewell because I distinctly remember his slight difference in eye size, but possibly conflating the things. I cant find anything when I search so some of the details above MUST be wrong.

They had a boat/ship, and suddenly there was like a pretty huge wave as the father was in the ocean, and the father swept away, and was gone, The kid now goes on an adventure finding his father. There was one scene that the kid had to go into a almost cruise ship or just a regular ship to travel somewhere. Im sorry if the description is not good but this was a long time ago since i've watched the movie, it was almost realistic but more on the animated side.

1le90ye	Horror movie-A kidnapped child is found but is now a vampire or is evil	I watched this movie many years ago, I wanna say early 2000s. All I can remember is the last scene. It's a snowy crowded town and the father of the kidnapped child spots him but as he thinks about approaching him he sees that he's accompanied by the person who took him (a vampire or something). The child is now a vampire himself or is evil. I really want to say the child makes eye contact and winks at his dad or gives him a smerk to show his fangs a little bit maybe? Idk I also have a faint memory of the little teapot being sang sometime in the movie. I have searched for this movie on and off for years and never find it.

I remember a scene where he was sitting on the curb outside his house. A lot of story was around this clean suburban neighborhood. I recall the music being fantastic. I remember he wore a plain white t shirt for a lot of scenes. The female teen lead may have been somewhat famous for 90s/2000s. Was a comedy I think, perhaps a dark comedy, but really great drama scenes as well.	2000s or early 2010s coming of age movie Sorry I don't have much to go on but here it goes...

But at the last moment, they change their mind. It turns out that the man who suggested them to do that ritual/reading actually wanted to lure them into the house on purpose for some killers/vengeful spirits Spirits of 3 teens/ killers (2 girls and one guy) start killing them. There was a lot of singing. I remember there was a scene in the kitche where someone was about to be cooked (?). Also, a scene where a girl got killed in an empty swimming pool with a chainsaw. There was a moment of breaking the 4th wall where the killers sang that they did it all because we, the watchers, enjoy watching at murder. If I remember right, it had 2 parts, but I am not sure. It is a niche movie. The whole movie gave very strong theatrical vibe.

There was a guy trying to get some information from another guy and he straps him to a chair in an almost empty house. He pulls a cord out of a lamp and sticks the two wires to the guys temples to electrocute him. Its eerie because theres no sound when he sticks the wires to his head. You just see him shaking and gyrating around. A scene or two later the electrocuted guy walks into a restaurant and sticks his face under the fountain drink machine and gets a drink of orange juice or something. Thats the best I can recall.

Movie where a character entered a car simulator (real car with big screen ahead) in a dark giant room, and every impact in game would show in real life. I remember that he crashed in game and the impact showed in real life. I think he died and car flipped or got squeezed, can't recall properly. Also, before crashing, I think his steering wheel got disconnected from the car. I have seen this almost 20 years ago, and the movie/series can be earlier as well. I couldn't find it on google and chatgpt and always got suggested other movies with games. No worries if you don't know	Car simulator with impact in real life.

1kkdqha	Looking for raunchy explicit comedy	Maybe 10 years ago I only saw the opening scene and turned it off. It started with a black screen saying something like ""Warning: boobs shown in first five seconds"" in white letters and then literally cut to a close up of a woman's chest and zoomed out as she was running through a forest or a park or something. I think it was one of those early 2000, maybe earlier, slap stick dumb humor comedies like American pie or scary movie. Not totally sure tho.

1lc80yn	Male artist's art comes to life 90s or earlier	I only remember the ending a bit, but the man is an artist and he draws a woman who becomes real and they both walk off together. Not sure how accurate it is since I was undiagnosed adhd back then and a lot of memories are fused and jumbled, but I can see his face and clothing. He's wearing a white tank top with potentially a thin colared shirt on or nearby. Man looks similar to Adrien Brody. Thinner build with stubble. Can't remember what the woman looks like. I watched it on TV not in theaters. Sorry I wish I had more to go on. I think it was around the time I watched mr destiny, it was also on tv, so later than 1990. Curious if anyone else has any clue what movie it might be if it is in fact from just one movie.

I also remember two scenes, one where the serial killer breaks into an apartment where he kills an overweight woman while she was watching TV and the other where he kills a man outside what I think was a cabin, he then breaks into the cabin and kills the mans girlfriend.

1kde98k	Looking for a movie I saw when I was a kid on HBO	So I have only seen few minutes of it. Thriller Probably recorded between 2000-2010. The scene I saw was: autumn, a couple is in a motorboat on a lake, with a shady guy they met a took with them. They have a big house near that lake. It was a darker tone kind of movie. There was probably some murder involved. Never after have I heard of this movie or seen any type of frames or scenes from it. EDIT: the place looked like it could be Canada or USA, it was dark, gloomy, autumnish/wintery vibe. The guy they were having on the motoboat i think he was having darker skin tone and dark long curly hair.	Looking for a movie I saw when I was a kid on HBO So I have only seen few minutes of it.

1lehsvx	Science Fiction movie last seen in the early 2000s at latest	This would have been on cable, and although I might be mistaken, I believe it was a sci-fi original. There were only two main characters, a man and a woman, maybe blonde, who wake up from cryosleep to find the previous shift gone missing. They get infected with something that makes them angry and violent and maybe changes their blood color? There may have been a recovered earth satellite that the infection was on, and at the end of the movie they somehow save the rest of the sleeping crew by coordinating with another ship before sacrificing themselves to stop the spread. That's all I can remember clearly about this movie. Thanks in advance. EDIT: There is a possibility the title had the word Alien, but I don't know if i can trust my memory on the title, as I only ever caught it on tv.

1lagekw	Treasure hunt movie with illiterate character that isn't illiterate	This movie is at least 20 years old and in color. Main character was a boy, 10-14 by my best guess. I think he was blond. For some reason that I can't recall he's part of this treasure hunt with this guy who has a servant (or slave?) who is a black man that is apparently illiterate and is also either dead, mute or both. The treasure hunter trusts this character because he can't read the clues to where the treasure is or communicate with other characters. In the end this illiterate character can actually read and the child realizes it when he sees that the character has betrayed the main character and murdered him or been murdered by him. Someone was definitely murdered. Don't remember who. I also think there was something to do with a goat and a pun about a kid being a baby goat, but I might be conflating two different treasure hunting movies.

1lbzasp	Killer stabbed with a crystal bird feather (possible giallo)	So I was watching The bird with the Crystal Plumage recently and I thought I had seen it before. I could only recall one scene that I remember with almost perfect clarity but as I watched the movie, it became clear that I was confusing it with something else. I have a very clear memory of a movie that ends in a dark room, almost completely black, with a bright red drape or fabric on the floor in which the protagonist and the killer in the movie have a fight. There is a large crystal statue of a bird on a table nearby and the tail feathers can be removed. In the struggle, the protagonist manages to get a hold of one of these feathers and stabs the killer which ends the final confrontation. I suppose that due to the climax of this movie having a literal bird with crystal plumage as a major factor, my mind naturally confused it with the 1970 Dario Argento movie. Did I watch some sort of homage to Bird with the Crystal Plumage or a knockoff movie or something. I feel like I gaslight myself with false memories. Any help would be appreciated!

1k4ylyc	Please release me from this unknown-film prison.	I watched this movie at my grandmas house around 1997 but it could have been out for a while. My cousins and I were far too young to be watching at that time unsupervised. I remember a story about a brother and sister who were for some reason separated at birth or really young. The girl went on to live a semi normal life but the boy was sent to a farm in a remote area with at least 3 creepy evil sisters that all looked the same and also there are abusive and scary farmer parents that adopted him. The sister tries to find the brother throughout the movie. Some highlights that have haunted me: 1. A scene where an animal (a pig I think) is hung up on a hook and bled out into a bucket. The farmer makes the boy watch in horror. 2. There is a big scene or repeated scene where the one of the kids is looking out a window of a moving car as trees pass by. The shot is of the kids POV. 3. The biggest clue. The boy is a little older and for some reason the evil sisters sew his eyes and mouth shut and he is sat at the dining table. I want to say the movie culminates with the sister finding him this way and saving him.	Please release me from this unknown-film prison.

The scene of the movie is a woman in a bathroom and under the bathtub is a sniper rifle where she picks up and shoots at her target. In context, i saw my uncle watching this movie in the mid-2000s in the US.	Sniper movie There is this movie I've been trying to figure out that I saw my uncle watching.

1khrlns	Early to Late 2010's movie about a girl who goes crazy about social media influencing.	I remember getting this movie from redbox when I was around 8 or 9, so all i remember is the basic premise and some scenes. its a movie about a girl who decides that she wants to be an influencer so she comes up with something so she could make herself look good. She breaks into another influencers house and steals her dog so it looks like he went missing. She returns the dog so it looks like she found it, and she befriends her. After that she starts getting more and more influencer connections but also gets crazier and crazier. At the end of the movie i think it was in the desert like just some white mini shack where the main character and the influencer who befriends her drops her as a friend and she freaks out over a charger. Sorry if this isnt descriptive enough, haven't watched it in like a decade almost it feels like.	Early to Late 2010's movie about a girl who goes crazy about social media influencing.

1ldgufp	Looking for a short movie (I think) of a cassette tape that was sentient and attacked someone?	When I was a kid, back in the late 70s early 80s, I remember seeing a short movie (I think, though maybe it was from an anthology show?) of a guy who was attacked by the tape inside a cassette tape. It unraveled itself from the case and attacked a guy, wrapping around him completely and I suppose killing him? Suffocating him? I remember it freaked me out but I have never been able to find it. Anyone remember this or have any ideas?	Looking for a short movie (I think) of a cassette tape that was sentient and attacked someone?

1lc39l3	Grandpa and his grandson?	I only have a faint recollection of one scene. There is an old man, I think his grandpa and a young boy sitting outside in the garden, what seems to be somewhere in tuscany. The grandfather comes out of the house and let's the boy choose the wine they will then drink. The boy gets just little bit in his glass, while the grandpa drinks normally. But before that the grandpa start some kind of speech or wisdom about wine. Kind of like: Wine will always tell you the truth, it can't an wont lie to you, If there is something wrong in the taste, you know it. I think it goes something like that. The boy would be like about 10 or so and the grandpa, im pretty sure, was wearing glasses and a hat. That's really all I have, but maybe someone knows?	Grandpa and his grandson?

1lbn35w	Looking for a movie about two sisters, one gets a needle through her head during a racket game  drama, not horror	Hi everyone, Im trying to find the title of a **full-length English-language drama/romance movie** with a pretty high budget (not a horror film). The main story is about **two sisters**. During a game involving rackets (could be tennis or badminton), one of the sisters gets seriously injured  an **sharp needle or awl pierces through her forehead and out the back of her head** after she falls. Because of this injury, she becomes disabled. The other sister tries to save her. The movie focuses on their relationship, the struggle, and the emotional journey. I remember the scene where the injured sister falls and the needle pierces through her head quite vividly. Has anyone seen a movie like this or know the title? Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

1l6s1k3	Looking for a horror movie I watched as a kid	Hi, I'm looking for a horror movie I watched when I was very young, definitely before 2014. I remember it had two blonde women who I think were sisters, though I'm not completely sure. They were kidnapped (or at least was of them, or they were in a group with other people, don't remember ) and taken to a secluded place, like a cabin or shed filled with tools. One of them was tortured, and I clearly remember the sound of a chainsaw, I'm pretty sure that's what was used to amputate her leg. In the end, the other woman saves her, and they both manage to escape. The scenes I remember most vividly are when the woman who saved the other was peeking through piles of wood plates while the other was strapped and the kidnapper was amputating her leg with a chainsaw, and the injured woman (with the amputated leg) being supported by the other as they walk away together. I've never forgotten that image, but I just can't remember the name of the movie. If anyone knows it, I'd really appreciate the help.

1lj6gr9	Two joggers try to escape a family that kidnapped them	I have watched this movie on youtube during pandemic . Since then wanted to re-watch it but I don't remember its name and now barely the plot. So please help me find this movie =-=-. It was a low budget movie probably independent. There was a man jogging peacefully near some farm until he takes a turn in the woods, following where he finds himself being chased by someone or something. Eventually he finds a woman (also jogging) whom he tries to convince about what he had just experienced. Now the guy must have injured his leg somehow (maybe to some trap while he was being chased) because I remember the girl taking him to an abandoned shed after which she left to call for help and the guy faints . The guy wakes up,bound to a tree, to a family standing along with the same woman. They wanted to kill the man but the woman convinces them that she will kill him (or fuck him whatever) alone. When they left she explained the man that the family uses her as bait to bring other people. The two then try to escape and are being manhunted by the family.I don't remember the chase sequence however In the last scene they both are seen on a truck that they stole and out of that place but it's revealed that the truck has a bomb in it and an explosion is heard while the screen turns black. Additional details - This actress had a different accent and speaking style as if English wasn't her first language. The guy was wearing shorts and was muscular but didn't fight a single guy. All the work was done the the women. The family might have been inbread or some cult, other than that they were farmers Two.

There is one scene I vividly remember where the main character is making breakfast and she looks down at the eggs in the pan which triggers her PTSD as the egg yolks remind her of the aliens eyes. I think it's a relatively low budget production, possibly made for TV. Found! Intruders (1992), it's a mini series. Thanks!	Fried eggs give woman PTSD due to her alien abduction.

1ld84bg	Ive been trying to find this movie for years	it was an old animated vhs my grandma had and i loved it as a kid. this group of fairies live in a forest and go on some kind of quest i think with some other creatures. one of the male fairies has brown hair and plays a pan flute. at some point they end up at a carnival of sorts. along the way they find a dog with his foot stuck in a bear trap, they free him and take him along with them on a boat/raft across the water i think. the main villain of the story is the man/men who trapped the dog. is this ringing any bells for anyone?

1ld7qqx	Looking for this horror movie	It was a movie that happened in a house, there was a secret room that was sort of like a morgue that the teen would find more about throughout the movie. It had a focus on the eyes and the mom was kinda suspicious too. I watched this sometime before 2015 so it can't have came out after that year.

1l4mid5	Erotic Thriller saw on TV early 2000s	UK resident here. Been racking my brain to remember an erotic thriller I saw on channel 5 in late 90s/early 2000s. Woman trying to rebuild after a divorce/husband having an affair. She moves into a new house in a nice neighbourhood. Starts a relationship with her personal trainer. Remember there was a conversation about diet as they pack away food. Turns out trainer is also still in a relationship with an Asian girlfriend who I thought was Joan Chen, but all searches come up nil. Unless I am not looking hard enough... I remember the title didn't scream erotic thriller. Also think there is a detective hanging about investigating a murder or something, suspects husband/ex boyfriend. Might have turned out to be the trainer but not sure about that at all. Stand out scenes include main character having sex with trainer in a toilet stall and slashing the tyres of ex boyfriend/husband.	Erotic Thriller saw on TV early 2000s UK resident here.

1lifg20	Two sisters, one disabled, the other promised her everything&	Hi guys, first time posting on Reddit (I hope this is the right sub to post on). When I was young I watched a film that I often think about. I cant remember the title and Ive never been able to find it searching online. It was quite a dark film, I want to guess it was 90s or early 00s. I watched it similar time to watching the piano. The plot I remember is there are two sisters, one disabled. As they grow up the abled sister promised her disabled sister that she would give her everything in life that she gets too. As they get older the abled sister gets a boyfriend and starts spending more time away from her sister which makes her extremely jealous. The disabled sister then reminds the other sister that she promised she could have everything she has, she then ends up having to sleep with the boyfriend. I think in the end the couple run away from the disabled sister? I hope I worded this well, if anyone can help me with a title that would be great. Ive yet to speak to someone who has seen the film before. Thanks	Two sisters, one disabled, the other promised her everything& Hi guys, first time posting on Reddit (I hope this is the right sub to post on).

1lhtux9	A movie about a chase between a couple and a semi truck.	Before the obvious gets mentioned: it's not Joy Ride, it's not Rest Stop. A couple is driving an American car (I believe it was a 70s Jeep Grand Cherokee or Wagoneer), somewhere in a deserty area in the USA. They stop at a rest stop, the man gets out to go to the bathroom or make a call at a payphone or something like that. Meanwhile the woman stays in the car and gets harassed by a semi truck driver. The semi truck driver threatens her and the woman ends up driving off, with the semi chasing her, and I believe even shooting at her. The man steals a car or asks someone to chase them. It's been over 10 years since I saw this, so details are blurry or non-existent. I hope anyone has their bell rung by this.	A movie about a chase between a couple and a semi truck.

In the end, there's a scene where the guy who got shot is in heaven or has a vision of heaven or something and there's light streaming through his bullet hole. Also the ghost of the guy who fell into hell is seen sitting in the back of a car.	Need help finding a very old movie. It has been decades since I last saw this one so my memory of it is very spotty.

1kdb5u0	Zombie movie from the 2000s	It's basically a zombie movie in which there's a group of teenagers and in one scene around half of the movie, they are in some HS facilities, walking through an aisle I think. I'm pretty sure that also a football field is shown after that. They are obviously scaping from the zombies. Last but not least, I'm also somewhat certain that the movie starts with a dead girl laying on a hospital table naked but with a blanket on, with a forensic doctor doing his work. If I'm not wrong, he then turns around and that's when she wakes up as a zombie and kills him. Although I think it's all from the same movie, I might be confusing this scene with some other film. Considering the filming quality and the special effects I remember, I can only guess it's from the early 2000s, but I could be wrong. I know I'm not helping a lot with the information given, but the truth is that I have very few recollections from it. I didn't own it, only rented, and I watched it only once or twice when I was a kid.

I fear the memory is so distant that I dont have too much information to offer but I want to know if anyone would know this movie. It feels like a fever dream. Ive tried to search for RedBox archives but no luck. We probably rented this when I was 8-12 years old, so that would be 2008-2013, but I feel the movie could be a little bit older (maybe 2000 and so on as it had spy kids-like special fx.) I dont remember many details but this movie was VERY bizarre &amp; probably in the fantasy genre. I assume it was not a theatrical release in the US as I had never heard of it. This was a live action movie with 2 children as the main protagonists, as well as one adult (I think male), and one adult male antagonist. These could have been the same person lol. Now I dont know many details, but what I can say is there is a central carnival theme to the movie, I believe at some point theyre on some sort of carnival ride. The antagonist is a swindler type character. I remember the carnival scenes being vividly colorful. I also remember an outdoor stage setting. Some comparisons that I can draw style wise are Pan, Sharkboy &amp; Lava Girl, Spy Kids, Mr Magoriums Wonder Emporium, and finally&.. what I can REALLY say is similar to the vibe is the Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite scene from Across the Universe. In a different subreddit, someone offered Something Wicked this Way Comes and that is the closest I can find in theme and style, but what I remember is more 2000s goofy/weird and modern. Even Mr Dark seems pretty close to what I can imagine the antagonist is, but that is a little too old and doesnt look like what I remember. Im sure it is not these movies: Cirque Du Freak: The Vampires Assistant, Sideshow, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus Something Wicked This Way Comes	Redbox kiosk rental from 08-12 - Weird live action childrens movie Posting here with hope!

1ke0quc	Can remember so much about the movie except the name	Theres a movie I saw in the early days of Netflix streaming. May have been around 2012. Kind of an indie film. Likely no big names attached to it. It started with a guy in a college dorm walks into a room, looking for a roommate, where there are candles in a circle with one candle in the middle. He blows out the middle candle and finds himself trapped in some sort of Limbo. The setting is like Coherence. Hes in the house, but its pitch black outside, and theres no way out. Most of the movie has him tormented in the isolation. No threats, but sounds and shadows all over to almost make him go insane. The ending involved &gt;!his parents and little sister showing up at the dorm. The candle set up is the same. The little girl blows out the candle and the three end up in the Limbo place and swap places with the guy. He finds himself back and sees the roommate. They both know what happened. They exchange concerning looks and leave the house without saying anything!&lt;	Can remember so much about the movie except the name Theres a movie I saw in the early days of Netflix streaming.

1ljp9e2	I'm begining to believe it was a fever dream	Hi all, I have been trying on and off for years to figure out this movie with no luck, and I'm really starting to think that I either made it up or am completely misremembering it. Here's what I remember * I watched it on TV as a child, so it will have come out before the year 2000 (may possibly be a made-for-TV movie/mini series?) * I believe it took place in the south with some flashbacks between when a character was younger (pre-civil rights), and a more modern time (though it may not have been up to the time the movie itself was made). * Some sort of event or crime happened (I believe it was race-related and may have been a lynching) and was witnessed by a child, and they went mute. * They may have been developmentally disabled in some way (or possibly were just so traumatized that they developmentally stayed in a childlike state) * I believe there was also a family of several women who were taking care of or were friends with this child * I believe I remember there being a tree that was set on fire Let me know if you have any ideas, and thanks in advance for the help! Adding more details in case anyone else goes searching for this, in case this post helps- It's the 1996 made-for-TV movie Stolen Memories: Secrets From the Rose Garden starring Mary Tyler Moore, Linda Lavin, and Shirley Knight. A boy (white, with brown hair) named Freddy goes to live with his 3 Great Aunts for the summer. One of the aunts is mentally disabled due to being almost drowned by a mysterious man when she was very young. The boy befriends her, and she introduces him to her ""friends,"" who are actually the garden flowers. Freddy finds and restores an old blue bike that was originally a girl's bike, and has some trouble with bullies who roll him in poison oak and tease him. As the film goes on, the disabled aunt keeps having flashbacks of the events leading up to her attack. Towards the end of the film, there is a country fair where the aunt sees the mystery man again, who turns out to be a member of the KKK who wanted to kill her when she was younger because she was a witness to a lynching. He tries to drown her again, but she is saved by the boy, her sisters, and the brother of the boy who was lynched (who is also a family friend).

I remember that in the series, they took a group of young people to some sort of abandoned house and forced them to do stuff, but I think they gradually died, more or less in the style of ""Saw."" I think at one point they were playing hide-and-seek or something like that. I also remember that there was a blind girl in the group. I think they canceled it because it was kind of bad and didn't have many viewers, but I need to know what it was called.	not a movie but a tv show Several years ago, I started watching a series.

1l98ec1	A scene where a woman tries to look for an exit in a place that doesn't have one	So, I remember stopping in front of the TV to watch a small bit of some random movie when I was a kid (I can't remember my exact age but I would say this was around mid '00s). All I remember is a scene of a woman in a place where there was no exit (looked like a fancy house or a mansion, not sure) and she went back and forth in a hallway trying to look for a way out. After some time she jumped through something, possibly a big mirror, that turned out to be I think a window and she was finally able to get out of that place. I have no idea of anything else about the movie or how the woman looked like exactly. Googling hasn't resulted in anything. I've just wondered for a long long time what movie that was from and what was the context! EDIT: The scene is from The Avengers (1998)! Thanks u/despereight675309 !

1l6znf2	Sunken ship, murdered woman and mysterious diamonds	US movie, production years 1960s-70s. Every help will be appreciated. A detective interviews a young woman with childhood trauma. It unfolds that the girl witnessed her mother being murdered by poison on board a ship with the intent to steal the loose diamonds that the mother was transporting. The story is set during World War 2. At the beginning of the film there is a scene on a transatlantic liner where two couples are having fun at a dancers and then go to the cabin of one of them, who has a small daughter. Invited to the cabin, the couple kill the couple and at this point the ship is hit by a submarine. An evacuation takes place. The film then moves to the post-war years when the child who survived the ship is now a grown woman. She tries to find her parents killers. She seems to lure the killers through television. In the films finale, it turns out that her parents were killed for diamonds hidden in a doll she had on the ship. I always thought it starred George Hamilton but there is nothing in his filmography that matches this film for me.

The main characters were part of something like a renaissance fair but they jousted on motorcycles. I have no idea what the plot was.	Jousting on Motorcycles?

1l89ca0	Movie where mom looks for missing children in small run down town	A blonde mother( or older sister or aunt) finds out her child goes missing in small poor town with shacks all around where a bunch of other kids have gone missing at the time as well. I don't remember much besides one house of a mother with a drunk husband/boyfriend and son, being suspicious to the main actress. It's been so long since I've seen it so it was released from 2000s-2016, sorry for the large range. The ending was a plot twist where either her child alone or all the other children were found underground/underneath the town through a passage from someone's house. I'm pretty sure she took investigating into her own hands since the disappearances were becoming more frequent and police gave up or she got very little help. The actress looked kinda similar to Naomi watts or Teressa Palmer.

1l6h3b4	80s/90s Era Coming of Age Movie...or did I make this up?!	Hi everyone, I have been trying to find a movie from probably the 90s that I KNOW I watched, but I cannot recall the name. The specific details I remember are that it featured a young teenage girl and a boy she liked, her father was in the military and in one scene, he asked her to pass the chicken breast and she got super embarrassed. Another scene, she got in trouble at school for drawing a naked mermaid, because the boy was going to draw her a picture of a naked man in exchange. I think they burned down a horse barn by smoking cigarettes at one point. Please help me, someone! It was really good and I have been thinking about it on and off now for 30 years. Google has not helped. I think it is an American film as well. Thanks!!!	80s/90s Era Coming of Age Movie...or did I make this up?!

Im hoping someone here can help me find a CGI animated movie I watched many years agoprobably sometime before 2015. Its not a game, trailer, or seriesdefinitely a standalone CGI movie. Heres what I remember: "" The main character was a male with stylized hair, very much like Cloud from Final Fantasy. He was sort of beautiful or cool-looking. "" The style was sci-fi/fantasy, kind of like Final Fantasy in tone and visuals. "" There were swordsmaybe big or energy-style weaponsand at least one motorcycle or futuristic bike involved. "" Toward the end, there was a fight against a big monster. "" It was fully CGI, not hand-drawn animation or live-action. "" It wasnt Chinese or Japanese anime-styleit may have been in English or dubbed. Ive already ruled out: Final Fantasy: Advent Children, Tekken: Blood Vengeance, Appleseed, Kingsglaive, Vexille, Gantz: O, Blassreiter, and Kaena: The Prophecy. It wasnt a trailer either.

1l2kdxy	I only remember a 'spicy' weird scene (nsfw?) . I need to feed my curiosity	I've been thinking about it and trying to find it for years. I believe I was 12 (so around 2012-2013), saw this one scene at night on normal tv. Night, a man giving oral to his girlfriend in an open-ish space (I believe a car with the doors open?), he gets eaten or killed silently, and a creature/monster takes his place in doing the thing. I remember it being a big snake but that never got me anywhere. Keep in mind everything was fairly censored and dark, I don't believe it was an adult movie I thought it was maybe a scene from Splice (2009) but nope. It got stuck with me and for as much as I know the movie will probably suck ass, I need to scratch that itch	I only remember a 'spicy' weird scene (nsfw?) .

They find out that in this castle there is some sort of magical miniature model of the castle with little figures representing the guests, and when you put these figures together in the model, they end up there in real life and hook up.

I only remember a specific scene, but it stuck with me: Theres a young girl Id say around 6 ish years old. She was white and mightve been blonde but I dont really remember. She was trapped inside a cardboard box, and black goop or ooze starts seeping in from the corners of the box. I clearly remember her yelling Daddy! for help as the black stuff got closer. The whole thing felt like a nightmare or a hallucination, or maybe part of a surreal horror sequence. I know it was definitely a movie, my mom used to watch a BUNCH of random movies so she doesnt remember this one and this was also over 10 years ago lol. Possibly a psychological horror or something indie/low-budget. Does this sound familiar to anyone? Ive searched everywhere and cant figure it out. I even asked ChatGPT and if couldnt figure it out either. Thanks in advance!

1ljn088	Old animated VHS tape that kind of looked like Hello Kitty?	I just randomly had a deep memory pop up of a VHS tape we had in the house growing up, but I cannot remember the specifics. All I can remember is that it was animated, late 80s or early 90s, I think it was an anime similar to Hello Kitty with short, cute talking animals. The only story detail I remember is I think everyone was concerned with an egg, and were trying to protect it from getting cracked. I think I remember one character holding onto the egg in a little pocket on their chest for most of the story.

I THINK one of them realizes they are zombies, but his friend says something to the effect of 'I don't care if they're the Swedish bikini team!"" #2 the zombies attack the local church and I can remember them crawling over and out from underneath the pews. #3 the climax / very end of the movie. One of the groups of people we've been following is going to make their escape. I think they are a family of Preppers. There's a little girl say 10 years old or so with blood on her armed with a rifle or a shotgun who comes up to one of the guys in the house and says the zombies are trying to break through the basement. They eventually escape and get in the car with the girl in the passenger seat, she says she needs to get something to eat and the driver tells her she has to wait and squeezes her hand, but then she says ""but I'm hungry now"" and bites his hand, revealing that she had turned as the credits roll.

1l8jnjp	Help little brother find a movie he saw a long time ago	I actually dont think Ive seen this, but my little brother is looking for a movie he says is old enough that credits are on screen during the beginning of the movie. I believe hes thinking 2000s or 2010s. We think its horror, or horror-adjacent. He distinctly remembers that it starts with a truck driving through a field. The most vivid thing he could describe is a scene where two friends go out to shoot a new gun one of them just bought, at a lone tree. One of the men goes to line up bottles or cans for target practice, and when he turns around, the other man is aiming the gun at him and shoots him. My brother thinks there may have been a love triangle with these two and a woman he describes as manipulative and a ho, and thats why the one killed the other. Any help would be appreciated! Its driving him nuts and we cant find anything on Google.

1khb70a	Dark erotic thriller. Not an easy one...	I think I watched this movie in very early 90s. It was an erotic thriller. I feel like it might have had a cheap, TV-movie quality to it, but probably a direct-to-video title due to its seemingly very dark themes. Maybe the picture had a greenish tint? The main character was a dude who had been married to a transgender person without knowing it. Someone at some point in the movie mocked the main character, saying something along the lines: ""How could you not have known? You only fucked her in the ass in the dark? What did she tell you? That her pussy is too tight?"" I think the one saying this could have been an evil, manipulative woman the main dude was now maybe having some sort of affair with. A scene in the movie, I think the final scene, had the manipulative woman call the police and leave the telephone receiver on a table, and then she coaxed the dude to rape her. So the dude commenced raping her while screaming something about how he was raping her, for the cops to hear. Now I feel like maybe there was also a scene where he was in prison after that. Also, possibly, the dude was repeatedly watching and rewinding some VHS tapes for some reason. Possibly some sort of surveillance or session tapes? Memory is very hazy, I might even be mixing this up with a different film here. That's all I recall. I really would like to know what this was, but I don't have very high hopes of anyone knowing this one.	Dark erotic thriller. Not an easy one... I think I watched this movie in very early 90s.

1lcelqn	Help identify two old horror movies.	Hi all! Sometimes I try to remember some movies I've seen on TV like 30+ years ago and there were two films I cannot find till this day. One is some kind of horror where a group of ppl ride the snowmoviles, get in an accident and end in a weird house. Some go for help and dies, others perish in nthe house (remember one being killed by hanging on the fan blades) and in the end there was smth scary. The other is maybe part of some antology where a strange kid had an insect collection - like a church with bugs and one time he fed a girl a cookied with bugs. So I'll be very happy if you help me identify those movies. Need closure xD Thx all! Upd. I've found them, thanks for all the help and responses! The Chill Factor and The Willies.

1l85th9	horror movie with a barbed wire scene	I can only remember one scene, and I believe it is the opening. I'm pretty sure it's either two girls, or one girl and one guy. They're biking through a forest when more and more creepy looking people show up. I can't remember if they're clowns or not but they just look... not normal. These two get more and more freaked out and more and more freaky looking people start chasing them until eventually the two people are so distracted that they bike their faces right into some barbed wire. Every time I have tried to find it, I only get results about Maniacs (2001) or Wrong Turn (2003) these are definitely NOT the movie I watched. I believe I saw it about five years ago and I'm 85% sure that there's a Dead Meat Video on it. I've scoured every video from Dead Meat and I can't seem to find it but I distinctly remember James A. Janisse narration over the scene.	horror movie with a barbed wire scene I can only remember one scene, and I believe it is the opening. I'm pretty sure it's either two girls, or one girl and one guy.

1lb5qef	70s Horror Movie	*found The Sentinel 1977* Looking for a horror movie from the 70s or late 60s. In color, not black-and-white The plot. A family or someone (girl) moves into an old house. -Or it could be someone is admitted into a hospital or even a mental hospital for an extended period of time, but the building is a large old house. But there are a few people she discusses the events with - so not sure if its her family or other inmates. Soon after the female lead discovers there are beings (like shadows or dark beings?) that come out at night. They hide in the walls? In Other rooms? Or parts of the house that have been sealed off? Not sure exactly tbh As usual, no one believes her but one night she discovers or is brought to an old woman that sits in the top attic room of the building. The room is dusty, dirty and dark. The old woman sits on a chair, staring out of the front top window. They discussed something, details of the plot, or what is happening, how the old lady got there (? No idea) etc., and the female lead, either escapes or is let free and returns to the main part of the house. Some type of event occurs where it is believed that the shadow beings are removed and everything returns back to normal but at the last scene, the young girl is now sitting in the chair in the top attic room staring out the front window. Instead of it being dark and musty, everything is white and bright. * it was not Dont Be Afraid of the Dark& Just watched that and its definitely not it&. Any help in finding/naming this long lost piece of cinematic gold is greatly appreciated. Thanks!!	70s Horror Movie *found The Sentinel 1977* Looking for a horror movie from the 70s or late 60s.

A girl and I think a infant got put in a secret compartment in the floor with a shotgun to keep them safe. I also remember a giant hole in the floor and when a few people went into it, it was like thousands of tunnels like a giant ant colony filled with the aliens. I don't remember anything else but that. It also looked set in the desert in the house scene, well that's what I gathered from the dirt and zero trees or civilization.	Movie that just came into my head and now I need to find out what it is.

But I have no idea what else it could be.	0	0	0	1	0	0	39	414	454	6	81	87	12.316666666666666	5.301385542168674	6.3702808988764055	6	NA	NA	1	NA	NA	NA	4	4

1kvg84v	Psychological horror movie about a girl trapped in a box	I remember a lot about this movie but the information is too similar to true crime cases for me to find anything but 'The Girl in the box' and that is not the correct movie. I rented this movie from Family Video about 8 years ago. This movie stars with a young women attending a sex club and going home and with a husband and wife couple, in movie sequence she wakes up in a hallucination/dream sequence in a house where the walls and such are decrepit like an abandoned house but she's in a massive bed with cleanish furniture and there's another girl with her in the room. This other girl keeps saying that 'daddy' and 'mommy' are outside the room and warning her about them, but she's also taking like they've known each other for a while I think. In the start the other girl says something about a door, and the main character says there isn't a door, and then the other girl says something like yeah there is silly look, and then the camera shows a giant door that just appears out of nowhere to prove the dream/hallucination like quality of the scenes In the very end it turns out the main character was being kept in a box as a like a sex slave or something, and eventually she escapes somehow and the big reveal is that the movie takes place when she's in a coma in the hospital after escaping and I think she either wakes up or dies in the end If there's any questions or anything please comment, thank you for your time =O<û	Psychological horror movie about a girl trapped in a box I remember a lot about this movie but the information is too similar to true crime cases for me to find anything but 'The Girl in the box' and that is not the correct movie.

1lcg7ms	Movie where kids help fairies in a forest. I can only remember the final battle.	The film was likely late 90s or early 2000s and followed two children who discovered fairies in a local woodland and had to help them defend their home from some kind of evil creature. Definitely live action. Notable scenes I remember include the parents of said children believing them to have gone missing and deciding to move away or leave so they can stay safe, but are eventually convinced to join the fight. The finale follows the evil creature in the centre of the forest surrounded by the fairies, which are shown as points of different coloured light, and they throw smaller points and beams of light to attack the creature. The film was definitely European or American produced, and likely Direct to DvD. It was specifically not the Fairy King Of Ar. Any help in figuring it out would be super appreciated, thanks in advance.	Movie where kids help fairies in a forest. I can only remember the final battle.

1kmmsub	Trying to find the name of a movie from the 80s (maybe late 70s)	So I remember the opening pretty clearly and saw this movie as a child in the 80s. It starts off with a guy who is walking around some train tracks and sees a turtle. He goes to pick up the turtle when the tracks switch and his foot is caught. Of course, a train starts coming towards him but he struggles and can't free himself. As it comes closer to him he desperately yells ""Stop!!"". The train comes to a stop. The conductor eventually runs out of the train but after some discussion, he says he didn't see the guy and never actually used the brakes (so the train stopped by itself). It turns out the guy who got his foot stuck had special powers to move things. I don't remember much of the rest of the movie but I recall liking the ending. And the beginning has always stuck with me... that image of him stopping the train. Any ideas what the name could be? I searched online and couldn't find anything.

I remember little bits and pieces but one thing I remember vividly is a scene where a little girl puts on a pair of pants her mother had been repairing, and the needle was left in the pants. When the girl sits down the needle jabs her in the butt. I remember very little else about the film other than the fact that it was definitely a tragic story. I believe the girl, (a younger sister) dies of cancer later in the film? I cannot recall if this is implied to be a result of the nuclear bombings of Japan but that seems likely. It is not Grave of the Fireflies.	maybe 13-15 years ago? When I was probably around 12-14 I remember watching an older anime film with with my father.

1ksznid	Movie about detective, who visit a diner two times	Help me find this movie please! I remember part of the plot, but I may have combined two different movies in my head. There was an old man, a detective, maybe he was retired. He was trying to solve a missing person case, maybe a teenager, but nothing worked. In his investigation, he visited a diner where the owner was, or just an employee, and he just had lunch there. The case could not be solved and he abandoned it, or some time simply passed. After 3 years (I have doubts about this detail, because it seems like it could have been in another movie) he returns to this city and in the same diner solves this missing person case, maybe he found out that the whole city was involved. I dug through a bunch of movie collections, checked my old correspondence and sites where I searched for movies, but I found nothing. The only thing that matches the vibe of this movie is Girl in the Fog, it has a very similar shooting and initially I thought it was the same movie, but it didn't have the detail with the diner.

I don't remember the title but know it was an independent film that was shown on either the Sundance Channel or Independent Channel back when they did show independent films.

One of the boys hits this little boy too hard in the head and the kid starts bleeding and acting funny. He then falls into a stall dead and the boys freak out and leave the body. Eventually the kid's parents report him missing and discover his body later on. There was a local child molester or someone on the rejestry that was blamed for the murder instead.

1kkj9u2	Old fantasy movie	I've had the images from this movie in my head for a while but I can't seem to find the movie. It's from an old fantasy movie that I would have watched in the 80's. As I recall, the story is about a young protagonist who leaves on some kind of adventure, maybe to find some lost magic? There's two scenes that stick out in my mind. In one, the young adventurers get picked up by some kind of friendly tribe. They climb up onto a strange transport animal that carries two baskets, one on each side of it's back. Inside the baskets, it was quite nice and cozy and they meet a tiny old wizard or elder of some sort. In the second scene that I remember: as they are traveling, they stop for a break and our protagonist gets out and walks to the water that's next to their rest stop. I believe he sees something in the water? Either way, he ends up falling in and some far off wizard is seen casting a spell that causes him to not be able to come back up to the surface. He's seen panicking and banging on the surface but he can't come up until the the elder that we met earlier comes along and extends his gnarled old wand into the water to pull him out. I feel like the wand is central to the story somehow... These two scenes have stayed with me for decades, the first because those baskets on that animal looked so cozy and it looked like a great way to travel. The second evokes a bit of a phobia in me and I feel like it would be a terrible way to go so it stuck with me. I would love to re-watch a movie that has left me with such long term memories, but I can't seem to find this movie anywhere! I'd appreciate any help in finding it, thank you!

1kckzht	Looking for an early 90's movie about a group of college friends, and a handsome stranger comes to town quoting Rimbaud. At the end of the film, he makes a collage with scraps of his time there in the shape of the United States. (It used to show on Bravo a lot in the late 90's).	I remember seeing this film as I was starting college... it was a sort of comedy, and wasn't very good, but I watched it at a sort of ""formative time in life,"" and ended up discovering Rimbaud from this movie. It showed a lot on Bravo (or the Independent Film channel?), and I remember one of the main characters was a bro-ish doofy friendly guy with long hair, who thought the handsome stranger was quoting ""RAMBO"" not ""Rimbaud.""

1la81vi	Weird scene I saw while scrolling cant find anymore	I was scrolling one day and came across a scene from a movie where there was this scraggly dude yellow teeth the whole southern sketchy dude vibe, and he was driving this girl clearly maybe a hitchhiker or something else. Very different than the dude she wore a dress like a normalish dress with like some small pattern on it. The big thing was that she seemed extremely uncomfortable and the dude kept grabbing her crotch and it seemed like not in a malicious way he seemed very casual just talking while he did it. It cut to them at a motel which looked really rundown etc. I think he asked for a single room but Im not sure. This movie or tv show was filmed fairly recently from the looks of it but set in an older time maybe like 50s 70s possibly 80s although it could be different I just thought that might be the case. Any ideas?

The chess piece queen has to make her decision on making her moves without sacrificing her children or children in general. Anyways, each one who is sacrificed would be taken to the back and executed one by one. You would hear gun go off then silence and back to the chess game. In the end all who was heard being shot were alive. Dont know if the Queen was being tested. Again don't remember exactly.	Human Chess I have asked this question before, driving me crazy.

1lix01k	Looking for a movie I saw as a kid  dad plays a disturbing prank with fake dead kids and ketchup	Hi everyone, Im trying to remember a movie I saw on TV (most likely on TNT) when I was a kid, sometime between the early 2000s, before the 2010 approx. It was probably an American movie, and it really stuck with me because of one very disturbing scene. The movie is about a family  a mom, a dad, and 4 or 5 children. Most of the kids were boys, but the youngest was a little girl, around 2 years old. The family had an old-style Volkswagen van (one of those iconic ones from the 70s or 80s). At one point in the movie, the mom goes to work, and the dad stays home with the kids. While shes away, the dad plans a prank that ends up being extremely dark. He dresses all the kids in white, stages them as if they were dead, and uses ketchup to simulate blood. When the mom gets home and sees this, she completely breaks down, screaming and crying, thinking he has killed their children because of the knife in his hands. Then the kids get up and hug her, and she realizes it was just a prank. I dont remember much else about the movie, but that scene is burned into my memory. I would really appreciate any help identifying this movie. Thank you in advance!

There was like, this ugly looking mutant being smooshy faced (I think), short (I think)guy, and his family members, and they lived together. The main mutant smooshy guy had some kind of super mind control, and controlled his other weird looking family members, I think maybe there were twins (Or just one)? that had super strength, like they all had elevated powers, but I dont remember any of the other powers/characters, but the main smooshy guy was able to control the movements of the other family members, and I believe he made them kill people or something like that. I know theres a lot of blank spaces, and tbh I dont even remember if I saw the entire thing because I fell asleep and was not signed into a tubi account while watching, but I havent been able to find it ANYWHERE, so hopefully someone may have seen this rediculous movie and might be able to point me in the right direction!

1lil55a	Please Help me find this movie!!	I'm trying to find the name for what I believe is a killer shark movie that would have came out around the late 90s to early 2000s, It was shown on TV when I was about 5-6 year ago (around 2006-2007) and I can only remember the first 5 minutes of the movie. I've tried googling it but I can't find it anywheres so maybe someone here will know. Bare in mind that I saw this once about 20 years ago when I was a child so I might not be completely correct about all the details. This seems like a long shot but hopefully someone will know this movie! The first scene i remember i believe is the opening scene, and starts out in one of those sea paddock that has an underwater gate to the open sea and a facility built on top of the water (kinda like the ones they keep dolphins in? But has a warehouse looking building on top), there is railing and metal bridges going over the water. I believe there is a tour of the facility going on and the dialog introduces the facility as a military/private contractor type reseach facility. Theres a bunch of men in swat gear patroling around the water and I think a dummy/food is lowered into water and it gets eaten by whatever is in the water (i believe its a shark trained to kill ppl but idk) Anyways something goes wrong and the shark/whatever is in the water escapes and there's a scientist/researcher who runs to stop the underwater gate from opening via a wheel and he fails to keep the gate closed , thus the shark gets loose. And thats all I remember about the first scene The second scene I remember happens right after the first one, its a time skip to like 10 years into the future where I believe the scientist/researcher who couldn't stop the gate from opening is homeless and living in a box on a walkway by the beach. I believe he's homeless because he tried to warn people about the killer shark/thing in the water and the company fired him/discredited him. And thats all I got. I dont believe the films centers around the scientist/researcher but I think he's an important character that tell the actual main character what's going on with the shark. If anyone knows this film pls let me know! And thanks for your help!	Please Help me find this movie!!

She hallucites going to Tharp and being scared to go into the pool. She was white and the surgeon was black. She endsbup dying on the operation table at the very end of the movie and I'm really trying to figure out what it's called. It may have been on prime video it's been years since I've watched it and I don't think it was very popular.

It was a British (?) assassin type guy with glasses walking through a mansion and killing a bunch of people by shooting through walls. I think there was a squad of dudes in there going after the glasses guy. After shooting a bunch of folks he stops and takes off his glasses, just to then be killed.	British?

1lhe7m4	Name of this old horror movie?	I remember watching just a few seconds of it as a kid in the 90's. There was this red haired, I think female, robot like figure sitting on the bed. Before you say the exorcist, hear me out. She's sitting on the bed but she's kind of facing the door, her back is to the camera. This other woman, human, I guess comes into the room where this thing is and she's promptly unalived. Think she's shoved into a dresser and she hits her head? Then the figure is shown back sitting on the bed and her head makes a robotic like sound when she turns to look back at the blonde haired lady on the ground. Creepiest thing ever and I've never seen it anywhere again. I've never seen the exorcist so if it is it then y'all I'm sorry. Update: I made chatgpt search this particular scene and the only thing that came close in aesthetics is Mirror, Mirror (1990). That's not it though, I looked. Not sure what obscure movie this was but the fact that I can't find it makes it even creepier.	Name of this old horror movie? I remember watching just a few seconds of it as a kid in the 90's.

1khx1se	UFO movie set in the 50s	Looking for a relstively low budget horror movie set in the 50s released around 2019 iirc. The main characters are a teenage girl that works as a phone line operator and a teenage boy that is supposed to be a jock or something and I believe works at the radio station. Throughout the movie there is minor talk about there being an upcoming American football game in this small town and near the end of the movie all of the town goes to this game except the main characters and a small handful of others which allows the ufos to cause a bit of mayhem and abductions without being detect. At one point the main girl plays a tape or receives a call from a man who describes an alien encounter before the phone lines get shut down. Also the main characters go to the house of a ""crazy"" woman who had seen an abductionn and generally they just learn more and more about abductions in the town throughout the movie. At the end the main characters and a little baby run into the woods and get abducted. Thank you.

I'm looking for a movie I am unable to recall where the opening score is this tropical sounding music that may be xylophone or steel drum or something similar to that. I remember it being a really lighthearted fluffy movie like a rom-com or fish out of water story. I thought it was Joe vs. the Volcano but it was not that. It's something similar in tone. The movie closes with the exact same tropical-sounding score. I'm pretty sure it's a movie from the 80s or possibly 90s. Can anyone help me? I can't think of it. Thanks.

When he hands the baby back, the mother discovers the baby has been smothered. This has been driving me crazy for YEARS! It was an older movie if only because I was just a kid when it aired on TV.

The daughter discovered him somehow and started visiting and befriending him. He told her something like her father had killed someone drunk driving and he was the witness/former friend when actually he had done something horrible and the father couldn't bring himself to kill him and the father didn't want whatever it was that the man did embarrassing his family so he locked him away. I'm fairly certain I watched it on Netflix and it was three or so years ago. It was a recently new movie at the time iirc.	Netflix?

1l8en4b	Looking for a teen/adult sex comedy from the 2000searly 2010s	I've been trying to find this bizarre sex comedy movie I saw sometime in the late 2000s/ maybe early 2010s, it could have been made early than that, it was just the approximate year I watched it. It might have been a french film, the version I saw was dubbed in French but my parents used to watch all movies dubbed in french so maybe it was not. It was a long time ago and I was a kid so heres what I remember: The story follows two male virgins, (maybe adults, maybe teenagers), who are trying to lose their virginity, and look like dorks or geeks. One of them is quiet, and the other is louder, both are perverts. The quiet one always wears a bucket hat, which was basically his signature look throughout the film. Theres a scene where the quiet one records his neighbors having sex through the window, and its played as creepy/perverted. Theres a weird visual gag where when they get an erection, usually from flirting or seeing a woman, their penis becomes comically hugelike an over-the-top, CGI-style visual joke. In the end of the movie they both get girlfriends and loose they're virginity, (I think the girls were potrayed as ugly, not sure) The humor was really childish, almost slapstick or cartoonish, but still had very adult content (sex, nudity, etc.). I remember thinking it was kind of dumb and absurd, but its a memory from my childhood I occasionally think about.

1lat8y7	A 3D animation about a little girl going after a garbage truck to retrieve her radio	I remember watching a movie as a kid where the parents of a little girl threw her radio in the trash and she ran after/jumped in the truck to get it back. And when she got there there were furnitures talking and moving. I definitely remember a lamp/street light looking at her and then acting like a lifeless object when she looks at it. There was an old armchair and a furnace with something like a treadmill in front of it. The girl was put on there and she tried to run away. I don't really remember much but i guess her name was Alice. I looked it up years ago and found nothing except a short, german dubbed 144p youtube video but i can't find it again. It might be a 2d but i doubt it. I'm 21 years old. So it's gotta be before 2010-2013 or something.

1lfppio	Movie about time travel scientists who cause a global war - WW3 that is inevitable	I'm trying to name a movie (I think it's a movie, maybe a TV movie, don't think it's an episode of ""the outer limits"" as I searched already for it, and it seems it isn't) about a group of scientists who are attempting to avoid a future global nuclear war - WW3. The basic premise is as follows: Late 60s-mid 70s era movie/tv movie Countdown clock to d-day/doomsday Large screen viewing - I believe the machine itself was tube in shape and most of the set was beige/off white along with the machine The central theme is that the USA has made a time machine and can see the future, by doing so, word gets out eventually, leading to an increasing state of confrontation with the USSR/China etc. The whole thing escalates until they nuke each other. What happens is that, by seeing the future that has a nuclear war, they cause the nuclear war. This movie came to mind, as I just watched ""Paycheck"" with Ben Affleck and it's pretty much a copy of the central idea of this. It may be an episode of a TV anthology style show, but I was so sure it's an old movie. Any help would be greatly appreciated.	Movie about time travel scientists who cause a global war - WW3 that is inevitable I'm trying to name a movie (I think it's a movie, maybe a TV movie, don't think it's an episode of ""the outer limits"" as I searched already for it, and it seems it isn't) about a group of scientists who are attempting to avoid a future global nuclear war - WW3. The basic premise is as follows: Late 60s-mid 70s era movie/tv movie Countdown clock to d-day/doomsday Large screen viewing - I believe the machine itself was tube in shape and most of the set was beige/off white along with the machine The central theme is that the USA has made a time machine and can see the future, by doing so, word gets out eventually, leading to an increasing state of confrontation with the USSR/China etc. The whole thing escalates until they nuke each other. What happens is that, by seeing the future that has a nuclear war, they cause the nuclear war.

1lcamjs	Asian Horror Film	So, im going to explain this really badly... All I remember is binge watching horror movies over 10-15 years ago (I was a toddler). We watched this one film about a detective (I think?) going around trying to solve murders and it ended up being this ghost girl. The only 2 key parts that stood out to me were: 1. Two people walk into a bathroom crime scene, rip open the shower curtain, and this woman's body was folded up worst than a pretzel. 2. Whenever they came face to face with the ghost girl, I remember the subtitles reading ""play with me"" and a wispy, ethereal voice. There was one particular scene like that she was sitting on top of a well or a short wall or something, all I remember is it was foggy and very blue. Again, sorry for the vague descriptions, all I have to my memory are these 2 images and not much to go off. I accept I could be mixing movies too because I was so young at the time. Either way thanks in advance for any suggestions!	Asian Horror Film So, im going to explain this really badly... All I remember is binge watching horror movies over 10-15 years ago (I was a toddler).

1l8l7wa	Horror movie from the 80s? (was on vhs)	Trying to find the name of a movie I watched in the late late 80s or perhaps very early 90s. Details are fuzzy, and I dont remember a lot of it but hopefully someone recognises it! A young couple, I dont recall them having kids, move into a house with a terrible black stain on a wall, they paint it and the next morning its back again. There are other paranormal happenings but the other that I recall and really terrified me was a ghost thing raped the man. It was allegedly based on a true story. I dont recall any actors or anything, though Im pretty sure it was a standard American accent. Im pretty sure it was all or at least mostly set in the house. I think it was 2 storeys but thats about all I can recall. I have googled and got several results but none of them looked right. Im guessing I was around 8 or so when I watched it and it scared the bejeezus out of me lol. Thats what I get for not listening to my parents I guess ># I wonder if Id still think it was terrifying.

The movie starts in a bar where a girl comes and wants to get a job, she is hired as a waitress. Then after a few minutes there is some shooting and that's it. That's all I remember.

1lb636e	Trying to Find an Old Black &amp; White Film I Saw Late at Night - Just a Bunch of Men Talking in a Tavern 3/3	Ive been trying to name this for years. I saw it sometime between 2008 and 2012, late at night, one of those things you watch just because nothing else is on. It was black and white, definitely an older movie. What I remember is a bunch of men sitting around drinking, in a place kind of like a tavern not a bar, more traditional. The movie was mostly just dialogue. There was this one guy talking about how much he missed his girlfriend or wife, and he kept saying how even though she had small boobs (I know), he loved her so much and missed her like crazy. It stuck with me for some reason, maybe because I have been trying to name it. I didn't even like it that much but it's eating me away. Please help.

1lilhzw	Movie Trailer I Saw When I Was Younger That I Want to Remember	So there was a movie trailer that I saw that played before another movie on dvd (I cant remember this movie at all so it doesn't bother me). The trailer includes a scene of a girl in a classroom talking about a creature or something that stays in the darkest corner of your room. There is then a scene where she is in her room at her desk and she turns and looks at a dark corner. The only other thing I remember is that the girls face is taken off. I want to remember the name because it scared me as a kid. I probably saw this in the early to mid 2010's, but there is a chance that the dvd I was watching was a movie from the 2000's.

1lk76vp	Trying to find a surreal thriller/horror(?) I half-watched as a kid  dreamlike bathroom, mysterious hole, maybe a murder	Back in the early 2010s, I caught part of a late-night movie at my cousins house. I didnt finish it  I was a kid and got scared  but Ive never forgotten how weird it was. My memory might be a bit fuzzy, but heres what I remember: The main character (a guy) was in a surreal, dream-like bathroom space  almost like a hallucination or flashback. Things turned disturbing there, possibly including a violent encounter with another man and something involving broken glass. Then it shifted into a scene where hes either chasing or running from someone through a shallow marsh or freshwater area, with tall reeds everywhere. The whole thing had a very fragmented, disorienting feel. Eventually, he kind of wakes up and realizes hes kneeling on the ground near a hole. Inside the hole is a man's head  and it somehow ends up in his hands. There were some law enforcement figures nearby who thought he was responsible. He looked panicked and scared out of his mind. The movie seemed to jump around with edits and flashbacks. What always bothers my mind is the memory of a bloodied man in a yellow shirt, lying in a boat or a barrel, also missing his head (might as well be the owner of the head). Thats all I remember. This could very well be a mix of real scenes and childhood confusion. Still, Id love to finally know what this movie was. Any ideas?	Trying to find a surreal thriller/horror(?)

I would say from the 70-80s probably. It was about a young group of boys who were related to mafia or some kind of dirty work. There was a scene of a young man standing outside his car. I think his car shut down in the middle of a highway. He was young and had kind of long, brown hair. There was also a girl with him and she told him she was pregnant with his child. Then he looked at her and asked her what are they going to do because they were too young. That's all I could remember. I would be really happy if I could find this gem again!

1kuc4h4	What is this film	Kids fantasy film I remember watching this film with my brother a year ago (?), and i remember that there was two children who were siblings, and they fell down a hole in the floor of the boys bedroom (they were in a new house) and they fell into a cavern with armadillos (?). I also remember there was something to do with marble, i think. My brother insists there was a white gas and Chris Pratt starred in it. He also says there was floating hands in a castle where they fight the white gas. Please help, my family is tearing itself apart lmao. There was also a one-armed robot and a dragon apparently. EDIT: We saw it in the cinema so it was quite recent, probably late 2023 to early 2024.

1ler0g8	80s/90s Future Dystopian World with just Androids	I remember seeing this movie as a kid back in the late 90s but it had been out for some time already. Basically, humans created androids to fight their wars and then the androids wiped them out. The plot follows a solitary android whos searching for something. He comes across a village of other androids thats run by a few different bully factions. Water is a huge commodity, if I remember correctly. One of the baddie factions is just three identical, female androids who are dressed in all black and wear sunglasses. There arent any guns left but everyone has these cyber daggers that activate when unbuttoned from their harness and seem to propel themselves at great speeds when thrown. There was a female android bartender, also, who was walked all over by the other androids. There was another side character who got decapitated early on and is constantly searching for a better body. I think the main male character was a British actor but could be mistaken.

1l8lxwa	Two brothers, a struggling writer and a priest in a wheelchair, who turns out to be the Antichrist.	Release date: 2000-2015. Country of origin: Unknown, it was dubbed, mostly Caucasian actors. --------------------- At the beginning, various accidents make the life of the priest difficult and eventually a group of ragged-looking humanoids besiege the house the priest lives in. The audience is lead to believe that these beings are demons but in fact they are angels, trying to destroy the nascent Antichrist. They manage to get to him and they try to crucify him (not sure) but the writer-brother intervenes and saves the priest. Later the priest - having woken up to his own real identity - murders his writer-borther (with a dagger?), takes his unfinished manuscript (diary?), finishes it and declares it as the sacred text of a new religion. The last shots show the priest (now as the Antichrist) ushering people inside a temple as he's about the give a sermon from the book of his late brother. --------------------- Some tidbits: The number 11 might have been significant. Maybe there was a time-limit on stopping the coming of the Antichrist (11 PM?). Maybe there is a scene set in a cemetary where the father of the two brothers, tells the writer-brother to protect the priest at all costs. --------------------- It's not: Black Circle Boys (1997) Dark House (2014) Lost Souls (2000) Megiddo: The Omega Code 2 (2001) Midnight Mass (2021) Shelter (2010) --------------------- https://www.gyakorikerdesek.hu/szorakozas__filmek-sorozatok__13033740-egy-film-cimet-keresek-roviden-egy-paprol-szol-es-egy-iro-testverrol-aki-proba	Two brothers, a struggling writer and a priest in a wheelchair, who turns out to be the Antichrist.

1kn7yai	Woman musician with a blonde shaggy cut is r*ped, it impacts her life tremendously	This movie would likely have been out in the early 2000s. The main character is a woman with a blonde shaggy haircut. I can hear her voice singing a song in my head, but I cant place the words. It might be something like the anger lies in you but my memories of this are so vague. Her voice is very Mazzy Star like. She is a rape victim and I believe the movie centers around her struggles to cope and move forward. I remember I bought it on VHS for five dollars from a Walmart bin. I really wish I had more to go on.	Woman musician with a blonde shaggy cut is r*ped, it impacts her life tremendously This movie would likely have been out in the early 2000s.

1kgigwj	gangsters, shotgun peephole scene, scared highway cops, tall bald silent guy, a fight with gangster girls, and a prison ending	Hey everyone, Ive been trying to remember the name of this movie I watched when I was a kid, about 10 years ago (so probably early 2010s or late 2000s), and its been stuck in my head for ages. Heres what I remember: * The movie starts with a guy holding a shotgun and knocking on the door of a house full of gangsters. When someone inside peeks through the peephole, the guy shoots him straight through it. Very intense opening. * The main characters were either two or three friends. One of them was a tall, bald guy who didnt speak or said very little. He was the intimidating, silent type. * Theres a scene where two cops are parked on a highway. One of them starts to turn on the siren, but the other stops him because they realise the cars going by are filled with gangsters, and the cops are scared to get involved. Its clear that these gangsters run the road. * Theres also a memorable scene where a group of gangster girls shows up, and the main characters end up fighting them with guns. * The film has a gritty, violent, and intense vibe. Im pretty sure it was in English and likely American-made, maybe a crime or action movie. * At the end of the movie, the bald guy who barely spoke gets sent to prison. After a time skip, hes bailed out, and thats when the movie ends. I watched it sometime between 20122015, but it could be older than that.	gangsters, shotgun peephole scene, scared highway cops, tall bald silent guy, a fight with gangster girls, and a prison ending Hey everyone, Ive been trying to remember the name of this movie I watched when I was a kid, about 10 years ago (so probably early 2010s or late 2000s), and its been stuck in my head for ages.

Young guy (high school or college age) with low self-esteem gets rejected or broken up with by a girl and tries to burn himself in a tanning bed. His friend pulls him out and says something like ""why are you being so stupid?"" and the guy responds something to the effect of ""I deserve to suffer"". It was a relatively minor part of the movie.

Might have been a comedy.	1	0	1	0	1	0	57	409	467	11	79	90	4.790909090909089	4.825617283950617	5.653043478260873	3	2	3	1	1	0	2	1	1
1kffy6l	help me find this movie	Hi all, I've been trying to find out the name of this movie for years, but had no luck yet. In the year 2000 my mother made me watch a movie with her, I still remember clearly some scenes, but nothing else.. The whole plot was around a ghost mother (or maybe she was alive?) throwing her son off a cliff in the sea, or maybe she jumped in with her son.. This event happened every year, periodically, on the same day, and I remember there was someone that was watching this happen. I also remember a scene where someone wakes up staring at the ceiling, in a room full of candles, and there was someone watching him/her right above his/her face. I'm sure though, the movie revolved around the ghost jumping in the sea with her son/throwing him in, every year on the same day. I'm sure I've seen the movie not after the year 2000, so it's gotta be a movie older than that. Help me please, it's been bugging me for years :)	help me find this movie Hi all, I've been trying to find out the name of this movie for years, but had no luck yet.

1kuntrq	Time traveler movie I saw years ago	Hello all,This is my first time on this subreddit. Ive been searching for this movie on which a trailer I saw years ago but I never got around to watching it. So basically theres this man, hes with some kind of top secret organization that has discovered time travel. With this new breakthrough they assign him to travel back in time to investigate the bombing of a train, and who is responsible. Each time he times travels he has a limited amount of time before he is sent back(I think 8 minutes to be exact) back to his hq before he is sent back to continue his assignment. Along the way he runs into this woman, and he ends up falling in love with her then gets completely derailed from his original mission. He then has a personal goal of saving said woman and finding out whose behind the bombing(Im not sure how this movies time science works so i dont know if changing something in past directly impacts the future but Im assuming it does) thanks!!

1lim7xd	Early 2000's Family Movie	Hi all, I could really use some help figuring out what movie has been stuck in my brain for the past few days. I remember watching it as a kid, it was one we rented from Blockbuster, in the early 2000's. It was a family movie and was a cute, sweet, and clean comedy. It was about a family of four - a mom, dad, younger son, and teenage daughter - who had a family restaurant. I think it was a pizza place, but I remember that the whole movie took place at the restaurant and it was opening night. The big scene that I remember was too the end. The teen daughter's crush was eating at the restaurant and some how had his food over spiced. His mouth was on fire and he climbed up on the table and breathed on one of the fire sprinklers in the sealing. That triggered the fire alarm to go off and all of the sprinklers to turn on. He cooled down his mouth with the sprinkler he breathed on.	Early 2000's Family Movie Hi all, I could really use some help figuring out what movie has been stuck in my brain for the past few days.

1l6bxfq	Early 2000s (french?) comedy	I've seen the movie years ago and I can't remember the name. The main plot point was that there were 2 brothers - one of them was a priest in some small village and the other was a gangster in some crime organization. The former just as the movie starts finishes his 20 something year sentence for a robbery (?). He has a bunch of valuable gems stashed away somewhere but can't get them for some reason and because of that he sends his brother to do that for him and do a deal with some mob family. While the gangster's brother is away he impersonates a priest and tries to stay low and not reveal his past to anyone. I remember crying laughing at some scenes and it would be awesome to have a chance to see it again. Edit1: Now that I thought about it I'm very confident it was a french movie.

1kfsztt	I can't find this movie (not even with AI)	The protagonist is a normal guy who watches people walk by on the street and writes stories. I don't remember exactly if he writes, but he is curious about other people's lives. Scenes I remember 1. In one scene he's in a cafe I think and a thief sits next to him asking him what he does. 2. Ok I remember this thief wears gloves, not leather ones, but white latex ones. 3. He invites the protagonist to enter other people's homes, not exactly to steal, but to observe other people's lives. 4. This thief breaks into a woman's house and finds a pair of earrings and steals them, but ONLY one, just to annoy her. 5. The thief tells the protagonist that he found a new house to break into, this house is the protagonist's house but he acts like is not his house. Basically in this scene the thief makes fun of this guy's lifestyle. 6. Almost at the end of the film, the thief tells the protagonist to rob a place, but in the end it was all a scam.

1k65aka	Possibly 80s/90s sci-fi movie. Look like a post-apocalyptic setting. One scene I recall were bot-like creatures (or aliens?) chasing people who were outside and killing them instantly. Something along the lines of Hellraiser flying orbs. And people trying to run back inside for safety.	Edit: Can't edit title but I meant Phantasm flying orbs not Hellraiser. I think it would classified as sci-fi than horror. It's definitely not Phantasm, Aliens or Tremors. I'm pretty sure it came out before 2000. I don't recall much because I saw it many years ago on cable. I was flipping through channels when it was on and didn't watch it from the start. I think there was a love interest that came later (or blossomed later) in the movie.	Possibly 80s/90s sci-fi movie. Look like a post-apocalyptic setting.

1ljzcbm	Trying to find out a old movie about the young boy and old man in sea	Hi, Im trying to find a live-action movie I saw on Australian TV many years ago. I only watch a little bit of the movie on TV so I don't have a lot of information. The movie is probably from the 70s, 80s, or 90s or early. It featured a young boy and an old man going on some kind of sea adventure possibly involving a boat, maybe treasure or a quest. The movie was in English. It was probably American or European movie. The story might be set in a fantasy world and medieval tone. The most scene I remember is this: * The old man suddenly seems to hallucinate, he's playing cards with people who aren't really there, and at some point, the old man seems to be tired and his body is slowly collapsing (start to look skeletal or zombie) * The hallucination ends when the young boy shouts and shake him or wakes him up. * The old man seems to be happy and appreciated for what the young boy did. Whats sticking in my mind is that the movie title might have been the the old man's name or something like ""the adventure of..."" or ""wonderful of..."" in the title. I could be wrong about this. Any ideas?	Trying to find out a old movie about the young boy and old man in sea Hi, Im trying to find a live-action movie I saw on Australian TV many years ago.

1li3o2k	Sci-fi alien interview	This may be a short film, Ive only seen a clip of it a while back, but it looked recent (within at least the last 20 years) and high quality that makes me believe its closer to the last 10 years. My memory is vague so some things may be off: An ordinary man and an alien are having a discussion in a room, sitting down at a conference table. The alien is almost completely hidden in the dark, with maybe only his eyes being visible and maybe a vague outline shape of his head. The human is in the light and can be seen. Both seem calm and the human is interviewing the alien or at least just asking questions. I believe the questions are around alien technology, how is the alien able to understand him and communicate and possibly even philosophical questions like the meaning of the universe and life. The alien tries to answer all the questions, but I think for some, he says he cant because the human wouldnt be able to comprehend. I think the clip I saw even has the alien saying something like youre asking another question that I cant answer as if maybe they already had discussed certain questions cant be answered or at least that he may not be able to answer every question. Ive looked everywhere for this and starting to believe that it may not be a full length feature film and must either be a short film or something. Does this sound familiar to anyone? (Just as a heads up, Ive been suggested that it may be Arrival (2016) and can confirm that is not the film).

They enter the airport and the movie plays out with the cop group trying to survive and protect the man and also the mans wife who is there. There is one main cop guy who ends up solely protecting the man. A lot of people are killed throughout the movie its pretty bloody. The main cop lady ends up being the leader of the bad guys group. They make the man record some sort of confession video to post online. The movie ends outside of the airport where the bad guys try and blow up a plane or the airport? Not sure of much else.

1l66x7p	Battle droid (maybe)	I apologize in advance if this has been asked/answered before. I did try searching with no luck. Maybe my searching skills arent good enough. I am looking for the name of a movie that is probably at least a couple decades old. Possibly 1980s to 2000s. I recall the movie as being in an urban school setting. The main character was a young adult male. I have the impression he was a teacher or substitute. He believed he was a battle droid built by a brilliant inventor. I recall two scenes. In the first scene, a group of violent male teens is in a car. The main character stealthily hooks a chain to a car door handle, crawls under the car, hooks the other end of the chain to the car door on the other side, then stands up and tosses a grenade in the open car window, and walks off as the car explodes. In the second scene that I recall, another man notices a bleeding scratch on the main characters neck, and realizes/deduces the main character is not a battle droid, but rather the brilliant inventors biological son. Thats how I recall it, but its been a long time.	Battle droid (maybe) I apologize in advance if this has been asked/answered before. I did try searching with no luck.

1kclkys	help me to find the movie please	Help me find a movie where a group of friends went on a tour across Europe, but their money was stolen on the train. Years later, when they found out that one of their old friends had died, they reunited for a trip because that was the only way they could inherit the deceased friend's belongings. There's a scene at a big party or festival where they sold their friend's ashes disguised as cocaine to earn money for the road. They also visited Romania, Paris, and Amsterdam, if I'm not mistaken. Another detail is that they bought a strange drug that made them see weird things.	help me to find the movie please Help me find a movie where a group of friends went on a tour across Europe, but their money was stolen on the train.

I could try to get a better screenshot from the video, but it's pretty rough. lol	0	0	0	1	0	0	30	443	474	6	81	87	6.416666666666668	7.642585365853662	8.303545454545457	8	NA	NA	1	NA	NA	NA	5	5

1kkgxr6	Been wondering what this movie is for at least 2 decades	I was watching this horror (I think) movie on TV when I was a kid, probably between 2000 and 2005. Shortly after starting it, my dad asked me to go out and rake the leaves and help out with other yard work. By the time we were done the movie was either over or I couldn't find it on the TV again. But the beginning has stuck with me through the years so hopefully someone can help me out and give me some peace of mind! So the movie takes place at a carnival, or at least the beginning did. Think there were a bunch of kids that were visiting the carnival that were meant to be out protagonists but I don't remember anything about them. The thing I really remember is that the carnival owner is trying to get his star attraction to stay but she's not having any of it. She's going to move to LA to become an actress i think. Before she leaves for good she enters a funhouse or a haunted house attraction to meet her boyfriend or someone I think. However there's this sarcophagus that they've set up here that's new. I think it was supposed to be their new big attraction or something. In not sure where they got it from but it ends up being haunted or cursed and this girl ends up getting sucked into or dragged into the sarcophagus. I'm not sure if it was via mummy bandages or if hands grabbed her or not. Feel like it was bandages but I honestly can't remember. After that I don't know what happens as I got called away. It definitely had an 80's B- movie feel to it. My googling over the years hasn't helped me figure out what this movie was. Turns out there's a lot of movies about carnivals and sarcophaguses (which just leads me to mummy movies) Does this sound familiar to anyone!? EDIT: I'm pretty positive the movie is Ghoulies 2! The scene in question was one of the carnival workers preparing to leave the carnival but had to find her cat first. She didn't get sucked into a sarcophagus like I thought but she did stick her hand in one that one of the Ghoulie then cut up. Then they jump her and do what Ghoulies apparently do. Could have sworn the scene ended with a close up of the sarcophagus as it finished sucking her into it but the rest of the scene is so close to what I remember that I'm thinking I got some details wrong. Thanks everyone! And for anyone that thought it might be a segment to a show like Tales from the Crypt or So Weird, that was a good idea! I never considered that i was having so much trouble due to it being a smaller segment! But I do think it's Ghoulies 2 in this case. Thanks for all your help!

1kjy54t	Movie/show about a girl who has magic sneakers that make her run really fast	It was something like Teen Witch or Sabrina the Teenage Witch. I remember the girl wasn't very old, I think she had blonde hair and wore it in a ponytail for this scene and it took place on a race track (for runners not cars). She started the race running at her normal pace, but the others were playing dirty. She got tripped up by the other competitors and fell behind in the race. I remember she was bent down like she was tying her shoe laces and said a spell of some kind and her shoes had a life of their own. She started to zoom around the track like a roadrunner. This may be from another film but I remember a scene where they're at the prom and the mean girl comes up to her and is throwing insults. But she turns her into a dog, I think it was a white poodle or something similar. This may not be the same film but I know they both involved a witch/magic.

1ldax64	underwater sci-fi movie	so I recently saw a scene of a movie and I can't get it out of my head. The scene took place underwater in some sort of research station or big submarine and there were 3 people: a man, a woman and a little girl (I don't remember if they were a family but I think only one of the adults was the girls parent). they were in a room that was big, rounded and empty (no control panels or similar things) and one side of it was a big window. The adults left the room and the girl looked out the window (you could see only solid blue outside). Then the monster appeared. (after this my memory fades) It was either a big fish or just the eye of a monster and the girl and the monster watched each other for a moment before it swam away (it could have cracked the glass or hit the station). Then the adults came back into the room. From the quality and design it looked like it came out in the last 10-15 years but I could be wrong there.	underwater sci-fi movie so I recently saw a scene of a movie and I can't get it out of my head.

1k6vm91	I need to find an adventure movie from years back	Sadly I remember very little, only 3 key details. I know it is very Indiana Jones esque, so it is a treasure hunt of some sort for an artifact/place. There is a scene near the end where they enter the cave system, and one of the bad guys goes into the wrong direction and gets eaten by a giant spider. And the main bad guy dies via being pushed into lava as he fights the protagonist while everything crumbles around them. I know that is very little information but I sadly don't remember anything else from the movie, it is just really nagging me.

The only part I remember is this lady and a guy walking into some place at night and going through a parking lot when all of a sudden a car backs into her and almost hits her. She was being harassed by some spirit/demon or whatever and she was trying to get help. I think she was pregnant but I'm not sure. And also I believe the guy was filming the whole thing, making it a found footage film. At first I thought it might've been a Paranormal Activity movie but I rewatched them and didn't find that scene in any of them.

1lcqocg	Siberian gulag, Polish nobleman, bodies hidden in a coffin - searching movie	I'm looking for a movie (I watched before 2009) - a color, not B&amp;W. The film is set in the 19th century. The main character is a Polish nobleman, well educated and French-speaking. He is arrested by the Russians and sent to Siberia. His young wife goes to Siberia after some time to be by his side. In the gulag, she helps the head of the colony by teaching his children or looking after them. In time, she gives birth to three children, but they all die - probably of typhus. After the death of the third child, he asks the warden for a cart and an escort soldier to transport the child's body in a coffin. In reality, she hides her husband in the coffin. At night she secretly feeds him while the soldier sleeps. They travel for a long time and arrive in a town (probably in Turkey or with oriental architecture). Thank you in advance.

1l78h7x	Movie from Psychology class	I watched a movie in Psychology class between 2001-2003. The film looked older (maybe 80s). I remember the teacher giving high school students different color armbands to wear. I believe some had brown and others had blue (or maybe it was green and blue). Either way, the kids with one armband color got privileges that kids with the other armband color did not. Without the kids knowing, the teacher was teaching them a lesson about how easy it is still to brainwash and manipulate people into behaving a certain way. Near the end of the film, a couple of the kids try to bust into a secret meeting. As they do, the teacher shows the brainwashed kids images from World War 2 that shows how the kids are acting the same way. The details are all a little fuzzy given that I watched this only one time over 22 years ago.	Movie from Psychology class I watched a movie in Psychology class between 2001-2003.

1lgbcvs	Cold War Family Drama	This movie would have been made in the 80s, I think; early 90s at the latest. It takes place in Nevada, I think perhaps Reno, a plot element is the father's obsession with nuclear tests, and an upcoming test will be visible from town. The family consists of two kids, their parents, and a disruptive aunt who comes to live with them. The father has ptsd from the war, drinks, and is volatile.

Cold War Family Drama This movie would have been made in the 80s, I think; early 90s at the latest. It takes place in Nevada, I think perhaps Reno, a plot element is the father's obsession with nuclear tests, and an upcoming test will be visible from town. The family consists of two kids, their parents, and a disruptive aunt who comes to live with them. The father has ptsd from the war, drinks, and is volatile.

1lfku3f	Movie about a black ""Karen"" and karma	Looking for a movie I saw a short clip of on Facebook. In the clip, a young blonde girl is trying to get to her seat in first class on a plane, only to be yelled at by a Black ""Karen"" who thinks the white girl (who I think is named Celina in the movie) is not old enough or rich enough to be in first class. After a short argument, the flight attendant checks the white girl's ticket and confirms that she does have a first-class seat  and they are actually seated next to each other. Later, the Black woman is shown being greeted in an office by an older white man named Bob, who welcomes her to her new job as head of marketing (I think that's the job title). Bob gets a phone call and tells ""Karen"" to wait in the lobby  hell be right back. Of course, sitting on the couch is Celina. ""Karen"" accuses her of following her and tries to drag her out of the building. Just then, Bob comes back and greets Celina warmly. ""Karen"" freezes in disbelief. After that, I dont know what happens  and I cant find the clip or the movie again	Movie about a black ""Karen"" and karma Looking for a movie I saw a short clip of on Facebook.

1kfn4hm	Movie or miniseries with hit and run (more details in text)	Im hoping someone can help me identify this. It ended on a cliffhanger and has bothered me for years. In the early 2000s I think, I saw a movie or miniseries where a woman hit a child with her car (white suv maybe?), killed her, and fled the scene. The woman driving was a Caucasian brunette and knew the child she killed. She tried to go about business as usual while the investigation was ongoing, while keeping an ear to the ground. She played dumb with her family and later a friend, who shared some rumors she heard about the investigation. Somehow, she obtained a piece of jewelry, belonging to said friend (gold earring maybe?) and pocketed it. Later, a detective (a Black pregnant woman) approaches the woman who committed the hit and run for what seems like a friendly chat. She tells her everyone assumes the driver was a real bitch, but she thinks the driver probably got scared. Our villain still plays dumb. After that, we see the detective at home with her husband, chatting about the investigation. She tells him she knows who killed the child, but doesnt have enough proof. She says she knows the woman made a mistake, but as she is about to become a parent, the case has affected her personally and part of her wants the woman to suffer. She asks if that makes her terrible and he says I dont know. We then see the driver at the scene of the crime. She has snuck past the crime scene tape and is sobbing. She throws the jewelry into the nearby woods, framing her friend. There was a to be continued placard and&thats it. I never saw the rest. Anyone know what Im talking about? Anyone know what happened? Im pretty sure the accents were American, but feel like I saw it abroad.	Movie or miniseries with hit and run (more details in text) Im hoping someone can help me identify this.

1l6s7y0	Spanish or Italian Coming of Age Doppelganger Movie	Trying to find this movie I saw in college (2015 - 2019) about a teenage girl who meets a boy on the street who looks identical to her. Over time, she befriends this boy and introduces him to her father so that he can take the brunt of his affection and abuse. The movie takes place in either Spain or Italy, with a summer-y feel to it. It's a sad ending, with the boy maybe running away and the father's abuse escalating as a result. In my memories, the girl is played by Dafne Keen but she would've been too young at the time, the actress likely just looks similar to her now. I remember the dad being Jordi Mollà but again, nothing like this movie is on his IMDb page. The movie poster was blue with the girl and boy's heads facing in opposite directions, highlighting their similar appearance.

1kku3li	Apparently NOT an Arnie Movie!	I remember watching this crime/comedy movie as a kid. I think it was a 90s film. I thought it stared Arnold Schwarzenegger, but I looked at his filmography and I can't find it. I remember it being about a group of robbers. They are visited by a preteen boy who claims to be The Arnie guy's son. He helps them look after themselves around their hideout. Classic 90s premise. ""Tough guy has to learn how to be dad!!?!?"" The scene that lives rent-free in my head is when the Arnie Guy is brushing his teeth, but he realises it's not his toothbrush. The kid explains he replaced it because you are supposed to swap your toothbrush every six months. The tough arnie guy mumbles who he preferred his old brush because it was softer. This scene has haunted me for years and I've never been able to find the film! Thanks!	Apparently NOT an Arnie Movie! I remember watching this crime/comedy movie as a kid. I think it was a 90s film.

There was a scene where they were trying to get up (or maybe down) a cliff and they covered a rock in magic goo, affixed a rope onto it, and then threw it up (or maybe down) the cliff. They then shimmied on the rope to continue on their way. Thats all I got. Please help!

1lbtlu4	Black and white film where it ends with a POV of a gun facing the audience and a flash of red crosses the screen when it goes off	I swear I'm not misremembering this, but no amount of searching key words can find this movie. I was very very little when my grandpa gave me some movie trivia. We were watching Turner Classic Movies and he told me to pay attention to the ending scene of a movie he had on. The characters (I think) ended some kind of argument where one left the other in an office or study room or something, and then the point of view switches to the character left in the room, and they slowly turn the gun to themselves and it's very heavily suggested (but obviously not outright stated) they commit suicide by gunshot. The part that was interesting was the ENTIRE movie was in black and white, except the bang made the screen flash in red before the credits rolled. My grandpa, trying to get me interested, asked me how they did that if the movie was in black and white (I was too young to understand how which was obviously animating over the film a la Anchors Aweigh, but I did understand for the most part there was a time that film was only in black and white, so like. 4-6ish?). Obviously I didn't care, so I never bothered to learn the name of the movie, but 20+ years later and now I have a burning desire to figure out what this movie possibly could be called.

1kqlsmz	I've tried everything for the passed ten years, I can't find this movie to the point I'm starting to think it never existed.	It's an animated movie I'm pretty sure. Saw it when I was a kid, so around the 2000s and early 2010s. It's somewhat realistic, yet very colorful. I watched it in french but can't say if it was the original language. It's first set in a modern city. I remember the protagonist being a girl, she got/found a little dog that she takes with her. The dog gets kidnapped (in an appartment high up a luxurious tower by night ? I think ?). From then I don't remember anything clearly. She finds herself on a green ocean (on a boat ?). And then somehow find out the dog is a prince ? He's being held up in a cage, guarded by a man (or cyclop) that can see the eyes closed, and is blind when the eyes opened Near the end, I think there is a greenhouse with malevolent sentient plants. I'd be very happy if anyone here could tell me this wasn't just a dream and that this movie actually exist.

He seems to be a lunatic. Fast forward, she either ghosts him or breaks up with him? Anyways, Liam Fakesworth tries to contact her and shows up at her place? Somehow meets a new boyfriend of hers (who she told that Unliam Hemsworth is now a creepy ex stalker). They have a fight, knife and/or gun involved. And I think there's another iteration of her telling the same story again. I don't remember how it was resolved but I guess Liam Hemsgreatvalue got the good ending. Bonus: Main character may have been a cop / firefighter something? It may have been an indie movie, but seemed very well made iirc.

1lcq22g	Horro movie early 2000's	Hey everybody! Just recalled a lost memory of a young me shitting my pants because of a horror movie. I will describe the only scene I remember and hope someone can help me find the name. So the scene takes place in a white hallway. Kind of like a facility (imagine Outlast's ending). The deranged killer follows someone at a walk-like pace. Possibly one of them had long hair. I think the victim tries to fight back but (this is the most accurate memory) one of them pulls out 2 syringes and injects the oher one in the neck. There is also a possibility of a severed head and blood further into the scene but I am not sure. Does anybody have any idea?	Horro movie early 2000's Hey everybody!

1kk3yk0	Hii! Im looking for this movie I saw a review of years ago that I'd love to watch.	It was a movie where a group of people are all stuck in a room, each in a small circle, if they try to step out of it they'll die. Every few minutes they have to vote on a person to kill, so little by little they all die until it's only the protagonist left. At the end it's revealed that it was caused by aliens I believe? I think the point of the movie was to showcase how society prioritizes certain people (the unlikeable people died first while a child and a pregnant woman made it further) and that's what the aliens were studying? I saw the review years ago in one of those Movie Recap channels, I don't remember which one unfortunately =- If anyone can help me find the name of this movie it'd be much appreciated =O	Hii!

1l7bul5	Help me find: Action movie where wife is exposed as a spy against husband.	Really hoping someone can help me find this movie. Ive never seen it only a clip on YouTube and I cant for the life of me find the clip or what this movie could be through a Google search. The movie is definitely an action movie. Plot of clip: Man tries to kill what appears to be his best friends wife because shes a spy/double agent against her husband. From what I recall in the clip theyre all having dinner at someones home. One of the guys there is suspicious of his best friends wife and her best friend so he kills the wifes best friend. The husband doesnt wanna believe that his wife may not actually be who she says she is and he insists to his friend that he took all the necessary precautions and that theres just no way that his wife isnt who she says she is. The friend I believe then starts insinuating that the house is bugged and I believe uses radio frequency or something like that to prove to his friend while the wife is begging and pleading for him not to test anything because its not true. When its revealed that she has the house bugged, she tries to shoot them and escapes. Does anyone know what movie this is?? Thanks in advance.

1laf82d	Only know one scene	Its a zombie movie I watched in middle school around 2012, I watched it on Netflix and I think its title cover was all black and the letters were spelling out the title and they had the American flag theme in them or it was faint in the background. The movie was gory as hell, shows people getting their guts eaten on the front lawn of houses and I think it takes place mainly at night. One scene I remember vividly was where the main character (a girl) was escaping zombies and when into a house where one of her school mates live and the dad threatens her with an Axe and she gets placed downstairs where she find the mom chained to the bed in a laying position and shes a zombie, later on the son (her school mate) feels bad and releases her but then the mom breaks free somehow and eats the son and the camera shows it. The main character freaks out and escapes. The film takes place in a small town in America and shows how the infection flies through the town and the main characters experience with it. It is definitely a indie film and is definitely no longer on Netflix.

1kt9jlw	Boyfriend shoots girlfriend in the head during sex - paranormal events ensue	I watched this horror movie around 10 years ago, and its been stuck in my head ever since. In one of the first scenes, a guy is having sex with his girlfriend. As part of their sex play, she gives him a gun. He pulls the trigger thinking its empty, but it goes off and he shoots her in the head, killing her. He panics and doesnt know what to do with the body, so he keeps it in the house. Afterward, paranormal things start happening. I specifically remember: * The entire movie mostly takes place inside the guys house. * In one creepy scene, hes exhausted and lies down near the corpse and the corpses hand starts stroking his head, causing him to jolt awake, only to find that the corpse didn't actually move. * In another scene, someone else enters the house to do a wellness check on him since he hasn't left his home in days. The person enters the room where the corpse should be but the body has disappeared. When the person leaves, the corpse suddenly reappears. It was in English and had a very eerie vibe but not over-the-top gore, but psychological and supernatural horror. I think they tried to keep it open ended about whether the guy was going insane and hallucinating or if the paranormal stuff was really happening. Don't remember the ending at all.

1lf8osk	Old comedy gone from streaming channels	SOLVED! I started to watch and old comedy type film looked kinda like an indie, quirky film the other month maybe April and fell asleep and now it's nowhere to be found on the streaming channels and it's driving me crazy it was removed. The cover art was off white and red ( i believe title was red) with i think people on it. I remember a mean lady who everyone hated and her husband who has like blondish hair has an affair with another women who i believe is a waitress. Then i think she dies or maybe a brother did i can't remember. There is also a scene with someone's pick up truck and the guy is either weird or has a mental disability. I can't remember i was so tired. It looked like it took place maybe before the 70's but it's filmed in the 80's or maybe early 90's. Had some famous actors in it. It is not one of the really common films we see on repeats on TV. What is this movie called possibly so I can finish watching it?	Old comedy gone from streaming channels SOLVED! I started to watch and old comedy type film looked kinda like an indie, quirky film the other month maybe April and fell asleep and now it's nowhere to be found on the streaming channels and it's driving me crazy it was removed. The cover art was off white and red ( i believe title was red) with i think people on it. I remember a mean lady who everyone hated and her husband who has like blondish hair has an affair with another women who i believe is a waitress.

1lbtbg1	Comedy/Drama movie about Guy Haunted By Man In Suit.	So this was around 2015, and I was watching this movie in my brother's laptop. I dont what it's called. But the movie is not exactly a horror, let alone Paranormal. There are intense supernatural or chilling moments. The movie is actually a Comedy/Slice of Life/Drama type of movie. It's about this guy, I think he works at corporate or something. And he is haunted by the guy who's wearing a suit. Again, there are no supernatural elements of scary moments, just a normal guy in a suit. The guys wants nothing to do with the ghost, he finds the situation annoying and tries to ignore it. The ghost I guess, has unfinished business. There is this one scene in the movie where the guy tries to run away from the ghost in broad daylight. And you get this really funny scene where this guy is being chased by a man in a suit. He eventually stops and both kinda seem tired. I forgot the name of the movie, because the didn't even check the name, I just clicked on the movie file an watched it. I'd appreciate the assist, thanks=O<þ=O<þ=O<þ=O<þ	Comedy/Drama movie about Guy Haunted By Man In Suit. So this was around 2015, and I was watching this movie in my brother's laptop.

1kdvw4e	Can you Help me Name this fantasy movie ?	The movie was an independent film or at least it seemed like one. It may not have been American but it sounded close enough like maybe it was American or Canadian. I think k it came out in 2017 or around there. The main charachter was a young woman who somehow had magic. And the series was a dark fantasy series. A little medieval. And she needed to cross the moors for some reason. And there was a dark sorcerer somewhere. And then she somehow met a master who was always wearing a hooded cloak and he taught her some magic or something. The girl was courageous and there wasn't any stupid ""woke girl logic"" to make her strong. She was just a well written character whose strength came from a place of peace and determination and not plot armor. In the end I think her and friends or maybe a side kick or something won some battle with the big bad sorcerer. The whole movie had a good plot through and through. And it looked a little indie but if you ignored the faded colors a bit it seemed professional. The master who taught her or protected her or whatever is actually famous. I watched the movie and recognized him instantly. I first thought he was Brendan Fraser then I thought he was Nathan Fillamon. Not sure but he looks like them and he's famous.

1l5d6b4	Movie where girl makes &amp; saves a ton of money as a janitor?	Its a more recent movie that I really wanted to see but didnt get around to it but I saw the preview. It should be a movie from within the last few years. The main girl, I want to say shes around 15-20 years old, stars working as some kind of janitor for an apt building I think, and she talks to an old man briefly (in the preview) &amp; I dont remember if hes encouraging or discouraging, but either way, it seems like with how hard she works &amp; how she saves everything she makes that she ends up being successful. Also, I think her mom might have died recently and thats why she had to start working. Any ideas? Please help!!	Movie where girl makes &amp; saves a ton of money as a janitor?

One night she is distressed and goes out alone and finds her professor in a bar, they end up sleeping together, and he wants her to call him nigger. The next class they are discussing a novel with an interracial relationship, and they end up both arguing about their encounter while masking it as being about the book.

1l8fzkq	Horror movie where a woman returns to her childhood house with her sister and the town has a dark past	Ok, so my memory on this movie is hazy and I suspect it was released during the mid 2010s. But anyways the movie start with a woman talking to her psychiatrist and she then moves in with her sister, parents are out of the picture. The town people are wary of her moving back, and a man even visits her house and attacks her. I remember the staircase being in front of the front door and I think she knocked the dude down the stairs (or not idk). I think children went missing and they pinned the blame or atleast some of the responsibility on her. Anyways the big bad in the movie is a supernatural, ghostly old woman and I remember the main girl entering some underground bunker and finding a book/pictures of kids holding hands with her and dolls made of sticks. I dont really remember how it ends, but any help is appreciated. I tried ChatGPT but it was a dead end. This has been a serious itch in my brain, thanks.

1l7o2zm	Need help with vigilante movie	A long time ago, around 2007-2010 I found a dvd at home. I was a kid and I watched this movie. Recently I decided I want to find it online but I dont have the name and only small portion of the plot. I think I can recognize it if I had a picture of the main character (the husband). Its a similar plot to Law Abiding Citizen. It was a lesser known movie. I believe it was something like, the husband works some desk job, him and his wife live in the suburbs. Heres when it gets foggy for me but there are few ways it went. He was staying late at work and was on the phone with his wife, he later comes home at night, and finds his wife dead. Another possible option: he was on the phone and she was getting kidnapped. Hes just a regular joe but goes to find the guy responsible for her murder/kidnapping and tortures him I believe in his house basement. I recall he tied the guy to a wooden chair and hammered nails into the guys hands fixing them to the chair armrest. Possibly using a corded drill and drilled into his hands. Thats all I remember lol.

1lb5scc	Trying to Identify a Horror/Thriller from Late 1990s or Early 2000s (Opening scene had a torture chair, eye gouging, spiral stairs) 2/3	Ive been trying to find this movie for years. I saw it when I was a kid, but I only caught the opening scene. It was really dark and I think it took place in a big empty basement. Not quite sure if it was a basement, it was just dark and vast? There was a man in some kind of torture chair, and another man did something really gory to him, maybe gouged his eye or something like that. But the one detail that really stuck with me was a spiral staircase shown right after that. I couldn't watch the whole thing, either I got scared or something interrupted it. I think the movie is from the late 90s or early 2000s. If any of this sounds familiar to anyone, I would love to know what it was. It has been on my mind ever since so please let me know if you have any suggestions or guesses.

1lj6f20	A movie where a little girl is home alone with her dad, dead on the couch, and trying to survive.	Hi Reddit ! I tried my best to remember the name of a movie I watched a while ago... And I need your help. lol. I watched it at least 10 years ago. It's a very dark story. It's basically the story of a little girl (who's around 7, 8yo? can't remember) and her dad, a hard rock musician in the United States. Her dad, who's having drug issues, is going through some trouble and decides to escape with her and find shelter in a house in the countryside. So the 2 characters are going in the house, and shortly after that, the dad dies on the sofa (probably an overdose). The rest of the movie is about his daughter trying to survive alone in the house, until she finds someone. If I remember correctly, the people she find aren't really friendly (a mother and her son with heavy mental health issues). Any help would be appreciated ! :)	A movie where a little girl is home alone with her dad, dead on the couch, and trying to survive. Hi Reddit !

1lcqnyh	Sci-fi film where humans are born in some flying structure	Hi, I remember a film I watched a looong time ago when I was a teen. I dont remember much so I dont think I'm gonna be of much help but I could definitely recognize a screenshot of some scene. I dont remember the main plot or characters. I pretty much only remember it was based on some dystopian future Earth, at some point it is revealed that humans are either born or cloned or something along the lines in some sort of laboratory which is a really weird oval shaped structure which floats above the city. The oval building has a very strange interior with alien looking shapes and doesnt look like a laboratory at all, there is an old man working in this structure. It had action and the protagonist might have been a woman, but I dont remember that well. The art and architecture of the film had some frutiger-aero style and the film must be from between 1990s and early 2000s, it could be older that that tho.

There was like meatballs aliens, pencil aliens, and aliens that looked like devices(they were literally phones and computers) and they all had to build robots to fight each other in the arena.

1ld6byo	Lookin for an older movie	My stepdad, who was a boomer if that helps with the timeline, had shown me a movie that was an alien body snatchers type deal, but it wasnt Invasion of the Body Snatchers nor Invasion from Mars. It starts with a boy whose dad gets taken by aliens that arrive in an intensely bright light, and is taken to some crater that is later revealed to have an alien base underneath it, which can be accessed by some kind of sinking spots like quicksand in it? It always made me think of Pokemon Mystery Dungeons, the desert stage where you fall through the quicksand into a dungeon below. His dad comes back, notably fussing with a weird wound on the nape of his neck and having less ability to emote or show emotion. Later on his mom also gets nabbed, and it goes through the whole sequence of him trying to save them, at the end its shown to be a dream, but then the lights that occur when stealing the parents away happens again at the end. I loved this movie so much but i just cannot find it. Appreciate yall!

1kj3e05	I saw a single clip of a movie years ago and have no idea what it is.	So I was very young and I was up late one night when I was certainly not supposed to be. I was channel surfing when I landed on what I can only assume was a movie. I cant even remember if the movie was in English (I had a really nice cable package as a kid that included a lot of international channels haha). Anyways, this is the only clip I can remember and it is SO weird that it came into my brain recently so I wanted some help finding it: I have no context for the scene but I think a white(?) couple was naked in what looked like a cave(?). I dont remember much about the man, but the woman had a full bush (iconic) and very long black hair that went down to her waist and covered her breasts. They were lying together when another fully clothed white(?) man (I think he was in some kind of medieval outfit?) came into the scene and everyone started arguing. They all began to stand and yell, when the clothed man drew a sword. The naked man was backed into a corner and the naked woman shielded the naked man from the clothed man and his sword. They all continued to argue when I eventually changed the channel. Now that I think about it, Im honestly wondering if I accidentally watched some kind of dirty movie. But yea, if anyone has any idea what this scene belongs to Id love to know! Edit 1: this happened around 2005-ish on cable tv. I was around 9 or 10 Edit 2: the movie is confirmed to be [Monty Python's Life of Brian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python%27s_Life_of_Brian)	I saw a single clip of a movie years ago and have no idea what it is.

At one point there is an argument and a fight between them, then A tries to hit B with a huge object on a chain (a hook or a smth other), and there is two plot continuations: 1. The canonical continuation: B dodges, defeats A, and then the movie goes on. There is a woman with him, and at the end of the movie they both end up in a bright room where they have to cut themselves with a scalpel and use a scanner to look for codes inside them both, and then the scene changes to the beach where they are resting. 2. Not the canonical version: B faints from the hit and that's the end. I'm not crazy, that's a real movie I saw couple years ago.	2000-2010s movie, remember only few parts from plot, pls help!!!!!!

1lcw9n6	A childhood Film	Hello, this is vagur attemot to find a long lost childhood film. Its something like Tales of Treasure Island or escpape from.mystery island. anyway moving foward. It starts off with a young teen aged boy, he has a book. He somehow gets pulled into the book and wakes up on an island. Its very pirate themed. With alot of cheesy humour. On the pirates was a tall male (african i think) with a short blade that was think to thick (,interms of blade width) shaped with a curved angle. Main pirate is blackbeard look a like i think. Its really hard to remember for me, but i think the young boy had to find some treasjre which had the key or something to get back to real world. There was a weird cave/tomb tbey went into (big pirates head style tomb) which turned everyone to stone (i could potentially be muddling this part up with another film) I am sure the film ended with the boys nan or soemthing whonwas just reading the story and all was a dream, or was it ? Please i am hoping you beautiful folks have the answer for me!	A childhood Film Hello, this is vagur attemot to find a long lost childhood film.

1l85fv4	Aliens pretending to be human - 90s/early 00s - comedy (?)	Saw this on TV in the early 00s, guessing it first came out a few years before that. In the movie, there are a number of aliens disguised as men in black suits (I believe also wearing hats) pretending to be humans. They look convincing enough, but their knowledge of human customs falls short and it is played up for comedic effect. One line I remember is one of the aliens asking a man, who was smoking a cigarette, if he was aware there was a burning stick hanging from his face - or something to that effect. There's also a scene in an elevator (eerily specific, I know). It probably also had liberal use of fisheye lens effects. ~~Not entirely sure this is from the same movie, but I also remember a scene where one of the aliens, upon first arriving on Earth, steps out onto the road to try and shake hands with a car coming down the road, and they get hit. They later mention there were so many cars all over, the aliens thought cars were the dominant species on the planet.~~ This scene is in fact from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and not the movie I am looking for. EDIT: Found! It was a series called The Strangerers. For anyone stumbling upon this thread in the future, it looks like the entire series is available on YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/@robgrantsthestrangerers1434](https://www.youtube.com/@robgrantsthestrangerers1434)	Aliens pretending to be human - 90s/early 00s - comedy (?)

I have never been able to find this movie, it doesnt seem to star anyone real famous, it wasnt Death Wish, or any Steven Segal flick, which others thought it was when I mentioned it to them.

1lc5udg	Whats the Name of this Horror Movie!!! A Promiscuous Demon Woman from the 1980-90.	A horror movie from the 80s or 90s, where the main character, who is a Caucasian lady, becomes a demon. When she transforms, she becomes promiscuous and her hair turns red, in a short wild hair style. Also her face turns white, and she kills men after she has sex with them. I believe this was spoofed in the movie Dont Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood, the scene where Loc Dogg and the lady have sex in the van. This is where the gift that I linked came from, this is similar to what she looked like. Please help. Ive been looking for this movie for years! I rented it from Hollywood years ago.

1l623ev	Trying to find a movie like Saw	This has been bothering me since I was a kid. I remember watching a horror movie when I was a kid, and I believe it was released sometime between the 1980s and 2010. There were scenes where the characters had to cross a thin wooden pathif they fell, they would land on a bunch of saw blades. There were also traps, like sharp metal spikes coming out of the walls. I recall two villains: one was a bald man with an axe, and the other (as far as I remember) was a woman with a masculine build who used a bow and arrows to kill people. This movie is like Saw where the characters has to find their way out by escaping bunch and bunch of trap. Finding this movie would really mean a lot to me, as I want to watch it again. I remember being completely hooked the first time I saw it.	Trying to find a movie like Saw This has been bothering me since I was a kid.

1l8w9n4	Help finding a movie please.	Hello, I was recently flipping through some DVDs that were for sale at my local library, there was one I was going to buy but I didn't have cash on me. I went back a few days later, but someone else had purchased it. I believe it was post 2015, it seemed like an indie movie, I remember the cover had a lot of blue tones. The premise from what I remember was a man was hitchhiking to meet up with a woman who he was pen-pals with. The woman had recently been released from jail/prison. The man who picks up the hitchhiker decides to steal his identity so he can meet the woman instead. It is possible I flipped the characters and the man picked up a hitchhiker who then steals his identity. I tried asking Google about this and it couldn't find what I was looking for since I didn't have much specific information. I didn't recognize any of the actors names, it felt like an indie/B movie.

I think it had to do with radiation outside, so people were living together in some kind of bunker or something. They send out someone and they take off their helmet to breathe in the air, but they die. Someone figures out that there actually is no radiation outside but rather it's the suits or something else that is sabotaged/rigged to kill the person to make the others believe the air is still deadly. In the end I think the protagonist manages to escape and they breathe in the air and they're completely fine. Thank you!	Fake Radiation Scare??

If the lantern runs out of fuel the monsters will start chasing them because that's the obly thing that keeps them away. They barely manage to get out of there. Thank you very much in advance.

1kchl23	90s movie with mom on a truck with small carousel	I remember renting a movie in the 90s, I think a little boy may have been witness to a murder, the hitman abducts the kid, mom goes after them. The guy steals a truck with a little carousel in the back, the kind on a sidewalk outside a store. Mom gets in bed of truck, but she keeps getting slammed into the truck window, stuck between the window and the carousel. It's probably the saddest yet most honest rescue attempt ever.... What was this movie???! Pretty sure this would've been after 1994, if that helps.	90s movie with mom on a truck with small carousel I remember renting a movie in the 90s, I think a little boy may have been witness to a murder, the hitman abducts the kid, mom goes after them.

1lk0kg4	Robert De Niro type character in a movie with fat woman [Repost]	I'm looking for again. I remember only one scene. The characted played by Robert De Niro (or Dustin Hoffman or somebody similar) is virgin man. The character is 35-40 years old, I think. He saw fat woman (perhaps prostitute), which was friend of other person, but I don't remember exactly. Then, they have sex (although it wasnt showed probably) and he is glad, because it was his first time. It was typical road movie and Im sure that it was during long travel and rather action movie than comedy. I think that it was typical road movie with a motel scene or something similar. Perhaps it was action movie (or comedy) from 90s or 2000s. Definitely USA. Perhaps its Mandela Effect and it isnt any of these actors, but Im sure mentioned scene. I am sure that it could be quite popular movie. It isn't ""Rain Man"" definitely.	Robert De Niro type character in a movie with fat woman [Repost] I'm looking for again. I remember only one scene.

1kuryu3	Movie transmitted on a children channel in the 2000's	I recently recalled some movies I saw on TV when I was a kid back in the 2000's but there is one particular movie I barely remember and I would like to find more details about it. I remember only seeing it once so I don't have many details. This is what little I can remember: -The movie was Live Action -It was transmitted on a kid channel, most probably Disney Channel, so it must be PG-13 rated or less. -The lead character was a girl (I think she was blond), who lives with unloving parents. -There was a disaster (I think it was an earthquake) that forced her to move away. On this note, I remember the scene about the disaster being about the girl hiding under a bed and hearing people screaming and there were soem stuff that got set on fire. -She moved with some relatives that lived in a gigantic Victorian house and there she meets a kid that turns out to be her cousin. I think the cousin was disabled or something like that as I think that he was sitting down in all of his scenes. -I seem to recall the cousin starting to have a crush on her but the girl reminds him they are relatives. These are some looses details and I hhave no idea of the overall plot. Maybe I am just mixing various movies into one in my memories. But if anyone can identify a movie similar to this, please let me know.

1liv8qa	Got 2 movies for ya	These 2 movie scenes are driving me crazy and ive searched high and low and cant find anything... i made this account just get some help on it. First movie has the scene from ghostbusters 84 in it. The scene where they are first at the firehouse looking to buy it. Its the exterior shot of the firehouse where the realtor lady is talking. I saw this scene in some movie lately and as a ghostbusters fan i instantly recognized it. I guess due to copyright or whatever, the scene has been mirrored. Obv it would have been a movie made after 84 and set in nyc. I use hulu, max, pluto and tubi and ive browsed every movie i could think it could be and cant find anything. Could have been a tv show then. Anyone? Second movie was something made in 90's. I swear the scene had bruce willis in it and at some point the kid in the movie shot him with a bb gun. I remember the scene at the very end and bruce willis? Has the bb gun and aims at the kid and you here him shoot the gun and the screen goes blank and you hear the kid go ouch! I remember the scene seemed odd even as a kid watching it bc when he shot it it made the sound of a shell casing hit the ground. The only movie i found with imdb that had a kid and bruce willis (not sixth sense) was the movie ""North"" i dont have access to that movie but im thinking thats not it. It could have been someone other than willis but i just remember his face in the scene. Thanks!

1lhgddb	2000s renaissance film.	I think it's a Johnny Depp movie. But my memory is hazy. It's setting is 1700s to 1800s or something around renaissance, not medieval. It's a dark movie about reality and people living in poverty in gothic Europe. Not sure if it's fantasy, action or just plain drama. The only scene I can remember is one of the protagonist fell in love with a waitress/hostess but the waitress said he fell in love with a corpse. I think she's suffering from severe tuberculosis and died after a few scenes. Not really sure about any of the stuff I said but would greatly appreciate any suggestions that fits these descriptions. Thanks in advance! It's not ""Perfume: The Story of a Murderer"".	2000s renaissance film. I think it's a Johnny Depp movie. But my memory is hazy.

1ljpbvy	Trade wishes for memories	I've been looking for this movie since I watched it as a child in the late 2000s/early 2010s. All I can remember plot wise is that it was about a boy and a witch(??) in a fantasy world. There was some sort of machine that would create a glowing orb every time he made a wish and for every wish he lost a part of his memories. There might have been other fantasy creatures. I remember there definitely being a scene with a waterfall (maybe him jumping?) and somewhere in the movie he must have traded enough wishes to completely lose his memories, including any of his father(who was looking for him the whole time) if I remember correctly. I appreciate any potential leads because i've been DYING to watch it again to see what was going on :( Edit: Solved!

1ljmfwu	80s/early 90s? Horror movie help please!	I watched this horror film on a video rental in the late 80s/early 90s. It was a really good film and for 30 odd years I've been wondering what it was called! This is what I can remember: "" A group of young people were staying in an old house. I think it was a large, whitish house. One by one, they got killed. "" One of the killers was a slim, old man with grey hair wearing denim dungarees, weilding an axe or sythe. I can picture him so easily in my minds eye now. "" I think there was a camper trailer and one of the women (who got killed) ran into the camper trailer. She had long dark hair. In the camper trailer, she turned the taps and she screamed as blood came out the taps. "" I vaguely recall someone else (I think a young man) was killed by falling through the old rickety wooden floors of the house. He fell through multiple floors then landed and drowned in a thick, white slimy substance in the cellar. I remember my friend saying she think's the film may have been called ""Ghost House"", but I've googled ""Ghost House"" and nothing matches. It was a great film and we all enjoyed it.

1l23glb	Recent Werewolf Movie	Hey all, I watched a good werewolf film recently but can't find the name. Set in rural Europe possibly early 20th century. Lead actor was 30-ish attractive Irish looking with black hair. His character was a studious type, visiting a hamlet. I think the young son of the farmer he was staying with was the werewolf. He tracks animal mutilations amidst the crops. The ending takes place in the village church, at night, where townfolks have taken sanctuary and there's a weird supernatural 'osmosis' whereby the mother dies but the son is cured of his lycanthropy. Cheers.	Recent Werewolf Movie Hey all, I watched a good werewolf film recently but can't find the name. Set in rural Europe possibly early 20th century.

1ldztf0	Childhood Nightmares	I was very young when I saw this, but it traumatized me for life - now, as an adult, I've scoured the Internet to no avail. Maybe you can help: The movie was set in a fantasy world. I believe the main character was a young girl. In a culminating scene, the evil queen captures her, and this queen has a penchant for boiling her captives alive. As the girl is being lowered into boiling water, in what's essentially a giant teabag, two fairy girls that the main character had encountered earlier in the story swap places with her. An ancillary character explains that fairies actually LOVE boiling water, and we cut to the fairies splashing around happily inside the teabag thing. Does anyone have any ideas?

So, totally stumped and my wife is thinking of a movie when we put on Grey Man (Gosling/Evans) and something triggered a memory of a movie with this vague description. Been racking my brain with her limited set of clues lol 1) there is a couple (but maybe a fellow friend con man) 2) there is some sort of box the couple is trying to find. (Wife thinks music box) 3) there is an old man that they try to trick him is some way that the female of the couple is the old man's dead wife by wearing a dress (white, again maybe?) 4) and things go wrong. I tried asking about actors she remembered or the period of time the movie was set in and no more recollections If anyone has the vaguest idea, it would be awesome lol	Couple try to trick an old man by having the woman pose as his dead wife (maybe?)

1lhi7w1	Help me to find this scene - AI is useless! Two men in an office having a casual conversation. They're interrupted all the time by odd phone calls where the host goes silent and only says YES or NO.	Today I remembered one of those scenes that always make me laugh out loud, while most people feel meh about it. I need to watch it today please =O<û The movie is likely to be a satirical comedy like ""Big short"" but I'm not sure... it's the same kind of tone and humor. In the scene, there are two men in an office setting (or home office). Both are sitting in chairs, in one man's office or wfh room. I believe the host has a moustache and it's a known face (ie male actor with dozens of movies and TV appearances) The two men are having a casual conversation and the guest is asking a favor or sorting something with the host. The tone is casual. Then the phone rings. The host goes silent for a couple mins and then says YES and hangs up. He doesn't say ""Hi"" or talk with the person on the phone at all. The only word he says is YES or NO. They continue the casual conversation. Same story, phone rings, host says NO, hangs up. And this keeps on happening. The scene illustrates the absurdity of some leadership roles, and the absurdity of having a casual conversation while being interrupted for critical items all the time. The movie is very likely from year 2000 onward. Thanks in advance! =O<û	Help me to find this scene - AI is useless! Two men in an office having a casual conversation.

1ke8svz	Murder Thriller based on familicide	So from what I remember, it was a familicide with a hand gun. It almost had a Lifetime-feel to it, but murder. I believe it was a male who annihilated his family. Or a woman. At least four victims and at least one was a child. Im for certain one was a young boy. In one particular scene, I remember him or her dragging/carrying them to the living room and placing them side-by-side and covering them with (white?) sheets. I believe this was the very ending, and there was much more to the movie than just straight murder. It was a fairly large house, Victorian maybe? Movie from the late 80s or 90s or even super early 2000s. It could have been based on a true story but everything Ive researched has come up null. It gives me big Stephen King vibes. This movie has been stuck in my head for years. And when I say that, I was around 10 years old, flipping through channels when I stumbled upon it. I think it may have traumatized me but I want to see if it actually exists or if it was just a nightmare. Help me solve this mystery! Many thanks.

1lcgtz2	Religious Horror	Hello, I am searching for this movie that I saw with my friends. I don't remember what platform it was on but I remember a lot of the movie. I think the movie was just one word, could be two though. I'm like so sure the main actress was Zoe Perry but when searching her name nothing of that movie shows up. Anyways, she goes to her parents place where her dad is on his bed. He's old, doesn't really move and is supposedly possessed. There's a being in the movie that slowly drives everyone to kill themselves. Another scene is where the main actress is in the shower and gets jumpscared by her dad being there. The mom hangs herself, the caregiver kills themselves, and the brother kills himself in the end after the being gives him a vision that his family is dead. He almost died beforehand in some like barn. The place is also like in the middle of nowhere. This doesn't sound like much actually but any help is appreciated. Thanks!!

1l6ejje	Late 80s/Early 90s late night HBO movie. One scene is burned into my brain	Mildly NSFW I recall this movie from seeing it on late night cable. More likely HBO than skinemax. It wasn't really soft core porn. I would have seen it probably between 91-93. It was almost definitely straight to video/cable and low budget. Anyway, there is one scene I remember vividly, that kind of haunted me. The movie was darkly futuristic and the scene I remember involved the main character and his friend, who was possibly developmentally disabled, or at least ""a little slow""/""not all there"", looking through a landfill to find something the MC lost. Pretty sure both characters were white, and I feel like the friend was noticably dirty and maybe wearing overalls. He was definitely skinny. At one point his friend finds a nude, dead woman. He looks over the body curiously, while the camera occasionally cuts back to the MC still searching, then the friend quickly licks her breasts before covering her body with some large trash, seemingly hiding her to ""save for later"". I'm sorry I don't have anything more to go on, but the memory of this has been haunting me for over 30 years and I'm hoping someone can help me here.	Late 80s/Early 90s late night HBO movie.

1kgd3me	Vampire movie	Not that old, probably early 2000. A family lives a seemingly normal life (maybe two young adults as siblings, woman and man, and I don't think they show the parents), they are home alone and so the woman invites a friend over, the friend likes the brother, can't remember much about that. I think at some point the woman offers the friend to the brother for eating? I don't remember if the friend dies or not, she might have ran away. And at the end, they embrace the fact that they are vampires and decided to run away? And before that, they go to the basement where they have a younger sibling, a boy who is much more feral and blood thirsty. It's been probably more than a decade since I watched it, so sorry for such a bad description, lol.	Vampire movie Not that old, probably early 2000.

1kcik2o	80's/90s movie where remaining time of life is used as currency. Not the Justin Timberlake movie.	I can see this clearly in my head on my grandmother's old TV. It was on one day and the characters basically has credit card wipers implanted into them and it allowed them to pay for stuff with miinutes. There was a scene where a guy gambled his last minutes away, possibly in a casino. It was older and definitely not super high quality. Definitely before 1995. If anyone can find this one I will be in debt and amazed.	80's/90s movie where remaining time of life is used as currency. Not the Justin Timberlake movie.

It killed a man and put on the skin of the man, seeming just like the man but very weird. Then it walked into the man's house and asked for a tea (coffee?), with sugar. His wife seemed confused but did not suspected much, and added like a spoon, but it demanded more sugar. At last the wife added a whole jar of sugar into the drink.

1l4812z	Kids/Family Fantasy Film with Little Guy that gets Big	My dad rented the movie one time when I was 7 and I watched it 20 times over the 1 weekend but now i cant think of the name. The movie must have been mid 80s to early 90s based on memory of production. The main character was a little boy in a medieval fantasy world. He was the son of some rich or noble man (maybe king) who gives him a little clay man as a gift/pet. the little guy was a tannish orange color and had a face sort of like the not the momma baby from Dinosaurs. The plot is lost to me now but I remember when the little guy got wet (or maybe its when he drank) he would grow to the size of a kaiju and start destroying little villages and taverns. I think his size depended on how much liquid hed absorbed and he would slowly seep the liquid as he got smaller. I believe at the end of the movie the little guy as a kaiju thinks he killed the boy and then weeps causing him to shrink rapidly and somehow save the boy (I unironically might be imagining that part) I can recall a specific scene where the evil-doers either accidentally pour wine from a barrel onto the little guy or think its a good idea to hide and transport the little guy in a nearly full barrel causing him to erupt out the top of the building. I wish i had more details to give but i can really only remember flashes of imagery without any narrative context. If anyone can help me find this i would be greatly appreciative and if i can provide any clarifications or extra info. please let me know.

1kn93lp	A movie about a man and his many sex partners	Hello, I want to rewatch this one movie which I have watched many years ago, I generally remember the plot and even the ending I belive, however for some reason I cannot find it. The general plot of the movie is pretty straight forward, a man in the 1700 - 1800's (very not sure about the timeline, the movie is set in the past) in either Spain or Italy narrates the movie reading from his ""Sex Journal"" where he has taken notes about every sexual partner (women) hes have had (hundreds, maybe even thousands). The one woman that he has really fallen for has rejected him but in the end of the movie, finally when they are old and wrinkled they get married and have sex on a ship (not sure about the married part) I also remember a scene where the man has sex with a women in the street, hiding behind a pillar while they cover each others mouths and a scene where he writes ""This is mine"" (I think) above a womans vagina with I think fish blood?? and the womans husband finds out and beats her? (or kills her?) I also remember the man's mother playing a big role in his life. For some reason I remember Javier Bardem playing the main role however this is probably not possible as I have searched through all of his films and I think none fit the profile. The more I wrote the more the movie felt like something I've seen in a dream and doesn't actually exist. Note: although it sounds a like a movie about Casanova, I don""t think it is.

1lf254e	Murder mystery movie	Alright i've been looking for this movie for a while now, what i remember from it was that the main character was i believe a detective of some sort investigating missing kids (only boys), he also had vision of these kids i think and in one scene has a vision of one of the missing boy vomiting dirt which gave him a clue they were dead and buried. The culprit was a woman who was kidnapping kids and burying them (alive?) in some forest where her son who i think died in some tragic accident was also buried, so that he wouldn't be alone. It may have been a direct-to-dvd type of movie it didn't seem like it was made for theater but i've seen it in my native language so again not too sure (but it was definitely an american movie). Lastly the title in english may have included ""heaven"" or ""stairway"".

It may have been a direct-to-dvd type of movie it didn't seem like it was made for theater but i've seen it in my native language so again not too sure (but it was definitely an american movie). Lastly the title in english may have included ""heaven"" or ""stairway"".	0	0	0	1	0	0	20	804	825	3	152	155	13.113333333333333	13.020000000000003	13.463113924050635	3	NA	NA	1	NA	NA	NA	1	3
1lhozh5	Old movie where a sleepwalker sees a murder?	I was six years old and watch this on TV without my parents knowing. Had nightmares for weeks! So older than 1976. I have just fractions of memories but it was in a big house and someone sleepwalked and saw a murder or murders. I think there was hidden doors involved. Male protagonist who wasn't sure if he actually had seen something or was just dreaming. Does this ring any bell for someone? I really would like to see it again to find out what was so scary. Bear in mind I was only six so maybe it isn't a horror movie or even a thriller. Just to me! =	Old movie where a sleepwalker sees a murder?

1l8pri7	I can't remember the name of this movie	So, I was talking to my wife about romance movies that she and I liked and this movie flashed in my memories, and neither I nor chat gpt could remember the name based on this things: 1.The movie is about a kid that leaves his town/neighborhood as a teen and comes back as a grown up, he ends up talking to a woman about his past and some memories come through as flashbacks. 2. During these flashbacks, he tells about a friend of his, with some intellectual disabilities (for some reason in my mind the actor is Robin Williams, but I can't be sure). 2.1. They were delivery boys that ran errands with a bicycle and I remember that in one of those deliveries a woman was lying in a bed a showed her p*** as a 'tip' for their delivery. 2.2. For some reason, they got into an argument or fight and stopped talking to each other. But as the movies goes on, in the present time the woman he's talking to incentives their meeting. 3. During the flashbacks, there is a locked up black woman that talks to his reflection through a shattered mirror glass while he's at the street and talks looking to her cell windows. 3.1. She gives him some love advice, and how to invite the girl he likes to the prom, and also how to dance with her. 3.1.1 During the prom the only thing I remember was that he was wearing a really really orange suit, like, really orange. 3.2. For some reason the woman and kid got into a discussion and she lies to him telling she in jail for murder. Only to know at their present time she was locked up for some misdemeanor. 4. At close to the end, the movie goes to present time and he meets his old friend and they both ride a bike, with the girl he was talking to during the whole movie.

1lbdwz0	Disturbing film about friend group	I was watching a Youtube video about disturbing movies that were more on the obscure side, so not the most common ones such as American Psycho or Silence of the lambs but more so Parents (1989) and Possession (1981). I was trying to find the YouTube video however I cannot which is kind of a bummer because I'm not the biggest fan of traditional horror but rather psychological horror as there is an element of realness to them as in it could actually happen to somebody in real life which adds a scarier element to them, however thats just my opinion. Their was another movie referenced about a group of i think highschool/college friends who end up turning on one of there female members in the group thier behaviour eventually becomes borderline abusive towards her as they basically start to tourment her. The main scene I rememeber the video describing was a metaphoric scene where the friend group tie rope around a bird representing the friend there bullying. Everytime the bird goes to fly they take it in turns to pull the bird down tormenting the bird as if so there friend. It would be a big help if anyone could help me find the movie so I can give it a watch. From my memory the film did not look new and was most likely made around the time that the others were mentioned as well. Thank you for making it this far and listening hope i somebody known the film I'm describing or youtube video it self if I'm lucky.

I unfortunately can't remember what their suits looked like.	1	0	1	0	1	0	44	880	925	7	166	173	10.740000000000002	11.728473053892213	10.854860426929395	4	2	3	1	1	0	2	1	3
1kgh476	1980s Animated Film - Sort Of Asian Setting But Not Really?	I'm pretty sure the film was around the 1980s. The setting seemed asian, though it might be made by US. Basic plot of the story was about a girl and her cat. A prince (?) passed by their village, but for some amusing series of coincidences, he only saw either the cat or the girl - but never both at the same time. And it happened so fluidly, that he thought the poor girl was under a curse (where she turns into a cat every now and then), so he made it his quest to release the girl from her ""curse"" (or at least, that's how I understood it back then; hey, I was barely 10 years old then!). Long story short: there was an incident where the cat was swept away in the river (or flood), so the prince valiantly rescued the cat (thinking it was the girl), and sort of confessed his love for the girl (who at this point of the story, was already intentionally tricking the prince with the cat-body swapping antics). The girl, who was hiding within earshot, couldn't help herself and burst out laughing loudly and uncontrollably - to the surprise of the prince, who just realized that he was being pranked all this time. I don't recall what else happened, but I do wanna watch this movie again with my daughter.	1980s Animated Film - Sort Of Asian Setting But Not Really? I'm pretty sure the film was around the 1980s.

1kddk8r	Movie with an assassin with a blonde pixie cut and a pink bikini?	A movie scene was playing the other day and I wanted to know what it was called, if anyone knows. There was a blonde assassin (very stereotypical femme fatale I think) with a pixie cut and smeared black makeup. She was essentially wearing a pink bikini top and a very short pink skirt or shorts (Im not sure I didnt see very well). She was shooting at police with two guns and then got into a car with a guy who kinda looked like Woody Harrelson (he might not look like him at all though, I suck at faces). They then got into a car chase with the police. I thinks she licked the guys face at some point (she seems like a typical unhinged assassin thats common in action movies). I think there was also a couple whose son is missing? They were at a pool and were arguing cause the dad got a gift and the mom said that was his hobby last year and that now he plays football. Im pretty sure the movie was set in the USA, and I think that the actors were American (but Im terrible at accents and it was not very loud so I cant be sure). Does anyone recognize this? I was just curious what movie it is, and if really appreciate it if anyone knows. Edit: it was Transporter 2! Thank you everyone!	Movie with an assassin with a blonde pixie cut and a pink bikini?

1lb1zst	Old Black &amp; White Movie - Ends with the Antagonist Stepping out of an Airship and falling to his doom.	This is an old movie I saw on late night TV about 30 years ago, so my recollections arent the best, but here goes nothing. I believe it was British. It involved numerous people crossing paths with and plotting against the antagonist who was some kind of conman I think? One character was an older lady who I believe was a novelist, at one point she tries to acquire a ""mickey finn"" which is some kind of knock out drug. She's hilariously misinformed and out of her depth trying to buy this from patrons in a seedy pub at the wrong end of town. The one part that is most clear in my memory is the final scene where everyone had ended up on an airship in flight, the antagonist is unaware having been unconscious. He wakes up, berates his would be captors and says he is off to report them to the police before stepping out the door of the airship and falling to his presumed demise.

1lhjrz8	Early 2000s-late 90s assassins action movie	The movie is from that era, starring iirc an Asian actress. The premise of it was a bunch of assassins (?) had bombs implanted in them and forced to kill each other I think, with the bombs preventing them from exiting the city. Notable scenes in the movie were a guy chopping off another's fingers using a cigar cutter. And a scene with the lead actress taking off the bomb from her abdomen. There's probably some wrong minor details here but this is all i can remember. I watched this like 17 years ago.

Everybody was wearing black, except the young girl who is in her early to mid 20s, she is wearing a white gown. They like this platform on fire and one of two things happen. 1) she jumps off and her mother takes the place and gets burnt on the platform as the young girl runs away through a field. 2) her mother has a change of heart and pushes her off the platform and sacrifices herself to be burned, and the girl runs through a field to get away. As shes running through the field, the movie ends and thats it. Thats all I can remember.

1kct0om	Can't remember the name of a particular movie I saw a year or 2 ago, and it's driving me crazy!!	I'm looking for the name of a particular movie, which I have definitely watched, but now I can't find it anywhere. I've done a lot of google searching and asking chatGPT, (both of which act like the movie doesn't exist), and haven't been able to come up with anything. It seems really weird because it wasn't like some totally obscure, micro-budget, bad indie movie, that no-one has heard of. It was a low/mid-budget, full length, normal, high quality, feature film, which i think was originally released on, or produced by either netflix or amazon prime. The movie is about a depressed, neurodivergent, socially withdrawn/socially awkward trash collector. Usually, every morning, a friendly child waves at him from their front yard, during his garbage collection route. But one day, the child isn't there. The man begins to realize something might have happened to the child, and (rather ineptly) begins trying to investigate what might have happened to the child. The trashman notices odd changes in the familys trash and neighborhood behavior. Using his own unique way of thinking and observing details others often overlook, he starts piecing together what may have happened to the boy.

1kkf2z2	Trying to find a horror film I watched 5+ years ago	I don't remember the exact time I watched this but it was definitely more than 5 years ago. I can only remember one scene and it is very disturbing. Basically a young white woman is tied down either onto a chair or bed by an older woman (I can't remember if they kidnapped the young woman or if the woman was working for them) and the older woman has a son who was sitting on a chair and he has some neurological issues and I think was overweight. The older woman puts a condom on her son and makes him ejaculate using her hands, she then takes his sperm and puts it into a syringe that she then injects into the captured woman's uterus. I cannot for the life of me remember anything else about this film and I can't find any leads on reddit or using ai film finders. Can anyone help me figure this film out, I'm 90 percent sure this was an American English film but I could be wrong. Thanks.

1l69mek	Older likely Japanese film, where a man confronts an immortal warrior and must dual to the death.	The description is not great. I cannot remember the setup well, its been about 20 years since i saw the movie. The main character enters some sort of building, i think it was to take shelter for the night. Meet an immortal warrior who has never been defeated, he has been cursed where the only way he can leave is to die, and have who killed him take his place there, the MC cannot leave either. The place they are trapped is filled with many different weapons. One part that's always stuck with me was, one of the weapons was an old single action revolver, where the MC keeps forgetting to pull the hammer back, and the warrior stops to remind him of that fact. It may not actually be Japanese, but it was south east Asian. I used to watch a lot of foreign films when i was a teen on free to air TV in Australia, one of the main stations SBS used to air an episode of Anime in the evening followed by a foreign film, and this was one of them. I hope my description tips someone who knows it off.	Older likely Japanese film, where a man confronts an immortal warrior and must dual to the death. The description is not great.

1lerlxh	Hey guys got a scene stuck in my head and cant bring to mind what its from	So basically I believe it is the cold open to a TV show ( may be wrong) probably something crime solving related. I remember its a bunch of nuns running through the streets fighting with little context to start, then it seems theyre fighting over something and it gives the impression that theyre corrupted and being greedy over whatever it is they keep stealing from one another. All while running through the streets with whoevers in possession of the thing running away from the rest of them. Then I believe at the end it turns out its the opposite of what were led to believe and whatever the thing is (possibly a bomb) is guaranteed to kill one of them and they are fighting each other so that the rest survive and only the nun holding the item is sacrificed? Thats all I remember and its just the one short scene but I believe its all instigated by an unknown killer/ psychopath.

1ld1nzi	Horror movie where group of people are abducted from a vacation home and forced into strange experiments	Hello all! I watched this movie I believe on Comcast On-Demand probably in the early 2010s but can't be sure. Some specific things I remember about the movie are: I believe the vacation home was very strange like made out of concrete kind of brutalist? Pretty sure the place they get abducted to is some facility under the vacation home. (Its not Cabin In The Woods) Think the vacation home turned out to be a house one of the characters was watching for someone he worked for. Two of the people abducted are strapped to medical tables, one is given an injection of some kinda of bioweapon and the other is the control but they don't know which is which. They manage to escape but of course the one who got the bioweapon dies while on the run. One person gets tied to a pole in a basement (parking garage maybe?) and is shot while another has to perform emergency first aid on them. Starts with the movie's antagonist shooting them in the arm or leg, then the stomach, so on. Pretty sure it was a b rater horror film. I'll try to think of more details but if someone has any leads or ideas I'd really appreciate it! Thanks!

1ljpv0x	Cabin Horror/Suspense	Hi all, this movie came up as a suggested next watch on a streaming service a while back and I haven't been able to find it again. The story is that a group of friends was in a car crash which killed one of them, as a way to grieve they go to a cabin to get their minds off it. There is a scene at the wake where a family member (uncle I believe) yells at the young protagonist (female) saying it was her fault, I think, and wishing it had been her, then a friend steps in to diffuse it. At the cabin someone starts hunting the group of friends and it ends with a revelation (it was the uncle). It didn't seem at all like a big budget movie and no actors that I could recognize/name.

His head deformes and he gets Black eye(s). I saw it early 90's. It had an 80's vibe to it.	Help finding a movie. This is by far a long shot. I saw the movie as a kid.

The girl goes to school and apparently there are other parents who killed their daughters on their birthday. I don't remember if it was 15 or 16. It turns out that they couldn't have children and they made a pact with the devil, who instead took over them at a certain age. The girl asks for help from a classmate of hers to baptize her and tries to drown her, saying that her soul can only be saved if she dies before the demon possesses her. In the end the girl chooses the side of evil and joins others like her, her teacher and her boyfriend too.

1l534a4	Hello, Im looking for an older film	**Hey everyone,** As the title says, Im looking for an older movie. It was shown sometime between 2000 and 2004 on Premiere, which was a subscription-based TV service here in Germany, similar to Netflix nowadays. Heres what I remember about the film: Two people get kidnapped. I'm not exactly sure, but I think they were two men  one a bit older, the other probably in his 20s or 30s. Im also not sure if the kidnapper was acting alone. They travel around the country in a van  possibly in the U.S. At some point, they end up in what looks like a motel, but I think the room they stay in is more like a cabin. Somehow, they manage to tie the kidnapper to a chair and inject him with a drug cocktail, trying to kill him  but he survives. Ive already asked ChatGPT, but none of the suggestions matched. So Im hoping someone here might recognize the movie. Thanks in advance!	Hello, Im looking for an older film **Hey everyone,** As the title says, Im looking for an older movie.

1kdatro	Trying to find a TV movie seen in the early 2000s  ghost girl in yellow dress, possibly a ballerina, haunting her family after suicide	Plot &amp; memorable scenes:  A blonde or light brown-haired teenage girl (or possibly younger) is one of the central characters.  She is sitting in a car with her mother, then opens the door and jumps out / falls out, presumably to commit suicide.  Later, she appears again wearing a yellow dress, haunting or reappearing to the family.  Her sibling (brother or sister) sees her from a window  possibly after her death.  Theres a notable scene of the mother sitting on a porch / veranda, either grieving or speaking to her daughter.  The girl may have been a ballerina or had scenes involving ballet / dance.  The tone was dark, heavy, emotional, and had elements of psychological thriller or supernatural drama  not gory horror. Any idea what movie this could be? Even partial matches or guesses are welcome!

1li9gd0	Scary shower scene in a movie trailer	Puzzle for you. When I was a kid in the late 70s/early 80s, a trailer for a horror movie freaked me out. A person was cautiously approaching a closed shower curtain. As they reached out to pull it open, a clawed hand of some creature reached out from behind the curtain and grabbed their wrist. Thats it. Thats all I got. A half remembered scene from a trailer 45-ish years ago. If it helps, Im sure this was the ad for tv, not a theater add. To this day, I still get just a tad twitchy when a shower curtain is closed. Id love to watch it today and laugh at what Im sure is a cheesy monster.

1kevzmk	80s? Horror Movie.	So the movie is about a family, mother, father, older brother, middle sister, young boy, who move into a house. But the oldest brother starts getting strange from an implied possession and he stays away from. The family and staying in his attic room. Eventually the movie ""implies"" that he seduces his younger sister and then ultimately kills his entire family. Possibly relayed, I think it might start with an old person dying in the house and cutting themselves on a strange lamp EDIT: Solved! THANK YOU! I saw these movies LONG ago, like back in elementary school. I thought they were a fever dream and it's because I was mixing scenes from both movies together! Thank you everyone!	80s? Horror Movie.

1l4xb4m	Name? About 2 estranged brothers in a segregated futuristic society	This movie was played during a free period in class when I was in like middle school, it was an older movie even back then. What I know: Live action Sci-fi What I think I know: Disney Plot: Two brothers (white) were raised together, but at their coming-of-age, the government separated them stating that one brother was elite, and in a higher caste while the other brother had a minor health problem that destined he be a worker in the lower ranks. I believe the ""defective"" brother snuck into the area where the ""elites"" lived and did so until he found his brother where they had a confrontation I think they swam a great distance in the ocean (defective trying to prove they're equals), and the elite brother starts to drown. The defective brother brings him to safety and they reconcile. It was an older movie (90s or older) but the setting was supposed to be somewhat futuristic (sci-fi). I haven't been able to find it for the life of me lol	Name?

She kind of reminded me of Tippi Hendren, and there was a man, but the room was full of dolls..like, porcelain kind of, taking small bites out of her everywhere. I don't remeber how they escaped. I just remeber running to my room and getting rid of dolls. My Aunt thinks it was a twilight zone. I don't THINK it was puppet master. It was 1988 WHEN I saw it, but it seemed much older.

1la5asx	Im being gaslit by the internet	Whats the movie where a family moves to a small town to give the father (who was an author) inspiration for his novel. His wife is a bad interior designer and his daughter plays an instrument. He goes into town, watches some musical performance and ends up being introduced to a drug that will help him write. If Im not mistaken I remember it being blood but maybe not. This drug helps him immensely but he becomes somewhat of a zombie and starts losing time and eventually his daughter gets into it to help her playing. Thats all I really remember of it.

At one point in the beginning the little boy ends up getting in the babys crib and the mom was freaking out until she found him in there. That is literally all I can remember.

They are a wealthy family and at some point after assuming to role of the hero, he comes across some giant alien baby and takes it back to his home. The hero goes from being normal human size to several stories tall and from what I can remember is not liked by the public due to causing lots of damage to the city when fighting. This is hurting my brain so I hope someone can help haha.	Can't remember superhero movie I watched a movie recently about a superhero who took over the name and role from his father after he died.

A person had been murdered (stabbed to death with scissors?) and the person who was accused of killing them was on death row I think? In the flash back someone is leaning in to hear the accused say something. Later in the film you find out the accused didn't say anything, they just kissed the person on the cheek.

1k6zmij	70's TV movie that no one remembers but me	For a long time I've been searching for the name of a made-for-TV movie from the 70's and I've yet to find someone who even remembers it. It is NOT Doberman Patrol, a similar-themed movie from the same decade. In Doberman Patrol, a man is locked in a department store after hours and is trying to escape the guard dogs. The movie I remember opens with a security guard locking up an office complex at the end of the work day. He lets a guard dog out into the lobby. There is a worker in the complex who might have fallen asleep at this desk or something but he wakes up and comes down the elevator to find the place locked up. The dog comes at him and he flees back to the elevator. At the same time, there is a guy who had stowed away in the complex to rob it or do some criminal mischief. Both the worker and the criminal realize they're not alone in the building when they see the elevator lights going through the floors and they play cat and mouse trying to avoid each other. I forget how it ends. I've searched thru movie databases and haven't found anything close to this. Incidentally, Doberman Patrol has also been released under the title Trapped, from 1973.	70's TV movie that no one remembers but me For a long time I've been searching for the name of a made-for-TV movie from the 70's and I've yet to find someone who even remembers it.

At some point, one of our wedding crashers comes with an elderly woman saying ""I found aunt Betty !"", and the groom is like ""Come meet my aunt"" while the bride is all ""grandma, finally you came"", and that's how they end up discovering that they are actually related... The groom is crushed, basically he is not really pretty, his face looks like hé is mentally challenged, like trisomy or something alike. And he basically realize that he may have lost his only shot at love. At some point, one of the crashers takes up the mic again, saying that after considération, it appears that they have sufficient séparation in the family tree to consider still getting married and taking the risk...

He's pretty sure it was a japanese movie and most probably in black and white. He remembers following details about the movie: After a traffic accident, a middle-aged man in a hospital begins a conversation with a woman, with a curtain separating them. When the curtain is removed, we see an older woman. After being discharged from the hospital, the man and woman meet several more times, and with each encounter, the woman appears younger. During their final meeting, the woman is a five-year-old girl. Any suggestions?	An old japanese movie, most probably in black and white Hello.

During their final meeting, the woman is a five-year-old girl. Any suggestions?	0	1	0	0	0	0	55	613	669	10	102	112	6.010000000000002	8.39070754716981	8.78224137931035	6	NA	NA	1	NA	NA	NA	5	5
1lc0vs8	Can anyone help me with the name of this horror movie/show , seen in early/mid nineties on tv	I have always wondered what movie/show this was since seeing as a kid. Aired early to mid nineties when I was 5/7 years old. Somewhere around then on cable TV There was a man and woman, they go to this old mansion, can't remember why. While there at least one of them drinks or eats some kind of green goo. Then it shows their body melt an turn into the goo, all of these creatures come out of rooms of the house and eat the person's body while it turns into the goo while the head remains, seems like there may have been a person at the mansion in control of the creatures.Later on it shows the woman's head in the hospital, while the man looks, and talks to her, head only no body. I know it's vague an a long shot, but I seen this as a kid an ive wonderd about it for 25 years , never could identify it. I could never remember much more , but I remember it scared the crap out of me as a kid, and those are the parts I remembered.

1lbret1	I need this movie most desperately! Very vague, please do your best.	SOLVED!!! IT WAS SEE YOU IN THE MORNING! THANK YOU ALL THAT HELPED I have remembered this movie for years but havent had the opportunity to watch it. All I can remember is basic stuff, like the tagline. This is probably most important. Its something like this. Hes got her kids. Shes got his. But wheres the kids of her? ITS SOMETHING LIKE THAT, as far as Im aware. Basic like idea of the movie is that there are three people, each with their own kids; two women, one man. One of these pairs of kids ends up missing in the transaction of people, kind of. The movie is a light hearted family comedy, and from the looks of the people in the movie poster (judging by their hair), the movie appears to have come out in the 80s. I cant find it anywhere, please help!!	I need this movie most desperately! Very vague, please do your best. SOLVED!!! IT WAS SEE YOU IN THE MORNING!

1l90tum	Indian film, period piece	Trying to remember the name of an Indian film I streamed a few years back. Opening scene had a woman in a white dress under the control of some men, and a different group of men objected to the way she was treated. In the background was a British outpost and they got involved after the two groups of men started fighting. It has the tone of an old Western. Watching RRR now and it had a similar vibe of being outrageous and epic at the same time. Thanks for suggestions!

1laqtsc	Action movie with time traveling/manipulating	Edit: gonna put this list here coz there are some crazy suggestions being thrown at me. Films that it is NOT: ARQ, in time, about time, predestination, bttf, anon, 7 splinters in time, looper, FAQ about time travel, primer, equals, tenet, source code. I saw a movie on Netflix, made after 2010. A man (somebody like Clive Owen) gets involved in some bad dealings and there's a bit of a time traveling thing going on. He tries to make a deal with some other men under a large skyscraper, very brutalist style, concrete and grey. At one point he meets a woman in a cafe and goes back to her apartment but he leaves after a bit. There's a knock at the door and it's the same man again but he's out of breath and the woman is surprised and exclaims that he ""was quick to come back"" but it turns out that it was himself but the future version. At a later part of the film it shows the ""future"" guy going to the apartment after being in a fight (or something) which explains why he was out of breath. EDIT:this scene plays out as the protag is in the apartment and the woman answers the door but won't let the guest in, from our perspective we think that the visitor at the door would be the woman's ex, but the same scene in the future we see that it's the guy who wants to get in. At the end of the film he's sat in a café next to a window explaining his situation to the woman and how he ""has time now"".

1lgf3s9	please help my dad find this movie	Hi, my dad needs help. He watched a movie in the mid 80s that he can't remember the name of. So this movie: \- came out in the 80s or earlier \- the actors were speaking either english or french (but most likely english) \- In the beggining of the movie a man saves another man that was either poor or criminal. This scene took place on the beach (or forest) in the rainy day. \- My dad is not sure but he thinks that later it turns out that the saved man was rich or he gave the inheritance for the man that saved him.	please help my dad find this movie Hi, my dad needs help.

1k7aohq	Old action movie about a pilot that I can't remember (maybe spoilers?)	There was this stupid movie I watched like 4 times when I was little and I can't for the life of me remember it. So it's about this disgraced pilot (he was labeled a coward because he didn't fight in this war), his best friend, and his ex-girlfriend and they all have to go on some adventure. At one point there at this mysterious monastery I think. If I remember correctly there was a twist where the reason the pilot was disgraced was because the girlfriend actually cut the fuel and made it so he couldn't join the fight because she thought he would die. I would very much appreciate if someone could tell me what this is so I can sleep at night.	Old action movie about a pilot that I can't remember (maybe spoilers?)

1lfbb1g	Thriller, 19972001. The protagonist's neighbor is a fugitive serial killer. Please help me find the title, I've been looking for this movie for years.	Solved: it was Arlington Road! Theres a movie that keeps popping into my mind from time to time, but Ive never been able to identify it. I've searched on Google, asked ChatGPT, and even browsed the full filmography of an actor I suspect might be in it, still nothing. This is probably the first time Im asking on Reddit, and Im really hoping someone here recognizes it. I remember watching this film on TV with my mother, and even she has no memory of it, which is starting to make it feel like some sort of fever dream. I must have been between 7 and 11 years old, so I likely saw it between 1997 and 2001. It aired in prime time on an Italian TV channel (if any Italians are reading, Im talking about *Canale 5*). I *think* the movie might be American, but Im not completely sure. Theres a scene that made me think it was from the US, Ill explain below. Heres what I remember: The film opens with a young boy running down the street. He isnt shown clearly at first, I believe at one point only his shoes are visible as he runs. Eventually, the camera shows the boys hand, badly injured by a firecracker, held tightly to his chest. From this point, my memory is hazy. I believe hes helped by his fathers new neighbor. The mother is nowhere to be seen. I dont know if the boy is motherless or if she's just not part of the story, but the father starts getting to know this new neighbor. I have a vague memory of the actor playing the neighbor. I think it might have been **Philip Seymour Hoffman**, but after checking his filmography I didnt find anything that matches. Maybe it was someone who looked like him? In any case, at some point, the boys father begins to feel suspicious about the neighbor and starts investigating him. Theres one scene I clearly remember: the father goes to what looks like a library or archive, where he reads old newspapers on a screen. We dont really have anything like that in Italy, and Ive only seen those kinds of setups in American movies, thats what makes me think this might be a US film. I also remember the ending pretty clearly. Eventually, the father realizes the neighbor is a fugitive serial killer. The father tries to escape by car (cant remember if the son is with him or not). But once hes in the car, it explodes. I believe the explosion is shown from a distance, maybe even from the neighbors point of view as he watches. I think thats actually how the film ends. Does any of this ring a bell for anyone? I know the description is a bit patchy, but Id really appreciate any help.	Thriller, 19972001. The protagonist's neighbor is a fugitive serial killer.

There was a mentally childlike adult man and another kidnapper, I think it was the mother of the man, they locked the girls in the basement, the other girl was hallucinating from trauma, and the other one wanted her to wake up from it, and she did from time to time. I also think there was a scene where the other girl had the kidnapper put make up on her and act as a doll bc if the man found out she was real he would rip the girl apart.

1l8vvg8	Shadow of a figure with beak in the shower	I once saw a scene in TV with a man in, what looked like, public showers. It was all white and he was washing himself with some soap. Behind him was either white tiled wall or white shower curtain, I'm not sure. Behind that curtain was a figure of a person, presumably male, with a beak like as if it was wearing a bird mask. This figure was walking from one side to the other and the man seemed unaware of its presence. Maybe because it was just some shadow/ghost. Again I'm not sure. But you could still hear the sound of fast footsteps on the wet tiles and someone's whistling. Either the man's or some other person's that was in the public showers. I've seen this somewhere around late 00's and early 10's. I don't even know if it was a scene in the movie, series or commercial. It might've been anything at this point. I have to find it. It haunts me to this day.	Shadow of a figure with beak in the shower I once saw a scene in TV with a man in, what looked like, public showers.

1lfhmxb	Movie where the main character keeps seeing the number ""11"" - sees a little girl with the same eyes as his lover that passed away?	It ha sa science fiction vibe to it; I think it was about a college professor that met a woman whom eventually passed away and has some sort of connection with aliens, as shown at the end. Watched this around 2017, if that helps.	Movie where the main character keeps seeing the number ""11"" - sees a little girl with the same eyes as his lover that passed away?

1lhk7xe	Which zombie / infection film is this?	My daughter and I are trying to figure out what Zombie or otherwise infection themed film we're remembering watching together. We probably watched it a couple years ago (to rule out super new releases) In it, a woman is cutting vegetables (possibly tomatoes?) in the kitchen, cuts her fingers (possibly severs them), and bleeds black blood. I believe it's a family of 4, possibly 5. The dad and the daughter are the central figures, and the dad may wind up getting the infection himself, which possible spoiler: &gt;!prompts him to self sacrifice (possibly by throwing himself off the roof of a building) to protect his daughter before the infection takes over, possibly leaving her in the care of another person that he meets on the way.!&lt; The possibles are because I've seen a lot of infection / zombie themed films in 40 years, so I don't know for sure which aspects might be bleedovers from other films. Edit: I figured out that the finger scene was instead from the film Maggie, and there were tomatoes in the background (where the finger was being dealt with) during ""the finger scene."" So, while it didn't fit perfectly, that scene has at least been figured out, so I'm fairly certain that we're combining a pair of films at this point, so will still need to figure out the source of the other memory that we're blending with Maggie. Edit: closed, thanks u/raulmonkey, it was the rooftop scene from World War Z for the second memory that was getting mixed in there.	Which zombie / infection film is this?

1le7mrv	Need help identifying this weird horror movie I watched years ago pls	The main character is a tall, lonely Caucasian man, probably living alone. He doesnt own a TV, so at one point, he draws a television on the wall and sits in front of it like hes watching it. Later in the movie, a woman comes back to his house (possibly a date or someone he met). When shes getting ready to leave, he blocks the door. She laughs nervously, thinking hes joking  but it turns out hes completely serious and wont let her go. I dont remember if he hurt her, killed her, or held her hostage  the ending is fuzzy. The tone was unsettling, very quiet and creepy, not a slasher. It felt more psychological, but definitely horror. Pretty sure it was a full-length film, not a short or anthology segment.

1kfqk6p	Forgotten horror movie	So, I watched this movie as a young kid, it was late at night and aired on television (nothing fancy just a random free channel), and I remember bits and pieces of it but I can't seem to think of the name. The few details I remember are that this family of four (I believe) a mother, father, eldest was a girl and youngest was a boy (I think, may have been more kids but I only remember two I think there may have been a third (maybe another girl?) When they moved into the new house, they had a basement, and there was this small closet/cellar in a corner, and inside was some kind of demon? I don't think we ever saw the full thing, just eyes and mouth. I remember that the daughter at one point broke a window on the second floor, I think, and jumped to escape amidst the chaos of the demon reeking havoc. I think the movie was from any where between the 80s to very late 90s early 2000s and I think I remember another movie coming on after it that was related to it, or maybe I'm bluring two movies together??? I don't know, but I really want to find this movie and just can't seem to! All that comes up is ""The cellar"" (1989), which isn't it! Solved!

1le0lhk	Need help finding this movie	So i know this is probably a longshot, but here goes... I'm looking for the name of a movie but only remember bits and pieces. I believe it came out around 2015-2020, but it could be as early as 2010. There was some sort of facility or bunker (possibly government run) where everyone is told to stay inside cuz the air outside was contaminated. There were soldiers or security officers with guns, to maintain order. There was 2 teens (siblings maybe) that snuck outside and realized the air was fine and that they were all being lied to. I think the teens' parents were also living in the facility, and one parent (mom i believe) got sick and was quarantined and the teens weren't allowed to see her. The teens start sneaking around the facility to find out what happened to their mom. Idr if they were told the mom died but it was a lie and the people in charge were actually doing experiments or something on her? After they realize they are being lied to, that's when they decide to escape from the facility. I don't know if they were allowed back inside. I remember it as a disaster/survival type drama, but i could be mixing it up with another movie. I can't remember much else, except that it seemed to be a sterile facility.

1lgvyok	What is this lost Martial Arts/Action Film? 1970s to 1990s (a hard one to find)	Please note: It is like a hybrid of American Samurai, Bloodsport, The Quest, Mortal Kombat, Bloodist 2, Best Of The Best 2 &amp; Gladiator Cop but is 100% not these films and is more realistic and has no mystical elements. Description: The film was in English, I would say the year was anywhere between 1970 to late 1990s. It had a hero (main character) who was an American Navy Seal, I think he was white. I believe from memory he is trying to infiltrate this area or base and he is captured on a mission or seeking his brother who is murdered or captured to. I do recall before the main action of the film starts, there was a build up of the story before all of the fights. Just confirmed recently by another reddit user who has seen it to, there was a love interest in the film. A blonde haired woman with almost unnatural sparkling blue eyes. There is a few scenes with her in the film to. The main (bad guy) was this very well built muscular and big Asian man (Chinese or Japanese) with a fully shaved head and bald. He had a fu man chu style facial hair. He wore a black/grey top but was mainly topless (when fighting) and his wrists had leather bracers. He also wore long black pants and black boots. From memory this is the crime boss's main enforcer. This guy and the crime boss was the target of the main character. There was also another bad guy or villain in the movie to. Another Asian man with another fu man chu facial hair or goatee and his hair was black and long. He wore from memory an all black gi that was a sleevless top to. He had black leather wrist gaunlets with long black pants and black shoes and had an athletic build. He reminded me of Shang Tsung from Mortal Kombat Conquest in a way. This guy was also the crime boss's 2nd enforcer. I remember a particular scene of this guy at some point in the movie, entering this building through like a prison cell door. He then turned around and closed the door behind him and then he walked along this upper catwalk or walkway with a menacing walk and it had like a sideview camera angle of him while walking with some eerie music playing. He then went to go and sit down next to the crime boss and watch people fight in brutal deathmatches above the pit. (I think this is the guy who kills the main characters brother). What stood out about this guy was, he had very long black hair with a long braid. In his braid there was a hidden blade with a weight. He was the only fighter with a weapon and would use his braid as a weapon and flip around alot like a ninja and swing his braid around and cut people up with his hair. He would use all of the momentum from his flipping around to toy with fighters. This guy specifically had a few stand out fights in the film. A few fighting scenes with him I remember were: One fight he was dancing and flipping around, just toying with his opponent. (Using the wushu or capoeira fighting style to do it). Eventually he beat his opponent to death. Another fight I remember he started slicing a guy with his hair slowly and then either strangled the guy to death with his braid or caught him in the throat with the hair blade which killed him. Then the final fight from memory he had in the film I remember was when he was against the hero. The hero faces him and the blade fighter's braid gets caught by the hero or something happens where he makes a mistake and slips where he is then stabbed to death with his own hair blade. Eventually after the bad blade guy is defeated by the hero. There is a final fight against the main villain, (the big bald muscular asian guy) against the hero. This movie was some sort of crime/action movie where people are fighting in illegal deathmatches and they are held prisoner by this wealthy gang or crime syndicate. The winner of the competition gets a massive some of money in the millions which was always on display above the pits near the crime boss. The movie was very dark, gritty and ultraviolent. The fights took place in some rich castle or prison like environment in Eastern Europe, Russia or somewhere in Asia. (I'm not too sure on this). The people would fight on a big dirtpit or sandpit in some kind of death pit. As I said previously, the main bad guys would sit up above and watch, almost like they enjoyed it all and there was a lot of money involved. I feel like there was a rectangular or squarish big black prison cage that had steel bars surrounding the fights on the sandpit. The cage might be mistaken for a large cell block though. As It was like an open abandoned cell block or abandoned prison with a mortar owned by the gang or crime boss. I think bodies were thrown down a drain or chute when people were killed and you had to kill your opponent in order to advance (Gladiator style). The movie was sadistic, depraved, violent and very brutal. Which is why it has stuck with me and everyone else who has seen it for so long. Please feel free to ask me as many questions in the comments for any more information. I hope this film resurfaces soon. Thank you in advance guys.

This movie was some sort of crime/action movie where people are fighting in illegal deathmatches and they are held prisoner by this wealthy gang or crime syndicate. The winner of the competition gets a massive some of money in the millions which was always on display above the pits near the crime boss. The movie was very dark, gritty and ultraviolent. The fights took place in some rich castle or prison like environment in Eastern Europe, Russia or somewhere in Asia. (I'm not too sure on this). The people would fight on a big dirtpit or sandpit in some kind of death pit. As I said previously, the main bad guys would sit up above and watch, almost like they enjoyed it all and there was a lot of money involved. I feel like there was a rectangular or squarish big black prison cage that had steel bars surrounding the fights on the sandpit. The cage might be mistaken for a large cell block though. As It was like an open abandoned cell block or abandoned prison with a mortar owned by the gang or crime boss. I think bodies were thrown down a drain or chute when people were killed and you had to kill your opponent in order to advance (Gladiator style). The movie was sadistic, depraved, violent and very brutal. Which is why it has stuck with me and everyone else who has seen it for so long. Please feel free to ask me as many questions in the comments for any more information. I hope this film resurfaces soon. Thank you in advance guys.	0	1	0	0	0	0	79	5050	5130	15	953	968	0.8049999999999997	7.317938738454256	7.26045267489712	24	NA	NA	11	NA	NA	NA	5	3
1kgvws4	Please help me find this movie so I can sleep well at night...	I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid. I remember it very vaguely so the details probably are not exact. It has to have been made some time between 2010 and. It almost had a Legend of Zelda (the new one) kind of feel. There is this man who is in this video game like world (No, it's not Free Guy or Ready Player One) and he meets this girl who he then has a kid with. They are all very happy until one day the kid gets kidnapped (maybe the wife too I can't remember). He goes on a journey to get them back and picks up some help (I don't remember exactly if it was mystical creatures or real people but I'm very certain that it had a mystical creature element). He brings them all together to fight this man who has his son (and possibly wife) and when he finds him and they go to war, the guy has all these magical powers and says he is some kind of hacker. He is keeping the son in a floating yellowish orb. He finally gets close to defeating the ""hacker"" guy but then the hacker dude freezes time and everything goes black and white. Everything is frozen except the main dude and the hacker guy. The hacker guy tries to tell him none of it is real and I'm pretty sure that the hacker guy lets him win and as the main character is about to touch his son, there is a flash of light and he wakes up in this tank like thing and gets out and he is just at this video game fair thing testing the newest tech. It was very emotional for him because he had just gone through a life where he met the love of his life and had a son, but now he must face the fact that none of it was real. Edit: I did find the movie thanks to user [jnires](https://www.reddit.com/user/jnires/). The movie is Dragon Quest you story. My memory of the movie was a bit off but I did find it.

1lezmu1	Looking for a movie but not much to go on	Solved. It's Invaders from Mars (1986). I remember seeing a movie when I was younger but I can't even pinpoint a general idea on year. All I remember from it, are military people getting pulled into sand, and ending up inside some caves or something. I remember a scene where a guy was walking and then the sand started shifting in a circle pattern and then the guy starts getting dragged down. He tried to hold on and pull himself out but gets sucked in. Next scene is him falling down to the ground in a cave system. Pretty sure a whole group of them got pulled down because remember them getting into formation and holding guns in the caves.	Looking for a movie but not much to go on Solved.

Later on, as they are walking again, they suddenly hear a click sound and they all stop walking immediately because land mines make that sound when stepped on. The soldier who stepped on the mine needs to stay in place and not move or the mine would explode. He stays that way for most of the movie.

1ljvas0	80s or 90s horror movie that aired on tv from 1994-1995. Also could be from a series. Been looking for 10 years	I saw a movie or tv series when I was a kid that scared me really bad. The only problem is I dont have much memory of too many scenes only one in particular. This aired on tv approximately 1994-1995 during the day time based on where I was living at the time. The one scene I remember very vividly is a villain or character accessing a mans home through the garage door using a numeric keypad code located on the garage or house. I vividly remember the fingers pressing in the code and the suspense that followed. This scene really sticks out in my mind. I also want to say the garage door opening and revealing who was trying to get in. I think there was a man (it was only one character) hiding in the house from whatever it was. Im also leaning more towards late 80s or early 90s it didnt appear too old. There was a scene with fire too not too long after maybe whatever was trying to get catching fire cause thats when I screamed for my dad lol. But yea the scene I remember really well was the nails or fingers pressing the code and something happening to get inside the house. There is a chance this was also the main character entering the house to hide but I remember it being really suspenseful. Its not are you afraid of the dark because it was much more adult horror! X files doesnt ring a bell cause I cant find it but I could be missing something!	80s or 90s horror movie that aired on tv from 1994-1995. Also could be from a series.

I think it was the summer of 1987 on summer vacation when late at night I came across a movie about a group of home invaders who make their way into a house with a teenage girl home alone and hold her hostage as they rob the place. The girl's boyfriend comes over because they had a date and the girl answers the door and tries to get rid of him, so he doesn't get taken hostage too by saying she's feeling sick, and the date is off. This all I remember of the plot. I should mention that I don't think anyone famous was in it and one of the home invaders was female. It's been 38 years, and I haven't found **anything** on this movie. Can you help?	Can you name the movie I saw on HBO in 1987?

1la0vb8	Trying to find an old movie: masked teens go place to place, one dies in each scene	I saw this movie as a kid (probably around 2005 or earlier) on a rental DVD in Japan (Japanese dubbed). Heres what I remember: - It was a foreign film (likely American or European), possibly released in the 1990s or early 2000s. - It featured a group of wealthy teens (boys and girls, maybe 6 in total). - They wore different types of masks. One of them wore a blank, white mask like the Japanese performer from Golden Bomber (very expressionless). - They were rebelling against adults/society in some way. - They moved from place to place  not just one location like a mall  and in each place, one of them died (often by being shot). - The deaths looked symbolic or acted, not gory or realistic  more like theatrical portrayals. - The police and their parents tried to talk to them, but the kids didnt respond or were not convinced. - The group got smaller and smaller. In the end, I think the leader (a boy) was the last one remaining. - The overall vibe was eerie, symbolic, and felt a bit low-budget or old in terms of video quality. It wasnt a slasher or horror film  more like a psychological or symbolic thriller with social commentary. Does anyone recognize this?

1kpwj0f	Movie from childhood??	I've had this movie that I watched ages ago stuck on my mind and I cannot for the life of me remember the name or any scene enough to get a straight answer from google. The movie (I'm pretty sure) is about a man and his daughter. The man is a bit of an alcoholic and gets into some kind of car accident or something. The girl, his daughter, happens to be in her school bus and witnesses it. She's doing her makeup in the back of the bus - pretty sure there's a fake mole, blue eyeshadow, and overly filled in eyebrows (classic kids playing around with makeup for the first time). From the back of the bus this guys daughter can see what happens and then somehow gets to the hospital where her dad is. There's a scene where she's with him the hospital and she's crying and a tear drops from her heavily mascaraed eyelash and onto him... can't remember if it was in his mouth or on his cheek or somewhere else. Another big part of the movie (that I think I'm remembering correctly unless my childhood memories are smashing to very different movies together) but viewers are able to see what the characters eat. Kind of like with Inside Out and the characters/emotions in the brain, in this movie the the stomach is personified?? Like whenever the dad eats or drinks something a scene change goes into his stomach and there's little figures in there taking notes on what he ate and whether or not it's good for him. I remember a specific scene where either dad or daughter is eating those graham cracker bears or teddy grahams and it flows through the digestive track and into the stomach and the stomach figure people make comments on the choice of snack. Am I crazy?? I swear this is real and I need to find it because it's driving me insane.	Movie from childhood??

1lg8t9f	Please help me identify this movie/video - 90s horror???	Sometime in the 1990s, I was about to leave an old friends house (person unreachable, so I cant ask her). And about 10 minutes before I left, she put a movie into the VHS/DVD player. I remember seeing this scene which was either the intro to the movie or possibly a trailer. It was a relatively short abstract/seemingly animated scene where a real (non animated) head was shown being cut open at the top (full top of scalp), and pulled off exposing the brain. Then a voice came on saying the name of the movie as the movie title was splashed on the screen in an almost comical/whimsical font. Heres the kicker. My mind wants to remember it as the 1991 horror film Popcorn, BUT I have watched the movie and watched every trailer I can find on YouTube, and none of them show this brain scene Im remembering. So I wonder if Popcorn is even the correct film. Can anyone remember this? Edit: This could have been an 80s thing for all I know. I just know that I saw it in friends house in the 90s.

And about 10 minutes before I left, she put a movie into the VHS/DVD player. I remember seeing this scene which was either the intro to the movie or possibly a trailer. It was a relatively short abstract/seemingly animated scene where a real (non animated) head was shown being cut open at the top (full top of scalp), and pulled off exposing the brain. Then a voice came on saying the name of the movie as the movie title was splashed on the screen in an almost comical/whimsical font. Heres the kicker. My mind wants to remember it as the 1991 horror film Popcorn, BUT I have watched the movie and watched every trailer I can find on YouTube, and none of them show this brain scene Im remembering. So I wonder if Popcorn is even the correct film. Can anyone remember this? Edit: This could have been an 80s thing for all I know. I just know that I saw it in friends house in the 90s.	0	1	0	0	0	0	56	991	1048	9	187	196	8.89777777777778	7.36820561637316	7.312000000000001	30	NA	NA	14	NA	NA	NA	12	10

If I had to describe the animation Id say it was similar to the style of the 1989 animated BFG movie. Not a lot to go on sorry. Been bugging me for twenty years at least.

1l8eqk3	Looking for a teen/adult sex comedy from the 2000searly 2010s	I've been trying to find this bizarre sex comedy movie I saw sometime in the late 2000s/ maybe early 2010s, it could have been made early than that, it was just the approximate year I watched it. It might have been a french film, the version I saw was dubbed in French but my parents used to watch all movies dubbed in french so maybe it was not. It was a long time ago and I was a kid so heres what I remember: The story follows two male virgins, (maybe adults, maybe teenagers), who are trying to lose their virginity, and look like dorks or geeks. One of them is quiet, and the other is louder, both are perverts. The quiet one always wears a bucket hat, which was basically his signature look throughout the film. Theres a scene where the quiet one records his neighbors having sex through the window, and its played as creepy/perverted. Theres a weird visual gag where when they get an erection, usually from flirting or seeing a woman, their penis becomes comically hugelike an over-the-top, CGI-style visual joke. In the end of the movie they both get girlfriends and loose they're virginity, (I think the girls were potrayed as ugly, not sure) The humor was really childish, almost slapstick or cartoonish, but still had very adult content (sex, nudity, etc.). I remember thinking it was kind of dumb and absurd, but its a memory from my childhood I occasionally think about.

1kiny44	Long Shot	When I was kid (late 80s, early 90s) I saw part of a movie. It gives me the vibe of a made for tv movie (was that a thing back then?) or maybe it was an episode of a show, but I doubt that. It was a thriller/horror, and for SOME reason, I envision Carol Burnett playing this Whatever happened to Baby Jane vibe character. (i think) I was literally maybe 6yo when I saw it on tv. I don't think it's Carol Burnett, I've checked her imdb, but may have over looked this role. But it's a female, dressed sort of clownish, with bright orange curly hair in pigtails, and clownish makeup, and in this scene, I believe she's coming down the hallway, toward the camera, toward some stairs, and I think she was in someone's house. And she's, like, threatening, she's obviously off her rocker. This particular scene scared me, and just fed into my already existing fear of clowns. So it's always stayed in my memory, but I can't figure out what it was.	Long Shot When I was kid (late 80s, early 90s) I saw part of a movie.

1lillql	Help me find this movie from eastern Europe	Hi everyone! Long time ago, and that is more than 30 years ago, we had this movie on kids program on TV. It was about two siblings ( syster and a brother) that were on a scientific field trip with school to a museum (I think) when they enter a grandfather clock and go back in time.

Help me find this movie from eastern Europe Hi everyone! Long time ago, and that is more than 30 years ago, we had this movie on kids program on TV. It was about two siblings ( syster and a brother) that were on a scientific field trip with school to a museum (I think) when they enter a grandfather clock and go back in time. Every time they pass a door the time changes. They go through the history of that city by passing through doors.

1klkc4q	Late 80s early 90s movie with a murderous teen	I only saw a small bit but there are 3 scenes I remember: Main character is a teen/older teen, blonde hair with bangs/fringe (think young leo) and he murders a man who they seem to have a contentious relationship (father/stepfather?) in the living room while a chained up dog is barking. He goes to a girls house where she is flirty or drunk and he smothers her with a pillow. He goes to another girls house, probably the main love interest, and he is all upset and crying while she comforts him.

1kptmnk	Late 80s Early to Mid 90s Movie	Please help! Over a decade trying to remember the name of this movie. This movie is about a troubled young man, late teens to early 20s. He went to live with relatives to get a new start. He arrives late at night and had little time to catch up. His cousin took him to his living area, a back house that was covered with foliage or something, not easy to locate if you didn't know it was there. Next morning, he woke up to greet his family in the main house but they were all dead, brutally murdered. I think the rest of the movie he is running from the murderers, trying to figure out who they are and what was is their motive. Thanks in advance!	Late 80s Early to Mid 90s Movie Please help!

1lhx1lq	Movie With Blonde Female Cop and Multiple Twists	So I can't remember much about this movie, other than it didn't get great reviews, but I liked it as a kid. I remember there are multiple twists upon twists throughout the film, and it ends with the main character, a short-haired, blonde female cop actually being recruited to some agency or something. I apologize for not having more to go off of. I want to say it was an early 2000s film. Edit: Someone asked if it was Silent Hill, but no. It wasn't a horror film. The twists throughout the film are revealed to not be real and she is actually being recruited/tested the entire time. I want to say it was like a suspense thriller type film. Edit 2: I also remember a scene in slow motion outside in the rain where she sees a male character driving away or walking away, and there's one of those ""twists"" that ultimately at the end of the film turns out to NOT be a real twist. I'm sorry if this is all confusing. It's not making much sense to me either at this point. Edit 3: u/ChickenFriedApe found it!

1l8cxxf	Move from a different university?	SOLVED!!! *Unable to edit Flair* I remember this one, but I also remember another film very similar to the premise of Birth with Nicole Kidman. It was a woman who lost her husband, but her brother-in-law, which was her dead husband's brother, claimed that he's actually her husband' spirit. The wife initially did not believe that her husband was actually in his brother's body. She thought her brother-in-law was a liar, but eventually, with all the things that he knew, she figured it must be her husband coming back to life; but she realized that her brother-in-law actually just read the letters that was written to her. He studied everything down to a T and was able to Regurgitate the information as if he was him. The movie came out around 2005 to 2008. I cannot remember the actors names nor can I remember the movie title. Every time I try to look for the movie based on how I describe it, it keeps coming up with this film or other similar, but never the exact one. I feel like i watched it in an alternate universe.

1kprx5l	Please help me find this movie.	I'm on a mission to track down a movie that's been living in the dusty corners of my childhood memories, and I'm hoping someone here can help me piece it together. Here are the details I remember: * The movie kicks off with a radio broadcast urgently telling people to evacuate Earth due to an impending disaster. * The main setting involves a small group, maybe around five people, aboard a transport spaceship in a really desolate, unwelcoming part of space. * Things get really strange when deceased relatives start appearing to the crew members. I specifically remember these entities taking the forms of their loved ones  a mother, a dog, and a grandmother are the ones that stick out. * I saw this when I was very young, so my memory is super fuzzy on a lot of the specifics. Here are some more details that might jog someone's memory: * There's a scene that really freaked me out as a kid: one of the characters on the spaceship, who I think was thin, saw the being that looked like his mother actually change form. This really traumatized him. * I recall a Black actor whose dog appeared to him as one of these visitations. * A key setting in the movie was a very cold, exterior environment. I remember the characters having to wear thick thermal parkas whenever they left the spacecraft. * For some reason, I have a strong feeling that this was a television movie, not something released in theaters. * I'm guessing it aired sometime between 1979 and 1986. This has been bugging me for years! Any ideas or suggestions would be incredibly appreciated. Let me know if any of these details ring a bell for you! Thanks in advance for your help!

The mother has a white dress and opens it up but the killer says its not what they came for and kills her. Only the son hides and manages to escape. Years later he goes back to the town and he avenges himself through a string of strange and seemingly accidental deaths. Such deaths include: \-A motorhome has its wheels bolts removed and tumbles off a cliff; A person dies of asphixiation with a tennis ball; a shotgun is tampered with, exploding in the attackers face (It was the sheriff). During the movie the main charater also falls for a girl that ends up being the daughter of one of the killers and he spares her father.

Such deaths include: \-A motorhome has its wheels bolts removed and tumbles off a cliff; A person dies of asphixiation with a tennis ball; a shotgun is tampered with, exploding in the attackers face (It was the sheriff). During the movie the main charater also falls for a girl that ends up being the daughter of one of the killers and he spares her father. Thanks for the help.	1	0	1	0	1	0	24	1055	1080	4	199	203	5.240000000000002	7.954491978609628	8.193205741626794	5	2	3	3	2	0	1	1	3

I remember it featured little green aliens/men from Mars. I got the impression that the whole movie was an ad for Mars candy bars. There were kids in the movie and they befriended the aliens. I could be wrong about which candy company sponsored the movie, might not be Mars It's not ""The Last Halloween"". And it's not ""Spaced Invaders"". I just watched them. But I do think the aliens resembled the ones in ""Spaced Invaders""	90's Halloween movie with aliens and candy I remember watching a movie as a kid and I can't find it anywhere.

1kli2gr	looking for this movie for ages	It's similar to Midsommar but different characters. The female main character used to be a famous singer until she met her cowboy Christian boyfriend that changed her life. I don't remember if they got married but they went on on honeymoon? or vacation without them knowing about the weird tradition or cult over there. The locals made the main character a May Queen. At the end of the movie, the boyfriend got eaten alive by the townfolks while the main character was unal!ved and displayed among the past May Queens.	looking for this movie for ages It's similar to Midsommar but different characters.

1kgknvt	Please help me find this movie so I can sleep well at night...	I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid. I remember it very vaguely so the details probably are not exact. It has to have been made some time between 2010 and. It almost had a Legend of Zelda (the new one) kind of feel. There is this man who is in this video game like world (No, it's not Free Guy or Ready Player One) and he meets this girl who he then has a kid with. They are all very happy until one day the kid gets kidnapped (maybe the wife too I can't remember). He goes on a journey to get them back and picks up some help (I don't remember exactly if it was mystical creatures or real people but I'm very certain that it had a mystical creature element). He brings them all together to fight this man who has his son (and possibly wife) and when he finds him and they go to war, the guy has all these magical powers and says he is some kind of hacker. He is keeping the son in the floating yellowish orb. He finally gets close to defeating the ""hacker"" guy but then the hacker dude freezes time and everything goes black and white. Everything is frozen except the main dude and the hacker guy. The hacker guy tries to tell him none of it is real and I'm pretty sure that the hacker guy lets him win and as the main character is about to touch his son, there is a flash of light and he wakes up in this tank like thing and gets out and he is just at this video game fair thing testing the newest tech.

The military is moved there and bring lots of scientists. On the other side of the portal that is a farm and a family living there, like in the 1800s: The old grandpa, the mother, the father, the beautiful young adult daughter, maybe a young son and a dog. The military discovered that the portal briefly opens at certain time of the day (If a remember a bird from the farm cross the portal giving them the hint). So they put a baseball toss machine shooting the portal constantly, with soldiers refilling the machine. One of the scientists during the investigation fall in love with the young blond daughter from the other side and seems that she also fall for him. After some days, the scientist know the exactly time to cross the portal and he runs for it. Only to discover that the family are some type of vampires/ghoul/monster that gangs him up to eat him. The episode finish with the Old Grandpa in the farm opening a book and casting a ""Close Porta"" spell. It's being YEARS and I've never found this episode again and I cant remember what what show it is. Thank you in advance.

1kbbmzg	British?? Movie about a group of friends trying to save their favorite bar	So I remembered seeing this Comedy movie in one of those cable channels that had so many films from all over the world, so if I remember correctly I remember all the actors had an English accent and all film locations were probably from the UK as well as the atmosphere. The protagonists were these guys of different ages mostly middle aged and one or two young ones that used to gather at a bar. They mostly are a little dumb and a little weird There are some scenes I clearly remember and are as follows: 1 - These guys used to admire this man who liked to kick trash cans all the way into garbage trucks and the drivers would thank him for doing so, then the protagonists would try to do the same but they would fail miserably kicking the trash and falling over 2 - There is an auction almost at the end of the movie where they are selling the bar that they are trying to save, so there is this guy who fell asleep during the auction so these guys tie a string to one of his hands and whenever they wanted to outbid the rest of the buyers they would lift the string and the sleeping guy would outbid the competition by lifting his hand thanks to the string attached to one of these guys. This goes on for some times until the string gets stuck and they pull so hard they lift the guy all the way to the ceiling. Funniest scene of the movie. That's about it, probably wouldn't be enough to find the movie but since this was a one time viewing I have a hard time remembering everything. The image seemed kinda 80s old European movie format Thanks for helping!	British??

1ld1zfc	A weird movie from the 70s (probably?!)	All I remember is it's a really old movie about two couples on vacation (not sure). It looked like was set in late 19th-early 20th century (clothes, hairstyles). Now the only two memorable details I remember are: 1. Two main male characters, one with a beard and one with a moustache, were fichting naked in a room with the fireplace (it was definitely fighting unless I've repressed something=) 2. Character with a moustache goes out and freezes to death in the snow. And that's the ending as far as I remember. I hope someone else knows this movie because I feel like I dreamt it or accidentally watched some old p*rn 15 years ago and imagined the plot.	A weird movie from the 70s (probably?!)

1law3tr	~early 2000s movie where a guy survives a plane crash full of blinded passengers due to stealing all their life jackets.	I'm going crazy trying to find evidence of this movie ever existing. What I remember is this: this guy (the protag I assume) is on a commercial flight when suddenly some sort of supernatural light flashes and makes everyone onboard, including the pilots, completely blind. Everyone except this one guy, due to him sleeping and having a sleeping mask on or something. The plane is on course to crash due to this, so the guy steals over a dozen of the blind passengers inflatable life jackets and stuffs himself inside them greedily just to save himself. I believe in the end the plane crashes and everyone dies except him, due to him stealing all those life jackets for his own benefit. Any ideas? Google and AIs have been no help and I'm losing my mind, thanks!	~early 2000s movie where a guy survives a plane crash full of blinded passengers due to stealing all their life jackets.

1kmraaf	Movie about a bunch of people trying to be the last survivor in a house to win a million dollars	I believe it was a British film. Basically, a bunch of people are stuck in a house (willingly I believe) in a competition for a million dollars. To win they have to be the last one in the house. Food and drink is provided for them through an elevator thing. As time goes on, someone dies (I think they got shot?) and everyone freaks out and some want to leave but they realize they can't escape. Then the food and drink provisions are being reduced so they're fighting for survival. Eventually, one person is the last survivor and a million dollars is given to her through the elevator shoot in a large duffel bag. She stands at the door and waits for it to open. When it opens, it's revealed that it is not an exit. Instead, it's a group of dead/dying people clutching their duffel bag with a million dollars in it.

A dollhouse with real people inside and some child playing with them. --- Very fragmentary memories of them, probably because I watched them as a child.

1kp3xog	What horror movie features a scene where someone (possessed) is killed in a police car	I dont remember the scene/plot properly but its from a horror movie where I think a police officer has to transport a person who is cursed/ possessed to the hospital but on the way the person dies. UPDATE: I have remembered more details so I will add them in here. - If I recall correctly the police office was a woman - I think the person who was possessed was a child - It took her much longer than expected to arrive at the hospital Becasue she was struggling to find her way (kept taking wrong turns or something) so her superiors become suspicious of her not realising there were darker things at play	What horror movie features a scene where someone (possessed) is killed in a police car I dont remember the scene/plot properly but its from a horror movie where I think a police officer has to transport a person who is cursed/ possessed to the hospital but on the way the person dies.

Anyway so the other brother would try to save him. Honestly that's all that can remember really other than he died from poison one time. Most likely made in the 2000s the brother were both white if that helps. Please someone know what I'm thinking of this is killing me!	Please tell me someone knows what I'm talking about!!!!

1ljucwf	Childhood movie that has stumped me for years	Whenever I would go to my grandmother's house I would look through her impressive collection of VHS tapes, and I more often than not would pick this one movie. I loved it, and want to show it to my kids, but I have been trying for years to find the name on Google with no luck. It was about a kid who, with her extended family, traveled to this mansion of a recently deceased family member. I remember there was some kind of mystery they were trying to solve in the creepy old place, and maybe a creepy butler? The details get foggy. I specifically remember they mentioned the word ""Windfall"". For some reason that stuck with me. There was definitely some sense of competition on who was going to inherit the wealth. I remember it being very macabre, which explains a lot about my teenage years that followed. That's all I remember. I hope someone can help! Thanks in advance!

I suspect because its such an old movie, perhaps 40s and 50s. I only saw bits and pieces of it most likely on TCM (Turner Classic Movies). What I did see of it, it was about a family who I think were having trouble with their mortgage and a man came to their house to collect money or give them a deadline as to which to make the payment otherwise they would lose the home. The Father had his son do something to the mans car to where the man ended up having to stay there with the family and ended up really liking the family and even falling in love with the daughter.

1knj021	Looking for an animated movie with wizards that I saw when I was a kid	All I know about this movie is that two wizards have an argument and one wizard says to another that something is ""inevitable"". I know this because that's how I learned the word ""inevitable"" as a kid. The movie was definitely animated and I have the impression that the wizards were wearing robes and had beards (shocker) but no idea anything else about the story. I thought for years that this would probably be a Lord of the Rings adaptation, with Saruman telling that to Gandalf, but I've since watched every animated adaptation of The Lord of the Rings looking for it, and it wasn't any of them. Also, my very vague memory thinks that there was at least one dragon involved in the movie, and LotR doesn't have that. If it helps, I was growing up in the 90s. I got amnesia after that and this is one of the only things from before then I can remember. Please help me find this scrap of childhood if you can! Thank you!

Film with hurricane/storm shootout The scene I am finding difficult to place involves two men having a shootout in a seaside suburb that has been evacuated due to an incoming hurricane.

1lg99j4	Please help me identify this movie/video - 90s horror???	Sometime in the 1990s, I was about to leave an old friends house (person unreachable, so I cant ask her). And about 10 minutes before I left, she put a movie into the VHS/DVD player. I remember seeing this scene which was either the intro to the movie or possibly a trailer. It was a relatively short abstract/seemingly animated scene where a real (non animated) head was shown being cut open at the top (full top of scalp), and pulled off exposing the brain. Then a voice came on saying the name of the movie as the movie title was splashed on the screen in an almost comical/whimsical font. Heres the kicker. My mind wants to remember it as the 1991 horror film Popcorn, BUT I have watched the movie and watched every trailer I can find on YouTube, and none of them show this brain scene Im remembering. So I wonder if Popcorn is even the correct film. Can anyone remember this? Edit: This could have been an 80s thing for all I know, I just know I saw it in friends house in the 90s.

He says it's an old movie where the hero is 40+ and is trying to escape an army facility by cutting the fencing and is chased by them through the forest. They let loose a dog behind the hero and it gives him a really hard time. He also has to cross a water body. My dad also says the poster for the movie was the hero with his Bare body (top) and running or covering his body. Kindly help me out so that I can make him watch it movie again. I tried AI but it didn't give me the right answer.	HELP ME FIND THIS MOVIE FOR MY DAD Hi I am trying to figure out the name of an old movie which my dad watched.

1kbbac0	I watched it ~17yrs ago	[FOUND] This has been haunting me for months. I have no idea what the plot was but it had such a vibe that my preteen self emulated it in with barbie heads. I think it was a new release at the rental store, so probably came out around 2007. Its an indie film, low budget. The setting is the middle of nowhere desert in a rickety old house. There are two main characters, a father and young daughter. There might be a grandma, not sure. The father is losing his mind over something I think and might have a shotgun at some point. The daughter has funky barbie heads for friends and talks to them. They may talk back. Theres a heavy orange filter over most of the movie, if not all. There might be fishbowl effects used, but if not there was some experimental filming styles for sure. Did anyone else watch this? Does anyone remember the name?

1knly9k	That One Movie Where a Teen Trips into an MMORPG World	So, when I was a little kid, I remember watching this scene where a teenager gets bullied and punched in the woods by some typical bullies. Then, they throw him to the ground, force a pill into his mouth, and spit in it to make him swallow it. After that, the main character goes on a bad trip, seeing himself as a character from an MMORPG-type game. The whole scene is very psychedelic. This was probably around 20062008, but the movie itself was likely from the early 2000s. My parents never let me finish the movie after that scene  it was kind of disturbing  but it stuck with me for the rest of my life.

1k6ntnk	Help naming movie?	This is going to be a hard one because I remember too little about it. The main thing I remember is the characters, men, trying to join a club(loose term, maybe a secret society?) and after joining they would cut a horizontal line across their skin just below the pant line, above the crotch. It was part of the Induction process. I think they'd show each other the scar as an ""I'm one of you"" sign. MAYBE it was a white guy trying to gain the trust of Native Americans? I remember this from when I was younger, so its probably from the 90's or earlier. I literally can't remember anything else about the movie.	Help naming movie?

Please post, if even part of the plot sounds familiar because I'm not 100% sure that I'm not confusing this movie with the plot of a similar movie set in a B&amp;B, with a celeb chef in hiding.	# I'm pretty sure the movie came out between 2010 &amp; 2021. I most likely watched it on Tubi, Crackle, Hallmark, UP Faith &amp; Family or Pluto. # The plot of the movie as far as I can remember is this: a woman comes back to her hometown, where her family's diner/restaurant, (possibly set in a coastal town, or lake town), is in some kind of financial trouble. I believe the woman is a chef, caterer or some kind of event planner. Or maybe not. I just remember she helped create the new menu and she disliked the head chef at their first meeting. # She clashes with the head chef (who I believe is a well known chef, in this movie's universe), that her father hired. I think the father is planning to sell the restaurant to the celeb chef but the daughter's arrival back home changes that plan. They have different ideas of what the diner should and shouldn't serve, with her thinking that his dishes are too fancy for their diner. They eventually end up compromising as they redesign the inside of the diner and the diner's menu. # They find love along the way. It was a modern style restaurant that changed its style and menu I also remember that the diner had red and white checkered tablecloths and their were booths as well as tables and possibly out door tables too. # Some of the details could have been from another movie, I hope not. I think there also might have been another restaurant in the town that was taking their business and that was one of the reasons why they were in financial trouble.

I believe it was either British or American. In the movie, a mysterious man arrives in a small town and gives out small objectslike beads or stonesto the local children. Each child picks one randomly. If a child picks a black bead, the man takes that child away with him. The child never returns. It's implied that the man is taking the child to train or raise them to be like him, but the film doesn't explain much detail about this. The tone was mysterious and a bit fantastical, but not sci-fi or horror. The black bead seemed to symbolize being ""chosen."" The children were not harmed.

1kpanmd	A 1980's/1990's slasher with 5 adults caught in a storm at an abandoned house	\-Edit- We have a winner thanks to Stealthd0ze - Deadly Manor (1990) Hello dears! Hoping someone can help me nail down this one particular slasher/horror film. Like the title mentions, from the best of my recollections, I believe there are four friends who pick up a hitchhiker who seems suspicious. Their car breaks down or one of them, a girl, leaves and the others follow after her. They find a house with a barn and there's also a car that appears burned. A storm is starting so they first head into the barn but then see about getting into the house. There they start a fireplace and sleep. My memory gets especially hazy here. But I recollect a scene of someone drinking wine, falling asleep on a bed. A room of many picture frames of a woman, and a couple who turn up towards the end. Any help would be appreciated, bless!

1koz4oe	Im looking for a movie I watched around 1991. Probably Cinemax very late night. It was French I believe. Subtitles in English. It was a bank robbery gone bad with hostages. There was the most disgusting joke in it. I was 12 or 13 years old and Ive remembered this joke this long.	A sailer comes back from a long voyage and upon landing in Paris goes to a whore house. He asks the madam in charge for the ugliest fattest whore she has. She escorts him up to a room and he sees in the bed the fattest ugliest woman hes seen. He gets in bed and tells her he wants to eat he bellybutton out, its his fetish. So he gets in position and starts to eat it out running his face in it and he feels something in his teeth, he paused and pulled a bit of meat out of his teeth, he thinks nothing and resumes, going to town again he felt something again in his teeth and it was a piece of corn. At that point it was too much. He screams Im going to be sick. The whore shrugs and says thats what the last guy said too. Ive never forgotten the joke. It was violent. And I was too young to watch it Im sure. No other real clues. Im sure I mangled the joke. It may have been as early as 1989 but I think it was 1991. Ive searched and can not find this movie.

Theres a woman who is control of her life and seems to have an important career in an important position. Theres a man and i dont remember their relation, but this man acts like a spoiled child thats annoys her as hell, and wants to control her. He does things that complicates things for her ( for example, not that it happened in the movie, dropping plates intentionally on the floor, etc..), like a child not having its will. In the end, she gives up, and let him have his will, seemingly being his servant. In one scene you see her carrying his luggage Maybe the plot is that his father is tired of him being a childish asshole, unable to grow up. The father probably hires her to discipline and educate him, but its an impossible task for her. Tried prompting chatgpt in loads of ways but no luck. Im not sure about any of this, since i remember it very faintly, but the film was unique and very good.

1kar3vt	[TOMT] a movie or a show I watch in the 80s about a car that people are after because of the technology behind it.	SOLVED The movie is called ""DRIVING ME CRAZY"" It came out in 1991. Thanks. I don't remember the title, but it left me thinking about it all these years. From what I remember, a guy invents a car, and people are after it, obviously, to make money off of it. I don't remember much of the movie, but what I do remember is that the inventor destroys the car to prevent it from going into the wrong hands. He did this because he is the only one that can rebuild another one. That's all I remember from it. I don't know the release date cause it was shown on TV in a hotel/motel type place in the late 80s or early 90s. Thanks for your help. This movie has been bugging me for decades. Edit to add: the inventor is from Europe, I remember he had an accent. And the car runs on i believe vegetables.

1khkl82	I have vague memories of this movie from childhood.	So, I remember watching this with my parents in the early 00s. It would've been from that time or the 90s. The main character gets into a drunk fight or something, and is inspired to take kung fu. He struggles at first (obviously) but then masters it. I just remember a scene after he's a kung fu master where he's playing tennis or some kind of racket sport, and he gets hit in the balls but it doesn't affect him. Then someone is like, ""you have balls of steel!"" And he hits his balls and they make a metallic sound, demonstrating the validity of what they said. I know this is vague but it's all I remember. I've tried to find this movie many times but have never had any success.	I have vague memories of this movie from childhood. So, I remember watching this with my parents in the early 00s.

1l9w5d8	B/W movie, memorable butler with secret past.	Ive been struggling to remember the name of the movie, I think starring Cary Grant, where he had a butler with a secret past that he was protecting. The butler was a side character and Im pretty sure most of the movie did not directly deal with him until the end. The secret was that the butler had been accused of murdering his wife the body of whom was never found, found guilty and hanged, believed dead, but survived. He then found the wife alive and well and killed her thinking hed already been hanged for killing her so it was ok. He is then tried again for murdering her and hanged again. And survives again. I think he is found by the lead character who mustve been a doctor. He then goes on to be the lead characters butler for years. It comes to a head when theres some kind of political event or something where somebody discovers the butler has a secret past (but not necessarily what it actually was) and threatens to reveal it causing the lead character to get the Butlers permission to just reveal it. Help. The Google (and my family) has been of no use.	B/W movie, memorable butler with secret past.

At the end I think one girl from earth returns with them to ther planet. I remember thinking the movie looked really old. But it was sooooo gooood!!!

1lckhqe	Movie where a bunch of criminals kinda adopt an android	It was kinda cyberpunk, and had a bit of action too. The actors playing the 2 main criminals were members of a band together in real life - I think they might have been from Norway or something too, but I might be making that up. One of them had a (dyed?) mohawk and the other was like white-blonde with a very cool haircut. Over the movie, the android slowly gains more &amp; more knowledge &amp; sentience &amp; a sense of self. I watched it about a decade ago, and I think it had been released just 2 or 3 years earlier.

1l8nb27	Please help me find this movie	I watched it as a kid, so it was a long time ago. The main guy got into a fight and lost his tooth. He gave the tooth to a woman, and later, when she fell into some kind of depression, she ground the tooth into dust and ate it. The news reported that the killer had murdered the main guy and used some kind of joss/incense stick on his corpse. Roughly around 2010.

1knud1f	Horror movie from some time around 2015	It was pretty popular I think, at least at the time. Had a good amount of advertising, but I don't think it did well with ratings since I haven't heard of it since. I can hardly remember anything about it, but I know it was a paranormal horror. I think it was based in like... India? Somewhere in a tropical forest I believe, but it was American produced. She was in this beautiful, huge house and there was a fountain in the middle where the house's ceiling opened up. Pretty sure there was a scene where some kind of demon tried drowning her in it, or a scene where the water turned black like tar. I'm think it came out around 2015 because I'm pretty sure we rented it when we rented Magic Mike XXL LMAO Sorry, but that's really all I can remember. I'll definitely know the movie once I see it again.	Horror movie from some time around 2015 It was pretty popular I think, at least at the time.

1lf5bbh	2010s rom com about four people from different countries	A vageuly indie, very European movie (the languages switched pretty regularly). I can remember the plot in pretty specific detail but mostly from the trailer, which was doing the rounds at the time on youtube - there was an Italian man who, although in a relationship with someone else, developed a crush on a French girl (I think the thumbnail was her looking over her shoulder as she rides a bike? She had dark hair and dark eyes, fair skin). There was a German woman who worked as a flight attendant and one scene (also in the trailer) involved someone she was sleeping with asking her to speak German to him so she began reciting the safety awareness briefing from the beginning of every flight. She was blonde. There was a fourth person too and the tone of the movie was light-hearted hijinks as everyone confusedly fell in love with each other even though they all had somebody else. I'm pretty sure at some point the Italian man accidentally broke his French crush's leg and so offers to help take care of her kids while his partner (possibly the German woman?) is away. Keen for any leads! Thanks in advance.	2010s rom com about four people from different countries A vageuly indie, very European movie (the languages switched pretty regularly).

The entire film they looked for a serial killer. The former child star was gay and teasing or otherwise involved with a younger fan. A lesbian woman was also somehow involved with another woman in the film. A few scenes I remember: The woman buys earrings for her female friend and asks the store ataff if they gift wrap. ""It's what we live for."", was the reply. David is riding in his friend's car through a long tunnel and the passenger window doesn't work. ""It's broken."", his friend said. In the last scene of the film, David is with his friend, who has been surrounded by police and they're on a rooftop. The friend/killer yells "" I did it for you, David!"" And junps.

1kci4cx	This is a long shot!	I would say 25 to 30 years ago I watched a martial arts film on VHS that was either dubbed or subtitled with a childhood friend. There is a scene where one of the fighters stops during the fight and holds his arm out with his forearm pointed in the air and his other forearm perpendicular to the ground, and then switch his arms with his pose. It was really funny and we laugh about it all these years later; however, we cannot remember the name of the movie. The fighting scene took place indoors I believe, and the fighter was wearing a conical Asian hat (aka rice or Cooley hat). I had a chatGTP render a picture of a fighter doing the first part of the pose. Its not exact, but its certainly better than anything I could have drawn. Again, I know this is a very long shot, but if anybody knows what this movie is, you would be solving a decades long mystery and inside joke between two friends.	This is a long shot!

I was maybe 8 years old, with my older brothers and sisters, one holidays we had fun, and watched the movie from TV with commercial breaks, and I don't remember actors well, movie probably from the 2000s USA. It takes place in the summer. The main characters are a skinny young guy with a dark hair and no beard, he and a group of friends (girls and guys) go out of town, drink in a bar, then they meet another group of people, they play a game with them on the lake where they try to push each other into the water while sitting on their friends' shoulders, where one girl pulls out a tuft of hair on his head while trying to push him into the water, and laughs at it. Then they are in a country house of some adult man, this man will have a pregnant woman in the room, by the end of the film she will give some horrible birth in the hallway. Then by the end of the film this man will start killing this group of friends, but then the main character wakes up in a bar and everything that happened was not real, all his friends are alive. I'm not native eng speaker but I did everything I could. Now I'm 28 yo and never in my life did I see even blink of this movie ever again.

Both times she wants them to think she has another different designer outfit but she can't afford any so she tailors the one she has. She thinks she has them fooled but then there is talk of another event and the acquaintances all joke about how the dress is ragged and can't take any more alterations. That's when she realizes they know it's the same dress. I can't remember anything else but I think it's a 2000s romcom type thing. Help me please I'm losing my mind.

1kmsnua	Guy sitting at a computer picks up several pieces of French toast and dips them in syrup	Hey y'all - would appreciate any help. I can only remember one scene, and I don't know if I'm recalling correctly. Feel like I saw it in theater before college - so maybe 2002-2010ish. All I can remember is a basement dweller type guy, think the guy from the WoW episode of South Park, picking up several pieces of French toast and dipping them in syrup. (Don't think we see their face.) I think the setup is: Avi or robot of hot chick is asked, ""You're really a girl, right?"" Avi says yes and the scene cuts to our guy controlling the Avi helping himself to French toast - feel like I remember people laughing and saying ""ewwww"" in the theater. I cannot for the life of the me remember any other detail, and, apparently, there is some guy called French Toast which has made searching a pain in the ass. Thought it was Surrogates, but nah. Please help solve this mystery - been searching whenever inspiration strikes for over a month now.

1kbxc99	Outdoor Toilet Scene	There is a movie that I saw my parents watching in their home sometime within the last 5 or so years. It seemed like a more serious movie, maybe even a modern cowboy deal? The character in question seemed to be of questionable morality and the others were seeking his input somehow. When they approached him, he was sitting on an outdoor toilet handling business. Maybe reading a newspaper or smoking a cigarette? The other two or three people walk up and potentially say his name. When they do this he stands, reaches around his body, and gives a single wipe before addressing the other. I think he pulls his pants up at this point.

1k42krh	Trying to think of a movie I saw as a kid.	It was an action movie, probably released in the 80s or 90s the hero character had to swim into a location for the final mission or something. I think he had to rescue someone? Or storm the fortress of some bad guy. To get better at holding his breath, he would submerge himself fully in a bathtub while a cigarette was lit nearby. He was using a burning cigarette as timer. He did that a few times. I believe there was a mentor figure or some associate of his who warned him before the final arc of the movie that swimming with purpose will burn through your oxygen reserves a little faster than just sitting in a tub. I dont remember much else about the movie, just the cigarette as a timer for holding your breath mostly. Its been bothering me for days. Any ideas?	Trying to think of a movie I saw as a kid.

He also had a great Swiss Army knife that his father gave him, and there was a scene of them choosing a lobster from the market and trying to cook it. The movie also had a very ""blue-grey"" filter on it, typical for Scandinavian movies. I'm sorry that I can't give more details about the movie; I was very young.

1liq7t2	Name of a movie	So I watched a scene a while back from a movie where a male character gets taken to a normal hospital, strapped to a gurney and as he is being taken through the hospital it deteriorates and he is being taken into a mental asylum against his will. The scene itself was scary and unsettling but I'm not sure if the movie itself was or whether it was just that scene!

1k3h4jp	Please help me remember the name of this comedy movie	It was a comedy movie from the late 90s or early 2000s. There was a scene in the movie where the main characters come across a really ugly man with Puss on his face who was married to a very hot woman. And one of the characters in the movie thought that they would be able to hook up with the wife, but then when they realized that the ugly man wanted to join in, they all ran away.

1ldv87i	A movie about rebel teenage girls	I watched this movie a long time ago, maybe 2013, and it had this group of popular/rebel girls and there was a nerdy one who wanted to fit in, and the girls arranged for her to kiss a skater (?) boy for the first time. I just remember it had this scene of this girl applying butter and sprinkles as lipstick, and I think she had a younger sister.

1l3vc3m	Movie about a golden dragon woman	When I was a kid, about 10 years ago, I watched a movie on Fox/HBO/something like that (I don't exactly remember it) about a medieval kingdom that was fighting with other kingdoms or cursed. I'm not very sure about that, but I always remember that in that kingdom there was a golden dragon that turned into a golden woman to seduce the king or his son. They eventually have the deed and after that the king's army fights with that golden dragon and kills her by attacking a gem in her neck. My memory of the movie is pretty blurry since I watched it so many years ago and at the time was a kid. To me that movie was 3D animarion with pretty good CGI and a hyper realistic look, but I could be wrong and it could have been live action. If anyone can help me, I would greatly appreciate it since I am looking for that movie's name for years now.

1ljfd7g	Weird dentist movie?	I remember as a young child (I grew up in the very early 2000s if that helps) and seeing this movie on TV with an actor who I thought was Leslie Neilson but I keep looking up his movies and can't find it. It was really weird to me as a child which is why I still remember it lol but it was about this dentist guy and this girl who's like two faced I guess and she frames him for murder by creating a cast of his teeth and biting the victim she created? And he eventually finds out he's being framed and he also finds the dentures in a teddy bear? And then rips his own teeth out with pliers???? Like I said I just have flashes of memories from watching as a child but I'd really like to know what this movie was lol	Weird dentist movie?

1lg2xo8	Sci-Fi film	Putting a spoiler flair bc I am going to spoil the end of this movie in efforts to find it. This movie is a sci fi film about a guy up in space by himself. He goes crazy, at the end he calls someone (I believe his wife?) and hes told that it was all an experiment and he was never even in space in the first place, and if he opens the door to the pressure chamber he can just leave. But then it turns into this whole thing because you dont know for sure if that phone call is also part of his delusions so at this point you really dont know if he was ever in space or if he was, if he still is currently. I know the end is him ultimately deciding to leave the space craft and I remember when he does its like, everything is crashing. Things are falling from the air and after he emerges from the space craft he has to go through this like obstacle course that looks like an underground building. I know he reaches light at the end I believe that the end is left up for interpretation bc I dont remember if I personally thought he was ever in space or not At first I was almost positive it was the movie Moon but it isnt. I rewatched moon last night and although the stories are insanely similar, it isnt the movie I watched. Coming back to edit because I remember another detail, I swear, Samuel L Jackson appears at some point and tries to kill our main guy? No idea why, but I remember it happening. I went and looked at Jacksons filmography and couldnt figure it out still. And thats all I got. Does anyone know what movie this is?

1lanfup	Was there a 90s indie movie about a murderous homeless kid and the king of the hobos and magic or was I too high	I was an early cord-cutter and Netflix subscriber. I also used to be a pot head in my 20s. I spent a crazy amount of time in the late 90s and early 2000s getting higher than Sputnik and watching everything under the sun from obscure foreign films to indies to nature documentaries to The Prisoner (highly recommended) three times in a row. One particular movie stands out as every few years it pops into my head and I go searching for it and cannot find it. It wasnt particularly good, but it was so different and DIY and weird that I have always been curious to learn more about it. \- Protagonist was a homeless kid/street urchin \- There were dark urban fantasy elements \- Climax included a the King of the Hobos wizard in some kind of underground sewer lair \- Movie ends with the kid sneaking onto a rich guys yacht, brandishing a knife, as its leaving port for a trip around the world. Implication being the kid is going to murder the guy I guess??? \- There was a text font at the end claiming a role playing game based on the movie was in development. Ive tried looking for the game as well to no avail. \- Believe the movie was shot in the 90s, possibly early 2000s. The clothing style/fashion definitely had that energy. \- Very low production values \- Was very high when I watched this but at least 80% sure I did not imagine it Like I said not necessarily a great film but theres still something sad about how much art  even weird crazy art  that is getting lost as content gets either streamed or forgotten.

1lhi1tf	What movies am i thinking of???? Help!	So I have a long memory from since I was 4, and have watched many movies and shows that I can remember scenes of but not remember names of. Over the years Ive discovered majority of them, but im stuck on 2. The first is a movie my parents found for me when i was 4-5 because it was about mermaids, but when they put it on they quickly turned it off because it was NOT kid friendly. I remember an opening sequence of a wave crashing into a pool, a mermaid going in but you dont exactly see her/it, and then it pans over runes or something on the pool tiles or like an old scroll or something, but the runes were of mermaids eating sailors and people and stuff. Ive always been curious what movie that was, and want to watch it. Second is a horror movie I watched in 2013-15 on netflix around the same time the last shift and v/h/s. It was centered around halloween time with a female as the main character, blonde, cant remember the name. There were kids doing trick or treat with burlap sacks and at some point broke in and attacked the lady, it WAS NOT THE MOVIE TRICK R TREAT I thought it was too but watched it and nope. Any suggestions??	What movies am i thinking of???? Help! So I have a long memory from since I was 4, and have watched many movies and shows that I can remember scenes of but not remember names of.

1l6oii5	Religious movie that ends in a 4th wall break	I saw a film a while back that seemed to explore all of history. It had some scenes with parades (I believe filmed in mexico) that had animal carcasses. It had roman uniform wearing soldiers and a theif trying to get their food. I remember a character going up a building and talking to a higher power before being sent on a mission. The movie ends with the director (I think?) breaking the 4th wall, I think it was because it was alluding to film being the latest religion in history. It looked like it was made in the 70s but I can't remember more details to find it.	Religious movie that ends in a 4th wall break I saw a film a while back that seemed to explore all of history.

1k5dgmi	An Old Western for my Dad	My father was telling me about a movie he'd seen but couldn't remember the name of. The only thing I have to go on is a scene that made him laugh. There's a prisoner in a Western type jail and he's being forced by a deputy out sheriff to sweep the floors. At some point, there's a conversation and the prisoner tells the authority figure he knows someone that could help and offers to go get them. The authority figure agrees to let the guy go and the prisoner hands over the broom and asks if the sheriff/deputy will finish sweeping for him. Sheriff/deputy says yes and as the prisoner leaves, he starts sweeping. A few seconds later he has a ""wait, why am I sweeping"" moment and throws the broom down. That's it. That's all I've got. I'm guessing the scene was played for comedic purpose because my dad still giggles when he talks about it. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

1kk6avc	What horror movie was this?	Added NSFW since it's a rather gory movie. I remember parts of the movie, toddler brother, teenage daughter, and mother go to a family get together in a cabin. The younger children get infected with something that makes them vomit what looks like frog eggs. They start Murdering the parents in gruesome ways. Example: The uncle is found in their play tent, his intestines out on his stomach and wrapped around a toy. Then it turns out he is still alive. The teenage daughter has a tattoo of a fetus with wings on her stomach since her mom tried to abort her and it never worked. But through their differences the mother and daughter get a bond over trying to escape and survive. I was half asleep when I watched it, so I never got it's name. I don't think there were any high list celebrities. And I've tried googling the parts I remembered, but nothing came up.	What horror movie was this? Added NSFW since it's a rather gory movie.

1lfokik	Help find this movie please! =O	Me and my brother were talking about a movie we both had seen a couple years ago and neither of us could remember the name of it! So annoying! The basic plot was a soldier in a seemingly post-war world looking for his family/kid to save them but the plot twist at the end was that he actually had PTSD. Any ideas anyone??

1lfmjv0	Movie Scene where hiding soldiers get peed on	I'm looking for a movie scene I probably saw on TV. A group of soldiers or mercenaries is hiding in a river at night, possibly after their boat was destroyed or ambushed. They're still in shallow water surrounded by reeds or tall grass, trying not to be discovered. At one point, an enemy soldier urinates right on them, but they don't react, because moving would give away their position. Any idea what film this?

1kcnqz3	Early 2000's green screen effects film similar to Sin City or Sky Captain and The World of Tomorrow	In the early 2000's there was a run of films that were shot with actors on a green screen set and had the surroundings and backgrounds added digitally. The best known are probably Sin City and Sky Captain and The World of Tomorrow but I also remember Casshern (Japan), Immortel, ad vitam (France), The Spirit, 300, MirrorMask, Suckerpunch, and one other that I cannot remember the name of. What I remember about the plot is a woman looking for her brother who may be suffering mental issues or traveling between two realities. In the possible alternate reality he is an assassin or possibly some sort of hero or anti-hero that wears a mask that I remember looking like a Kodama from Princess Mononoke but just the eyes without the mouth, I think the mask was made up of bandages or a padded fabric. I think for the climactic scene he had a sniper rifle in a clock tower where he was behind a giant clock face and huge gears. I'm not sure of the country of origin, it could have been in English or subtitled.

I also vaguely remember his bedroom that had a cool old canopy bed where he was talking to a wife or girlfriend at some point. that's really all I can remember.

1le6il2	Kids spy movie	The title is hard to Google and not find Spy Kids. But when I was little me and my family would occasionally watch this movie with a main character who looked like the main character of Max Keeble, and I'm pretty sure the movie came out around the same time. The problem is, I don't think it was the same actor. Maybe just another white kid with spiky hair. The plot is him being told by this government agency that they need him to go undercover so they train him to be a spy and find out he can't talk to girls, even though the whole mission was for him to get an invite to a girl's birthday party. Spy agency adults train this kid how to talk to a girl his age, he manages to get an invite from her on his own- in that scene the female adult who's been training him suddenly walks in pretending to be the doctor and just noticing she has a birthday coming up and asking her to invite him. So she can awkwardly respond that she just did. I forget what happens at the party or how it ends, I think the birthday girl's dad turns out to be the villain or something? Thanks for any help in advance!	Kids spy movie The title is hard to Google and not find Spy Kids. But when I was little me and my family would occasionally watch this movie with a main character who looked like the main character of Max Keeble, and I'm pretty sure the movie came out around the same time. The problem is, I don't think it was the same actor. Maybe just another white kid with spiky hair. The plot is him being told by this government agency that they need him to go undercover so they train him to be a spy and find out he can't talk to girls, even though the whole mission was for him to get an invite to a girl's birthday party.

1kcfs2g	Angry cop dad	It was on TV at night during a cold month in 2005ish. Kids were bullying another kid. They had him knocked down on the ground and were spinning his own bike wheel inches away from his face. Later, his angry cop father does the same things to the bullies with his police motorcycle. I think there was also a scene where the dad isn't happy with the son dressing up for Halloween, there may have been a wolf, and I believe the dad dies or gets seriously injured and the boy is looking at the stitches on his neck at breakfast and the dad gets angry.

1kt80cv	Looking for the name of a strange movie I saw, set in 60s or 70s	One night I couldn't sleep and a movie on AMC, caught my interest. The plot was that there was a grown man, who was intellectually the age of a baby. There was a mom in the movie and an adult sister. I believe they called the man, ""baby"". Anyhow, a young social worker begins making calls to the home, who is very intrigued by ""baby"". The mom shows her away repeatedly, but relents once and let's the social worker watch him. When the mom and sister come home, they find the social worker trying to breast feed him. Someone ends up killed that night but idk which of the three adults it was. I've been trying to figure this out for years.	Looking for the name of a strange movie I saw, set in 60s or 70s One night I couldn't sleep and a movie on AMC, caught my interest.

1l4mwsi	Super weird movie I saw as a kid	I dont think it was a movie a kid should watch but my grandmother had a thing for weird movies. This one was on at one time and i dont remember very much of the plot at all but i remember a few scenes. It was live action. First, there was a cat girl who helped the main character escape from prison in some alternate dimension. She kills some mouse prison guards and says something along the lines of ""dont forget about me"" with blood dripping from her mouth and he replies ""I dont think I ever will be able to"". Secondly, I remember the main character had a body double. Not sure how it worked but while he was in the alternate dimension something else had control of his body or something like that. His body double sang ""Brick House"" by the Commodores before proposing to his girlfriend. The girlfriend mentions somethinf about the ring not being his grandmother's ring and the body double is like ""oh i threw that old thing away, you dont want that"" Lastly, I remember the body double put a spray in a bunch of children's toys and it got one one guy, who then proceeded to view his clothes as alive. He strips naked and runs across the screen at the end of the movie, urging the audience to take their clothes off too. I honestly do not remember what the movie was abiut but I do remember that the guy needed to get out of the other world and prevent his company from shipping the toys. It was a SUPER weird movie haha. Thanks in advance!	Super weird movie I saw as a kid I dont think it was a movie a kid should watch but my grandmother had a thing for weird movies.

Soon after, two female fighters rushed to attack, but the one who was restrained by a stray bullet died. The two people who rushed right after that were also shot in the chest and knocked down in an instant. That's the content.

The beginning had an old couple get into a car at night about to leave their mansion but the husband had to get out and smoke a cigarette I think it was. When he gets back inside of the car. His wife is dead or knocked out unconscious and he doesn't realized it and then gets knocked out unconscious as well by someone hiding in the back seat. Then the person rigs the car to drive off the bridge that connected to their mansion which killed and drown them. The next has like two buddies who I think are detectives driving into the castle mansion to investigate the case. I just remember them being something like a comedy duo like Abbott and Costello (originally thought it was them). They drive in the mansion and meet the daughter heiress of the couple that just died. She does the introductions and has the servants introduces themselves. One of the servants I remember was a tall butcher dude who can't speak properly because he had his tounge cut off for stealing. So whenever he talks he sounds like he is mumbling I remember that scene well because one of the detectives asked his partner if he understood what he said when the butcher introduced himself and his partner said yes and started mumble talking exactly like what the dude said. The detective duo go around trying to figure out who the killer is but we see the killer wearing a black hoodie or drape (kinda like the slasher guy from the scream horror movies) following them around. As the movie progresses. They end up finding each servant slowly being killed one by one in the mansion. I think one of the deaths had a servant choked to death by a statue hand. Eventually at the end of the movie we see the killer filling up a large bag with money that is the inheritance money the old couple had who died in the beginning of the movie. The detectives find the killer and the killer turns out to be a woman who was a lover of the the old man. She holds the detectives at gunpoint ready to get away in a car before another person in a black drape that is huge slowly appears and approaches right behind her. She turns around and sees the thing. She shoots her gun at it but it does nothing and keeps coming towards her before she finally faints from horror. The mysterious hooded figure then turns to the detectives and reveals himself to be the husband of the old couple who ""died"" in the beginning of the movie. Finally we're at the end of the movie and detectives are leaving and I think the servants were all magically alive again somehow. I think it because the butcher guy who can't talk gifts the detectives a coffin box. The detectives drive off and it turns out there was like Frankenstein in the box and it scares them showing the final scene of the car swerving side to side on the road before the movies ends.

It's sword and sorcery, possibly barbarian. There's a female warrior who has been captured and is in some dark stone room/temple. The villain there is I think also a woman. There's a large shield with a woman's profile etched on it. When they slice a sword through the etching on the shield, the warrior gets a cut on herself in the same place.

My dads trying to remember a Western he watched at the cinema as a kid and the only scene he can remember is a cowboy riding across a snow-covered hill or mountain, and then he maybe gets shot at. This was some time before 1975, and he lived in East Timor which isnt exactly cutting-edge so it might have been pretty old already. Any suggestions for what it could be would be appreciated!

1kbgxup	Old (R) movie about exchanging murder	I saw this movie a long time ago, I think before 2007. It was a movie about a woman and a man having an affair and plotting to exchange murder. The woman suggests it so the police can't trace the motive. The guy comes home and sees blood and thinks the woman killed his wife. He then kills the woman's husband (I think it was the husband), in a plane (I think....). And I think he escapes using a parachute. However, the wife shows up saying the blood was from her period. The guy eventually gets caught, and I think the wife and the woman were in it together? Even chatgpt has no idea what that movie was. Has a lot of NSFW scenes.

1l46oap	Distant childhood memories of a movie I wasnt supposed to be watching	Alright youre going to have to bear with me on this one& When I was super young, like 5 or 6, I watched a movie with my dad and sister that I DEFINITELY was not supposed to be watching. From what I remember, which isnt a lot, I gathered that it must be an R rated horror/thriller movie. We also watched it with captions on so theres a chance its a foreign film. However, I can only really recall one scene clearly and the rest is pretty hazy. I would say that in maybe the first 15-20 minutes theres a scene where the main protagonist (a middle aged father of one son &amp; seemingly skinny troubled man with light scruff/facial hair) gets bad news of some kind while at work and proceeds to get in his car and scream FUUUUCKKKK really loudly like a million times on his commute home. This is the only scene that really stuck with me as a kid. The rest of what I remember about the movie is random vibes. It was a very gray/white movie. In general, I think the father was sort of a deadbeat, perhaps failing at his job, and there were marital problems of sorts. The main plot revolved around his kid being abducted by these strange nightmarish creatures. I dont think they really talked, they just dragged people behind them with chains in this weird desert dream world (I dont know where they were even taking them though). The father ends up getting his act together enough to chase them down and rescue his son though. Thats really all I have to go off of, and I know its not much, but Id love to watch this movie as an adult with more awareness and memory capacity. If someone by any chance has any ideas of what this could be, Id lose my shit. Good luck!

1leb2rb	What cgi animated movie had a bee and grasshopper fall in love? It was a kids movie, and may have been a remake or at least inspired by Mr. Bug Goes to Town.	EDIT: This was the movie: Tall Tales from the Magical Garden of Antoon Krings (Drôles de petites bêtes, 2017) I very randomly was reminded of a movie I had found it on amazon a while back, and now Im searching for an answer, because I cant find proof it exists anymore. Heres what I remember: Edit: It is definitely not any of the Maya the Bee films. I think that the story may have described itself as being based off of a fable? \- I think the movie poster had a bee and grasshopper sitting on a flower or something similar at night time and the cgi for the movie was pretty decent. Definitely a step above from some really low effort kids movies. \- From what I can recall from the plot, there were around three main characters, who were: a kind queen bee, a little girl bee, and a grasshopper. They lived in a small hive town in the grass, there was probably a villain, and I think the grasshopper was poor and maybe played a fiddle. At the very end of the story, the little girl bee takes the queens place, and the former queen lives happily ever after with the grasshopper. Thanks for any help on this.

1kfdwji	I think it was a horror or mystery type movie	We follow our main protagonist who is a teenage boy and I think hes visiting his dad for the summer. He noticed that his neighbor son goes missing and nobody seems to remember that the son ever existed. He makes friends with this girl who is also a teenager, but I think that happens later on in the movie. He discovered that there is some creature who is stealing kids and removing everybodys memory of them, and the big twist in the end is that he also had a little brother who came with him to visit his dad who he forgot about. In the end, he gets his brother back and all three of them are driving back home. But thats when he realizes the flower the girl gave him is not real, and they had discovered that the creature that was stealing kids killed all the real flowers and vegetation around it. Then we cut to the same girl, in a boat with a bunch of kids as the teenage boy realize that she was the monster all along. I think it was made relatively recently, like probably within the past 10 to 15 years. I dont remember anything else about it besides that, any other clues would be very helpful, thanks!

She has to go on an adventure to stop the evil man from taking over this place. I distinctly remember something to do with a big black ball (almost like the dog bomb things from Mario just real) rolling down a hill to stop the girl from getting to the bad guy, but I genuinely dont have much recollection of a anything else to do with the movie:(	HELP!

One person, I think a child, asks their mother whats for dinner or what shes cooking. She responds pasta primavera while shes chopping vegetables.

1l8cylb	Move from another universe?	I remember this one, but I also remember another film very similar to the premise Birth starring Nicole Kidman. It was a woman who lost her husband, but her brother-in-law, which was her dead husband's brother, claimed that he's actually her husband' spirit. The wife initially did not believe that her husband was actually in his brother's body. She thought her brother-in-law was a liar, but eventually, with all the things that he knew, she figured it must be her husband coming back to life; but she realized that her brother-in-law actually just read the letters that was written to her. He studied everything down to a T and was able to Regurgitate the information as if he was him. The movie came out around 2005 to 2008. I cannot remember the actors names nor can I remember the movie title. Every time I try to look for the movie based on how I describe it, it keeps coming up with this film or other similar, but never the exact one. I feel like i watched it in an alternate universe. Please tell me somebody remembers it!	Move from another universe? I remember this one, but I also remember another film very similar to the premise Birth starring Nicole Kidman.

Here goes: I think this was shown in a **Canadian theatre** sometime from about **1975 to 1983** (*possibly* a **made for TV movie** though I don't think so). It was a **low-budget action movie** (lower budget than The Keep or Time Bandits). It had **medieval fantasy** elements (I think European but it could have been Asian, like a Shaw Brothers movie). The tone was **serious** IIRC. There was a powerful **evil character**, *possibly* with special powers. The movie featured a good man or woman who **summoned several different good allies**. These allies seemed distinct to me (e.g., a swordsman, a strongman...). Several or most of these allies died tragically (this was the most upsetting part to me as a child).

1l5cwol	Movie about a woman interviewing an unseen presence in an abandoned building.	I only saw the beginning: a young woman (caucasian, blonde or maybe dirty-blonde hair) walks across what looks like an outdoor industrial area or maybe old abandoned train track leading to warehouses or an old factory, something like that. She enters the abandoned building/factory/whatever and maybe sets down her purse and cell phone (or maybe not). It is daytime. She starts talking to the air like she already knows something is there (I don't recall seeing any other people in the beginning of this movie). Something answers after several querries and it feels like she is coming back to continue a conversation they had recently -- she knew it was there already and has a set of questions ready to ask it. If memory serves, she asks questions about its nature, and sometimes it gives concise answers and sometimes it just doesn't respond. I remember getting the impression it was very, very old and possibly no human or was something pre-human and that it was bound to that spot (I got the impression it was the spot of earth the building was on, not the building itself). That's as far as a got as I had other tasks to complete. This just happened to be the next thing to come while I was using the TV as background noise back like 5-10 years ago -- I got sucked into the beginning but had tasks to complete so I made a mental note that I needed to check this out later. I was intesely curious to know the backstory of this entity/presence and why she knew it was there, and what the rest of her questions were and its answers. Cut to: 5-10 years and a few days ago I saw a reference to this film on some show (again, background noise, I don't remember the show) and this memory flooded back: I had to watch the whole of this film. It started making me restless -- last few days are using refining AI querries to narrow it down and I get no hits even close (though I did discover many new headscratcher films i never knew about, which was good), so I've exhausted the AIs I have access to. I cannot rest until I watch this film. I'm at my wit's end.

The woman forms a close bond to her husbands brother, and the relationship has a lot of sexual tension, maybe they do form a romantic relationship. Cant recall.

1l7e6kp	A movie similar to naturally blonde	I saw a movie a few years ago where I think a blonde girl has to go to the military. There she teams up with other girls and at the last training mission her group is unexpectedly the only one that succeeds. Do you know the name? I only remember that it reminded of naturally blonde when I saw it but I forgot to write down the name.

1lijiyx	A cliche filled romcom from the 00s where the guy and girl meet while inside a video store at night when it's closed, hiding. He owns a shop(?), she's ""kooky"" and swims in other people's pools.	It seems like one of the stars was quite well-known. And I keep thinking the females was of Asian heritage but maybe not. Guy was white tho. I watched this free on a steaming service 1 or 2 summers ago. Idk why but it popped up into my mind today and it's driving me mad that I can't remember who was in it.

1lgxmks	What horror movie?	It must been early 2000's. I think it takes place in a national park or a small community surrounded by forest. You follow a cop or a park ranger when a naked person comes out of nowhere covered in red (blood?). The person is non-responsive and just walks and stares. If I remember correctly I they reach you, die or something like that. I think most of the movie takes place during daytime. By the end of the movie it turns out that red people have ben popping up in other places in the country. A vague description, I know. It was a long time ago. Does anyone know what I'm talking about?

1lf3mka	Pretty messed-up war-ish movie	I caught this movie on TV one insomniac night a couple of decades ago, probably, and it messed with my head. Shocking stuff. Theres a young man who, I think, is drafted and, at one point, attempts suicide by slashing his wrists and forearms. Hes saved my a medical staff. The look of wild ecstasy on his face as he cut himself is one thing that was really messed up. I think the actor may have had red hair and I think part of the story was that his parents turned him in for going AWOL but its been a really lingering time. This flick was dark, to say the least. Dark, raw, and bleak. I thought it was titled The Front or The Line but thats fuzzy, too. Sorry for so much inexactitude. Every Google search imaginable hasnt worked.

1li7avs	60's/70s musical comedy, Arabian themed, TV or movie...Bob Denver?	The part I saw: Everyone was dressed Arabian style, and I think the set was in a big tent. Bob Denver (I think) was trying to romance this beautiful woman. He offered her a seat on a zebra skin couch. She said, ""I could never sit on a dead animal."" and he said ""Would you prefer a live one?"" Eventually this big guy with a beard who was a sheik or something arrived to invite the woman to his palace, and he sang a song about all the wonderful things she would experience there, and Bob Denver kept interrupting singing ""What about me, me, me? What about me, me, me?"" I've pretty much given up on ever identifying this, but thought I'd take another stab at it. I saw just a bit of it on TV when I was a kid, probably in the 70s. It caught my attention because (I believe) Bob Denver was in it, and we always loved seeing the Gilligan's Island cast in other things. But I see nothing in his IMDB that sounds like what I saw, so it may have been part of a TV series, or a fantasy or dream sequence from something. (Definitely NOT Gilligan's Island, I grew up with that, have the DVDs, all pretty much memorized.) Or, somehow, my brain short-circuited over the years and it was someone else. But I feel so certain it was him. Not 100% sure if it was in color, but I think it was.	60's/70s musical comedy, Arabian themed, TV or movie...Bob Denver?

1kbxuhs	Some movie about a door to an alternate reality?	I remember seeing a few clips of it and saying I would watch it later but I didnt write down the name and I forgot. It was about a group of friends, dont remember how many but there were at least two girls. They do these kinds of urban explorations and wander on to a house that has a door in the middle of it. It is some sort of portal to another dimension and then weird things happened and there were a bunch of other doors to very surreal realities? like one in which there were giants and so on and I think they were chasing/fleeing frome someone through those doors. As far as I remember, production was very cheap-looking and acting was a bit weird. I dont really have hopes for finding it but any help will be appreciated!

1l5alb8	Animated sci-fi hip-hop epic	Growing up in the early 2000's I remember watching this animated (or anime maybe?) movie several times. I believe it was a sci-fi hip-hop space opera featuring alot of record scratching and lewd (for lack of a better word) body movement. I distinctly remember one scene where someone was using record scratches to mind control women into shaking their butts around. I know this sounds like a fever dream and honestly it might've been. I asked my family about it several times but no one seems to know what I'm talking about. It was either made back in the 80's or 90's and I believe the word ""twisters"" was somewhere in the title. This movie helped shape my music tastes so any help would be appreciated.

1ld5z2q	Witchy circle dancing scene	Please someone help me find what movie Im thinking of. For context I was born in 1997 and would have watched this before I was 13, Im thinking I was about 9-10 so its not any movie after 2010. What I can remember is a group of young women, witches maybe but they might have just been doing a spell, in a big circle with a bonfire in the middle, throwing chicken legs and maybe other animal parts in a cauldron in the middle and they start out in all white dresses and eventually are chanting and dancing around the circle nude, there might be blood on them but Im not sure. Ive looked at so many movies and googled until my eyes hurt but I just cannnnnot find it. Most of what comes up is movies that are broadcasted as witchcraft movies so Im thinking it might be one thats not? I dont know! Anything helps!

1lfz1bc	Non-English language film where a guy wakes up to find he can't walk.	I was flipping channels as a kid and I saw this single, very disturbing scene from a foreign -language film (possibly Spanish) where a man wakes up in a bed (either in a hospital room or a prison cell) and slowly realises his legs don't work. He starts screaming and shouting and eventually falls out of bed and drags himself to the room's door, which is locked. The scene ended with him sobbing and screaming on the floor. I have never forgotten this scene (obviously!). It would have been on British TV in the very early eighties, in the evening.	Non-English language film where a guy wakes up to find he can't walk.

1lk7fo1	Late 90s (possible 80's) action movie with two men/""monks"" who could move things with their mind and control people.	I am trying to remember a movie that I watched back in the early 2000s on TV, in it it had two ""monks"", (not sure if they were actually called monks) in the movie but they did train in a monastery/school to allow them to control things and potentially people with their minds. The part that I remember the most is at the end, one of the monks controls a knife (at least I think it was) with his mind and uses it to stab the other guy in the forehead with it. The last scene is the guy who was stabbed waking up in the hospital where the nurse or doctor tells him they had to remove part of his brain, but its ok no one uses that part, only for the guy to realise he can no longer use his power.

1ldtu6c	Fantasy movie (80s or 90s)	I've been trying to remember the title of this movie. I watched it's trailer many years ago so I don't have much to go on. What I can recall is the main character sort of slept for many years then woke up in the future. Mc is a white blonde male with shoulder length hair. The villain is looking for an item, he actually says in while torturing some guys 'The Item, where is it?'. There was a scene where the villain used a cross bow on a girl, I think the girl shielded the Mc. There's also a girl, she punched the Mc the first time they met. I think she's the one that woke the Mc up. The also seem to fall in love. I think it was a sequel or so, I also think the title has 'Dragon' in it but I could be wrong.

The show was superrr good, but i had to put a pause on it since I had to go to school nd stuff wtv, wtv. Anyways, the show was about this teenage boy whos dad was barely in his life because he was an astronaut, but his son never hated him for it or anything like that I think. The boy had a childhood friend, a mom, and a school where he would get bullied because his dad was a famous astronaut while he was, pretty much, a loser. Then he meets this girl who he lwk likes but she has a secret of her own. soon he finds out that his dad wasnt a normal astronaut but was either an alien or worked with aliens (i cant remember). so an organization, who worked with his father, hunted this boy down since the father died and tried to get info about his father off him and stuff. They realized he knew nothing and left which, unsurprisingly, spiked the boys interest in his father. DOES ANYONE KNOW THIS SHOW?!?? PLSS I BEGG	HELP ME!!

1lhwuyx	I CANT FIND THIS ANIMATED MOVIE FROM MY CHILDHOOD	I was born in 2008 so this movie should be between that and 2018. (my childhood) What i remember: Animation style was like in ''UP!'' There was an evil queen that chased someone or a group of people. There was a scene where in a thunderstorm she appeared in the light of lightning rays and i remember that scared the shit out of me. The people running where in a dessert at one point maybe. There was a joke where they where running in a field and there was a random gate with no fence. they ran through it and the last one closed the gate. The chaser/queen had a castle in/on a cliff.

If anyone could help me i would sincerely appreciate it because this is driving me crazy hahaha.	I CANT FIND THIS ANIMATED MOVIE FROM MY CHILDHOOD I was born in 2008 so this movie should be between that and 2018. (my childhood) What i remember: Animation style was like in ''UP!'' There was an evil queen that chased someone or a group of people. There was a scene where in a thunderstorm she appeared in the light of lightning rays and i remember that scared the shit out of me. The people running where in a dessert at one point maybe. There was a joke where they where running in a field and there was a random gate with no fence. they ran through it and the last one closed the gate. The chaser/queen had a castle in/on a cliff.

1lhqxbb	Funny kind of horror-ish movie?	I was thinking of another movie I only saw once.. Sorry for the long text but anyhow all I recall are: couple (or a family that soon got split I don't recall) end up at the mansion of a slight weird looking male, sit around a very large dining table at one point, then the couple were in a long hallway that soon had one end wall start to move onto them, after finding a small stuffed hallway closet they then finally found one not-locked door that opened in time for the couple to head into a small stairway just as the door then got crushed by the moving wall, upstairs through a trapdoor was an attic - and while the couple looked around a safe box quietly rolled itself onto the trapdoor causing the two to be stuck up there, they went to sleep on a bed whereas a nearby painting soon was seen having remote eyes where the weird male spotted them sleeping on the bed, the bed mattress did a 'barrel roll' or two which really woke up the couple only for them to then soon notice a small side trapdoor magically open up, turned out to be a slide 'built inside the walls', at a Y fork she went one way while he went other way, he ended up in a deadend that was located outside the weird male's bedroom, while she ended up getting ejected right outside the mansion itself close to where their car was located at only to find two (or few?) strange not-so-human characters a bit ""interested in her"".

1kp591o	Beach movie from the 1980s	I remember seeing a beach-themed movie in the 1980s with a woman who was romantically involved with both a boy and another girl. There was a scene that's been stuck in my head where she is standing between them, struggling with who to choose. It's an outdoor scene. I thought it might be Summer Lovers, but it's not. I've watched what seems like every terrible 1980s beach movie and still haven't found it. Does this sound familiar to any of you?

1l6583c	Film where adults begin to behave childishly due to contamination in the water.	I''m trying to find a movie I watched sometime between 2010 and 2015. It's a live-action film, definitely not horror, but more of a sci-fi or fantasy with suspense. The main character is a girl, around 10 years old, who leads a group of friends. They ride their bikes a lot, and one of the boys in the group has a stutter. The central plot involves the adults in their town starting to act like children due to water contamination. It gets pretty chaotic, and I specifically remember the local hospital transforming into something like a nursery to handle all the regressed adults. I remember watching it on Netflix at some point, but it's probably been removed by now. I think it might be an independent or not-very-well-known film. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

1lfbzy8	Journey to? Trip to?	This is a ridiculous long shot. So, Ive never seen this movie. It was recommended to me by a waiter a while ago. I want to say it was heavily focused on an older mother and a son. I want to say it was something along the lines of journey/trip in the title, and it was a town name, I believe in Texas. Im hoping this is enough to nail it down. Ill 100% know it when I see it. Thank you so much, Reddit! Edit: I believe it is set pre-2000s, and possibly came out before the 2000s as well.	Journey to?

1khveo3	Trailer where woman threatens robber	So, my wife and I were on YouTube and in the last year we saw a trailer for a film where this dude goes into a gas station/convenience store to rob it. He's armed with a weapon, I think it was a knife. I'm pretty sure she was just a patron who steps in to interrupt it. He asks her if she wants to die and threatens her with the weapon. She looks at him with zero emotion and says ""maybe..."" I've tried various AI, searched everywhere, can't find it. We only saw this trailer or ad one time. Terrible marketing job for something that looked awesome. Any ideas?

1lagom7	Old movie featuring a hard-bitten, bullying type of femme fatale	Edit: Its *Detour* (1945). It would have been released in the 1940s-1950s, probably. I dont think the main characters was a tough-detective type like in a lot of noir movies: he really got pushed around by this woman. A lot of femmes fatales are depicted as having an elegant, victimized persona and use that to their advantage, but this one was a total bully, coarse-talking I think, and wanted to look tough. To be honest Ive never seen the movie so I dont have any other details; I just remember a description I read of this womanI think she was lower-class economically, blond maybe, and described as really gritty and tough-talking. Thanks for any suggestions!	Old movie featuring a hard-bitten, bullying type of femme fatale Edit: Its *Detour* (1945). It would have been released in the 1940s-1950s, probably.

1lb75o3	(Trigger Warning) Movie about a girl who commits suicide but regrets it halfway through	There's this scene, where a girl decides to kill herself. She goes into a barn (or something of that sort) to hang herself. But as she does it, she regrets it and wants to stop, but it's too late. I feel like most of the movie is about her wishing she could have not done it, but I really don't remember. Anyone have a clue? At least I think it's a girl. Could be a guy tbh.

1l9ak1v	1990's film about native american magic?	I'm having memories of a film I watched as a child but can't remember the name of. There are 2 parts I remember; 1) The beginning of the film starts with a story about a native american man playing a magic drum. He disappears, and a raven or crow comes in and starts pecking at the drum, destroying it. A wolf then enters and stops the raven. 2) Later on in the same film, a kid is fighting against some sort of shape-shifting evil, and uses the drum and \[I think\] a necklace to ward it off? Additional Note: For some reason, I also have some memories of a glass harmonica in the film, but not a typical glass harmonica, more like multiple glasses filled with water to create the sound. I worry that I'm misremembering, or confusing the glass harmonica part with a different film like Shapeshifter.	1990's film about native american magic?

1ki57o9	Weird floating entities and crossing storylines	Hi folks, I'm struggling to find the name of a film I saw years ago. From memory there were approximately 5 different storylines which all seem to crossover, as in, one story ends and another begins and they seem to go round in a circle. In each story there's these weird winged entities which float around. One story has someone driving a friend to a hospital, only to find it's abandoned and he came get out. Another story has a couple of people in a car travelling through a desert landscape, and another story has a girl trying to escape from a house. I think I remember seeing a pentagram in a poster for it. It's driving me nuts, any help would be appreciated.

Scene - High energy, music and motorcycles doing stunt jumps over a swimming pool and probably a few ladies in bikinis being impressed... It's probably going to be late 80s or early 90s. It may well be an episode of Baywatch for all I know. But any help or suggestions appreciated.	I only recall seeing a single scene of this movie as a child and I was fixated by it.

I dont remember very much about this movie except for the ending. It was about a woman who lives on a farm who harbors Jews in her house during WW2. It ends with American soldiers entering her home and they get angry with her I believe because of how well they perceive her to be living during wartime. But when they search the house the find the people she protected in her attic.

I forgot how it got to this point but they agreed to duel each other or something like that, and the douche couldn't stand in the slippery mud, so instead of fighting him the good knight/possible peasant guy just kinda stabbed his sword in the ground and let the other peasant kill the guy while he was slipping in the mud.

1lh4pdy	80s/90s movie about guy who has a hidden past and is living a normal life until his past comes back to him and hes tied up and whipped by a blonde woman then escapes on the run via an expensive car if Im remembering right.	The movie has plenty of scenes where the main character who I believe looked a lot like Patrick Swayze/the guy who played 2 face in the dark night exchanges numerous phone calls from an old friend who brought the violence to his door via a phone box. The bdsm scene with the whip I think is also foreshadowed in the movie cover as a womans silhouette holding a whip.	80s/90s movie about guy who has a hidden past and is living a normal life until his past comes back to him and hes tied up and whipped by a blonde woman then escapes on the run via an expensive car if Im remembering right.

1l68167	Kind of obscure horror movie set on Halloween with rag-doll/scarecrow children antagonists	I barely remember seeing this movie years ago, the design of the creatures is what stuck to me. I believe it started with a woman on Halloween night who was giving out treats, then one time she opened the door to a pair of kids with huge round masks/heads sort of resembling scarecrows/ rag dolls. I think there was one with a carved pumpkin head. They had stitched outfits that looked homemade from a farm/ had a hillbilly vibe. They had kid like proportions but they were oddly scaled up to almost adult height. She gave them candy and closed the door on them. Then (my memory gets blurry) she hears a knock/doorbell and opens the door to the same kids, she tells them off but they just stand there saying nothing. She opens the door to them again and starts getting frustrated. Then laughing is heard and supernatural stuff starts happening to her house. The movie switches to be foggy throughout with a yellow/orange haze and her neighbourhood is now a ghost town. Then more of the scarecrow kids start appearing with varying appearances and start tormenting her. I specifically remember a scene with a creature with a Raggedy Ann vibe (red threaded pigtails, dress, potato sack textured skin, round blush with a wide smile) just swinging. The designs are slightly reminiscent of Sam from Trick r Treat. I know its a bit vague but any help would be appreciated!

He hides it at home and it hatches into a creature that looks a bit like a dinosaur or dragon but i dont really remember. At some point he sneaks it into school but it keeps growing very quickly and eventually it escapes into a river. this is all i really remember and some of the details might be a bit inaccurate but its been driving me insane!! whenever i google it it always comes up with water horse but thats definitely not it.	looking for old movie I watched this movie a good few years ago on a random tv channel that only shows old movies, im pretty sure it was in black and white but i could be wrong.

1kqi85q	Low Budget Film Set in One building with a Killer	Desperately trying to remember this film because it's been on my mind since I watched it a few years back. It was on Netflix, but I am unsure if it was an original. Regardless it was very low budget and kinda hard to follow. It might have been sci-fi, or at least had science fiction elements. And it came off as being unfinished. I remember it all being done in one building, and the building was painted white. I do not remember it being very heavily decorated. There is a group of people in the building being hunted by a guy who I think was in some sort of all black suit. Near the end is a scene that very much stuck with me where there is an explosion, I think in an elevator shaft, that was very visibly edited in in a way that was jarring even in the context of the rest of the film. Maybe because there wasn't many other visual effects like that? The end of the movie had two people left, I think a woman and a black man, but I might be confusing the antagonist in some way with the man. It is revealed that there is some sort of timeloop happening, or maybe they knew already and finally reached the machine that causes it? And I am mostly sure that for some reason only one of them make it through. They find the suit and weapons the antagonist used, revealing it was actually them from a previous loop. I cannot remember why but they take up the mantle and continue the cycle. I think someone is revealed to be the son of the woman who was sent back? but that detail might be entirely wrong so take it with a grain of salt. It is very hard for me to determine what parts of my confusion are from forgetting and what parts are simply from the film being confusing, as I distinctly remember both myself and my father, who I watched it with, being absolutely dumbfounded by it. If I can remember anything else I will update.

1k86so3	Whats this Movie (Japanese or Chinese film)	I watched this movie a while back so Ill do my best to explain it. This movie starts with two best friends who I believe live together. Ill give them names so it wont be confusing. One of them is getting married (Cindy) and one of them is a quiet &amp; masculine girl (Sam). So Cindy is super excited about getting married because she feels like itll be her next step in life and whatever so this is a big deal, but I guess the man she was supposed to be marrying called off the wedding and cut contact. So Cindy is super upset and goes into a kind of depressive state while Sam listens to her and basically is trying to support her. One day Sam and Cindy go out and meet this guy (Ill call him Tyler) and Cindy is immediately interested in him. Sam is kind of just like yeah okay hes just some guy so shes not really having any opinions on this guy and Cindy is basically throwing herself all over him. (Just for context Sam likes Cindy) Anyway Cindy and Tyler kinda start hanging out after that and Sam would tag along for Cindy and all three of them started getting closer. As they got closer Sam and Tyler built a separate connection and end up going to this lighthouse and slept with each other. So now its a love triangle because Sam likes Cindy and Tyler while Cindy likes Tyler. Anyway fast forward they keep this whole fling a secret from Cindy, but later on she finds out and theres a moment of betrayal and they stop speaking. Cindy is upset at Sam and Tyler is kinda out of the picture for the time being. (Cant remember what happened in between that) So after this whole thing Sam and Cindy make up and plan to move away together as besties, they start packing their things and getting everything ready until the day they were supposed to leave Sam found Cindy in a bath of her own blood. (Cindy committed suicide) Of course Sam is in shambles and then move on again we find out that Sam was pregnant with Tylers baby and so its fast forwards to Tyler and Sam getting married and being together and they name the baby after Cindy.

1kgpufm	Horse movie help	It wouldve come out between 1990-2009. I dont remember much of the plot other than it having something to do with a dark colored horse and a preteen girl. Not very specific sorry lol However there is a very specific scene where a lady (not the main character, I think it was her mother?) with black curly hair is stood over a stove with a pot of boiling water. The shelf then collapses sending spice bottles into the water which splashes into her eyes blinding her. She screams and then theres a cut scene (possibly an ambulance scene) but next thing I remember is her sitting in a hospital bed and face wrapped like a mummy from all the bandages. She does make a recovery but has some permanent damage.	Horse movie help It wouldve come out between 1990-2009.

1lhf5f5	Question about a movie name	When I was a younger I watched a movie at a friends house. It was about this lady who was staying at a house and cleaning it or something? However, the main reason she was being warned about the house was the murders that occurred in the house. I remember there being a teenage daughter killed by I think the dad above their garage, the mom drowning the baby in the tub, and the mom killing herself with a gun. Basically the entire family died in one night. The overall premise was that they repeated this every night. I know its not very specific what I remember, but it bothered me that I havent figured it out after all these years what movie it was. If anyone has any suggestions of what it could be, I would appreciate!!	Question about a movie name When I was a younger I watched a movie at a friends house.

1liglxd	need help remembering a short horror film	Hey everyone, About 3 weeks ago I watched a ~2minute horror short (on Twitter/TikTok). Heres what happened: 1. A cop pulls over a woman for speeding. He makes her do the flashlight test and notices one of her eyes is totally off. 2. He asks, Do you have a lazy eye? 3. Another cop runs her ID and comes back saying shes dead. 4. The woman starts floating, rips the cop off the ground, and hurls him. 5. At the end, a cop says, I think Im in love with her, then runs into the woods. It had a gritty, realistic police cam feel. Anyone recognize this? Thanks =O	need help remembering a short horror film Hey everyone, About 3 weeks ago I watched a ~2minute horror short (on Twitter/TikTok). Heres what happened: 1.

1lgjqt0	Film from when I was a kid	Hello! Im looking for a liveaction or mixedmedia film (possible lowbudget indie / festival) from around the 2000s or later. The main character has a superpower that lets them magically fuse everyday objects into tools or vehicles. Two vivid scenes: 1. They use duct tape and candy (gummy-like) to assemble a working pistol or riflegum acts like living material that powers the weapon. 2. They take a large tractor-tire, a chair, a steering wheel, fuse them with something like a watch or belt via their power, creating a drivable vehicle. Also the plot seemed to involve them escaping from prison or a holding facilitymaybe they are an alien or evil character. Its definitely not anime, more a weird indie sci-fi/fantasy.

1ko7f3k	its been so long since i have seen this movie	Hello Everyone, Theres is a movie I have been looking for for years and I cant seem to find anything about it. It is an asian film (Chinese, Japanese, or Korean i don't really remember) and I believe the movie starts with a robot being built which is then later partnered up with a police officer. From what I remember there was some humor and a love story where there was a girl who fell in love with the robot but I can't really remember the plot of this movie. All I mostly remember were the fights where the main character would transform into a robot (very cool transformations) and would fight other robots. At the end of the movie all I could remember was the main character being defeated and a large group of people from a organization ready to capture him? If there are any movies similar to this I would really appreciate some titles in the responses. Sorry if this didn't really make sense either= Thanks.	its been so long since i have seen this movie Hello Everyone, Theres is a movie I have been looking for for years and I cant seem to find anything about it.

Basically they both get handcuffed somehow (i forgot) and are forced to move around together lost in a forest Their both not nice with each other i think and stubborn , Theirs also a scene where Mc pulls to a tree and the girl angrily asks why and he says he has to relief himself. They both i think make a cabin and live their and slowly become nice and fall in love they also make a bathtub in the cabin i think. I forgot alot of the movie cause I saw it when I was young maybe in 2015 but not sure.

1kjdt03	Classic piratemovie?	I saw this movie over 20 years ago on German television in German (probably dubbed). The look and feel of it was Hollywood of the 50s. The only scene I remember clearly is that a bunch of people are dragging ship cannons over land to make a surprise attack on a fort or fortified city from inland and not from the sea. The leader of this group has Kirk Douglas vibes, but should not be him (I looked through his filmography). I think the fort they are attacking belongs to the Spanish and I do not think the movie is set in the Carabbian.	Classic piratemovie?

1ku3lut	Samurai movie with a crazy credits gag	My friend was recently telling me about a movie that hes been trying to find the name of for years. All he remembers was that there was a scene where theres a samurai fight in a bamboo forest. One samurai dies and the credits begin to roll. But then a hand grabs the credits and the samurai dies, uses the credits to climb back up to his feet. He says he saw the movie in 2014, but the movie looks like it couldve come out in the early 2000s. He also saw it on TV and was living in Italy at the time.

1l2qss5	Mid/late 90s witch/demon movie	I don't remember much about the movie itself other than it was some type of witch/demon movie and the opening of the movie. It opens in a construction site and zooms up to an undercovered cave/tomb. The cave/tomb seems to have been sealed with some type of protective writing. I wish I could remember more of it. Pretty sure it was a b-movie and didn't have a big theatrical release.

1km57s9	Late 90s early 2000s movie possible straight to video tv series?	Dont remember much and this going to be a long shot. Saw it at someones house dont remember who. Asked all my friends at the time and was not any of them. At the time I drank and smoked A LOT and would end up at random peoples house occasionally. It was on their tv but not sure if it was dvd/vhs, cable or what. It was between 2001-2003. I worked at a first run movie theatre from 01-06. It was not a new release in theaters at that time. It had the faculty and disturbing behavior vibes and looks filmography wise. No known actors/actresses then or since I saw it. So here goes. \- teens possible college kids I remember being in a secluded area like they were hiding. Maybe like around 7-8 of them but some are not regular humans. \-I only remember one scene of them being outside and I dont remember seeing any other buildings, houses, etc in the background. Not sure if some of them are aliens or its a virus or what than can give them abilitie/powers. The one scene I remember outside is where 1 guy says to 1 main guy that someone didnt take. Someway the normal teens can become one of the aliens/others. Idk if they all have the same powers/abilities. That scene outside was like a metal storage building if I remember correctly. But one of the scenes I remember inside might have been like a warehouse? \- one Of the main characters that I believe is leader of the aliens/others"" is with one of the main regular teens are drinking a liquor bottle and I believe doing coke. The alien/other is drinking the liquor like its water. Theyre talking about something like theyre having a moment. this main regular teen is the topic of the next scene I remember. He either has a girlfriend or a girl he likes there with the rest of the group. She is a normal teen as well I believe. \- the regular teen mentioned previously is having sex on what I remember to be on top of boxes on a pallet? Which is why I think its like a warehouse? But he is having sex with his girlfriend or the girl he likes mentioned previously then the main alien/other he was getting drunk with and doing coke with walks around the corner with his girlfriend/ the girl he likes that he is having sex with now!!! Theres 2 of them. He looks back down and his girlfriend hes having sex with transforms/morphs/shapeshifts back into her original form which is one of the teens in the movies and again idk if theyre aliens or what so idk if thats even original form. The girl he was having sex with is one of the aliens/others. This girl is not white. She has darker tone like light brown/latina but from what I can remember is asian with long black hair but no accent? She starts laughing at him like her and the leader/main alien/other set him up. Not sure but she is the only one not white. The girlfriend that is the real one that walked around the corner with leader/alien/other looks disappointed and walks away. I was between 18-20 when I randomly came to at some random strangers house on tv (dvd/vhs/cable/straight to home video/series and made an impression on me ever since. I do not believe this is mainstream cuz Ive seen a lot of shit and no one Ive talked to the day after I saw it till now including people, internet, and ai have ever heard of it. Im 42 now and I think about this several times a year ever since and its an itch I can never scratch. PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD SOMEBODY HELP ME!!!!!!!

I know it was filmed in Canada because the beautiful scenery and mountains made me google it. And I remember he flew in altowards the end on some glide or parachute type thing. The ""realize he wants the girl"" moment (I think). Ask any questions I can dig deep for other details I may recall. I recall liking it and I'm just genuinely curious what it was.	dig deep Hi all!

Meanwhile several other things are going on, including some mice holding a seance which accidentally summons a ghost that chases them around, and it all descends into comedic chaos.

1k732mx	Movie about a babysitter getting kidnapped	Okay so i watched this movie when I was younger, so I guess its from the early 2000s-2010s, and from what I remember its a horror/action movie. All I remember about it is that it was about a pretty teen going to babysit 2 boys. And i remember the two boys being pretty old, like teens, too old to be needing a babysitter. One of the two brothers had issues, and throughout the movie we can see that he kind of « falls in love » with the babysitter, but in a very creepy and obsessive way. And its not the first time hes done that, since it appears he had done it with multiple other babysitters before. Eventually, the « normal » brother and the babysitter have to lock themselves in the bathroom because the crazy brother is becoming dangerous. But in the end, they all survive, the parents eventually finally come back home, and the babysitter is relieved. However, i remember it having a bad ending, with the parents locking the babysitter up in the bathroom because she knows too much or something, and her making SOS signals in Morse with the bathrooms lights. Also, if i remember correctly they werent just 2 boys, there was also a little girl with them, but Im not completely sure. Thank you!!! Edit : I finally solved it!!

I think it might be a flute or a clarinet or something. He ends up being this guy that bullied her in school and he gives her this good day to make up for tormenting her. I think they fall in love and I think there ends up being a bar fight. Does anyone know what I'm talking about? I'm starting to think it was a fever dream.

1l8j28q	Looking for a sad movie.	So I watched this rather old movie maybe 10+ years ago with my cousin as it was airing on TV. The TLDR is that this was either a French or Belgian (French) movie that was centred around a girl in her teens who lived with her single father. Later on the movie it is revealed that her mother works as either a stripper or a prostitute but I cannot remember exactly. Some other distinct details I remember is that in the movie she talks about doing homework with her friend Nicholas but eventually ends up falling in her mother's footsteps. The movie ends with her sleeping with her mother's best friend. The movie I saw originally was in a Polish dub and I believe the title would have translated to ""Depression"" but Polish TV has a tendency of muddying up the waters. Anyhow I've been dying to re-watch this movie so any help identifying it would be appreciated. :)	Looking for a sad movie.

In it was an image of a woman (maybe resembles the lady from The Grudge). Everytime the person looks away (or flips the page?) The woman appears closer. This repeats several times until the woman disappears from the book and appears right in front of them and kills them. It was made by a group called Coffin TV or something similar. There was another one where a girl was in her room getting dressed or something? And it could be seen on her mirror that there was someone in the background wearing a wolf mask or something while dancing but the girl never seems to notice them. When they eventually do notice them, she gets killed. Also made by the same group I think?

Who is grieving and is drugged by this woman. This other guy gets put out into the desert to die. But then he finds this cave with these weird looking men. In the cave, theres this golden pool of some kind. This guy walks into the pool. And when he comes out hes like some kind of God with all this gold jewellery on him. And when he returns, he rules this whole empire. I cant really remember much after this as I didnt watch the whole movie.	Egyptian Pharaoh?

The guide says if you shot the bird in the head they will both fall but if you shot it in the heart the bird will let go of the boy.

1ku2df1	It's not return to Oz, but it sure does feel like it.	There is a form of antagonist in this film that looks like a Disney channel original. An antagonist rides around in a giant bowling ball and sticks out of the holes. It's in color, it has to be from the last 40 years, but for the life of me I cannot find it. The uncomfortable segments of this film feel like return to Oz. I can only remember how uncomfortable I felt, no names or anything useful.	It's not return to Oz, but it sure does feel like it.

1l6kvyl	Looking for a horror/saw like movie	Soooo I watched a movie when I was younger that really scared me, but I only remember a few details. It involved a family a father, mother, daughter, and maybe a sonwho were trapped in what looked like a ""basement"" (I don't think the bottom was visible - it was just pitch black). Each family member was standing on a sort of step or platform that jutted out from the wall, almost like a staircase. One of the most vivid scenes I remember happened near the end of the film I think: the daughter's doll got stuck in a hatch or compartment of some kind, and its head was torn off (this was very scary as a child, since the doll looked really creepy in my memory). In my recollection, the family was able to escape mostly unharmed in the end. The doll could've had some greater significance? Unfortunately, that's all I can recall.

1l8vtbl	Shadow of a figure with beak in the shower	I once saw a scene in TV with a man in, what looked like, public showers. It was all white and he was washing himself with some soap. Behind him was either white tiled wall or white shower curtain, I'm not sure. Behind that curtain was a figure of a person, presumably male, with a beak like as if it was wearing a bird mask. This figure was walking from one side to the other and the man seemed unaware of its presence. Maybe because it was just some shadow/ghost. Again I'm not sure. But you could still hear the sound of fast footsteps on the wet tiles and someone's whistling. Either the man's or some other person's that was in the public showers. I've seen this somewhere around late 00's and early 10's. I don't even know if it was a scene in the movie, series or commercial. It might've been anything at this point. I have to find it. It haunts me to this day.	Shadow of a figure with beak in the shower I once saw a scene in TV with a man in, what looked like, public showers.

1l76imk	Does anyone know the name of these 4 movies :? that I have been looking for for many years	1 - Possibly a thriller. A hunter takes his son with him to the forest to hunt, there were still people in the forest, a shot rang out during the hunt, all the people came to look and saw the body of a young girl. It turned out that the hunter's son had raped her and she wanted to tell him about it, maybe she was blackmailing him, I don't remember exactly, and the hunter, having learned about it, shot her to save her son from punishment. Filmed presumably in the 90s-2000s. 2 - The film is probably old, before 2000, in which I remember such an action. A group of people sneak into someone's well-fortified apartment to kill a person. They manage to do it, and drive away in a car. And then another one of this gang appeared. His task is simply to shoot off the doorbell. Maybe I messed something up, but there was definitely a scene where they shoot at the doorbell! 3 - The film seems to be about a girl who is preparing for her friend's wedding, and she is unlucky in love. I remember 4 scenes exactly: - the main character tries on a dress. The dressmaker sews it right on her and the dressmaker says that the girl has one hip higher than the other - another scene, the main character goes on a date with a guy, they spend the night together at her apartment. In the morning, he says that he wanted to make breakfast, but she only had cereal; - then the heroine meets this guy at a bar with another girl, runs outside, the guy follows her and tells her that he is not the guy she needs; - and the last scene, this is the end of the film, the heroine is riding on a lake in a boat with a guy, he says that the boat rental time is ending, and the girl allegedly accidentally throws the paddle into the lake, she and the guy kiss. 4 - **Found** ~~A man goes into a pawnshop and asks the seller that he has a Rolex watch and he does not know if it is real or not. When he gives it to the seller to look at, the seller takes out the original and says how they are different, then the main character replaces the real watch with 2 copies of the fake watch~~	Does anyone know the name of these 4 movies :? that I have been looking for for many years 1 - Possibly a thriller.

1kp5hqy	Short film where a man laying in a chair gets killed by a machine with a drill/buzzsaw behind a curtain in a very white room.	I remember seeing this on a Air Canada flight's in-flight entertainment system as a kid I think around 2008-2012? I think the film was around 15 minutes long, and all I remember is the ending: A man is laying down on something like a dentist's chair, in a very white and clean room with a machine and a semi-transparent curtain next to him. The machine has a drill or a saw, and the final shot is of the curtain between us and the man and the machine, with the machine cutting into the man with blood splattering the curtain and dripping down. I've tried asking ChatGPT lol, which has been useful for finding movies, but I just can't get it to find this one.

1ki40zc	Looking for a (thriller? action?) film, with a scene between two partners in crime...	Hello! I'm looking for a film with the following scene: It's during the day. An African American man (driver) and his white partner in crime (they're literally criminals) are somewhere in an inconspicuous location, in a city, in a car. The African American man ""tests"" his partner, by faking an attempt to shoot him in the head (I forget why, maybe a trust issue). He doesn't shoot him, (and breaks down?) revealing he would never kill his partner because of their friendship and history, and that he was only testing him. All the while, his partner's eyes are boring holes in him, out of rage during the fake attempt. Words are exchanged, leading us to realize that he (the white partner) would shoot his partner without a second thought. The partner's face then completely changes as he's also caught on that his partner **would kill him**. He then tries to act cool so as not to give away the realization that his partner gives zero s**ts about him. So he puts the gun away, but somehow his partner gets the gun from him (or maybe he pulls out his own gun?) shooting him in the head. He then exits the car and walks away. Plz help me! Ty!

They had her hooked up to a bunch of hoses , and draining her and injecting her. It was like a seductive demon or vampire and I can't figure it out . Definatley a regular movie and it was early 2000's or late 90s? Im not sure but not new . I saw this as a kid with a group of cousins and I need to remember it .	Vampire Movie?

1ldwr0f	movie about a guy who kidnaps a little boy to save him from his family	There's a movie I'm looking for. I remember seeing a scene where a couple was fighting inside their house. This couple had a child who was just a kid and they were fighting. Then a guy comes into the house and knocks out her husband. She starts praising him, saying something like, ""You beat him up."" Then the guy picks up her son and puts him in his car and drives away. While he's driving away, the woman says something like, ""Where are you going with my son?"" ""You son of a bitch."" Then, later, this guy appears in a phone booth where another woman tells the guy on the phone that his mother called the police and that what he's doing is kidnapping. Then the guy gets in the car and goes back home, and when he gets there it is full of police officers and a police officer takes the boy and puts him in his mother's arms and the police officers handcuff the guy and put him in the police car, then the boy lets go of his mother and runs to the police car where the guy is and the guy says ""go back to your mother"" the place was at night.	movie about a guy who kidnaps a little boy to save him from his family There's a movie I'm looking for.

1l81fjh	Disturbing drug addiction movie scene	Hi all I remember this terrible scene from a movie where a drug addicted prostitute wants the shot from the dealer, but she has no money so he asks her for a blowjob. All's good if not for a single disgusting particular: his intimate parts are covered with filth and a ""white cream"", so she then proceeds to remove some of that and goes on with the job. It stuck in my mind for soooo long. Sorry for my bad English and thanks in advance!

1lb6g4k	Time travelling movie, mind bending, thriller	Edit: gonna put this list here coz there are some crazy suggestions being thrown at me. Films that it is NOT: ARQ, in time, about time, predestination, bttf, anon, 7 splinters in time, looper, FAQ about time travel, primer, equals, tenet, source code. Watched on Netflix, made after 2010, guy who has some sort of time traveling abilities. Everything is very dystopian, Grey and brutalist One scene that stuck in my head is the male protagonist meets a woman, they go back to her place and there's a knock at the door. The woman won't let the visitor in, our perspective at this point is inside the apartment so we can't see the visitor. The same scene plays out later in the film but from the perspective of the visitor, it's the same protagonist. Some point in the film the protag and the woman are talking outside by the entrance to a large concrete building with pillars on top of stairs. They male protagonist says goodbye and walks away, then he reappears from the other side but has no recollection of the conversation from 2 minutes ago. The woman exclaims how quick he was. The ending scene is of them in a bar or café talking about how much time he has now.

1lgly0q	Hockey comedy	Pretty generic sport movie, a guy joins a terrible hockey team and slowly gets them to improve and work together. The only scene I remember well is when the protagonist goes behind the goal and insults one of his teammates who has anger issues, who then hits the puck really hard to try and hit him but it goes into the goal. The protagonist is then happy that his trick worked and made him score.	Hockey comedy Pretty generic sport movie, a guy joins a terrible hockey team and slowly gets them to improve and work together.

1ljz4w4	Help me find this movie	Hi all. I remember watching this movie several years ago with my brother on TV. It was an English movie where there were 3 leads - two male and one female all of them in love with each other. The woman gets kidnapped by a gang and the other two men go hell and back to find her. In the end they do find her and rescue her. The movie ends with all three of them on a beach and the female saying something like ""Is it possible for three people to be equally in love with each other"" and some more dialogues. Neither of us remember the name but we remember a few of the scenes. It never aired again on the TV and I eventually forgot about the name. Does anyone have an idea of what it could be? Thanks.

1la6dqc	Classic black and white film about two doctors	When I was a child, I watched a film on TCM about two doctors, one older, one younger who were choosing to practice medicine for the underprivileged. I believe the theme of the film was the the struggle to choose making a choice that did the best good in the world vs what was most profitable. There was a particular brief scene that might help ID the movie more easily. During a montage I think a person had swallowed some kind of metal object, and the doctors were using the Xray machine in short bursts to guide the tool they were using to try to remove the object. This film looked like it was likely 40s-50s to my young eyes, but it could have been early 60s or even late 30s.

The next day they cant remember anything so they watch some of their video recording to see that the husband strangled the wife to death and buried her body, but she is still alive watching that footage right next to him. They find out later that by drinking that specific drink she has agreed to be some kind of an offering? like a sacrifice. And also theres a little girl who is also going to be sacrificed? for some reason. Theres bad weather so they cant leave the [island] so theyre stuck there.

1kmy1k5	Guy gets a ""job"", helps girl build website, website gets sabotaged. Finds out parents got him this job.	The main character starts off as a gamer living at his parents house. He gets a job at an office, meets a girl there, decides to help her build a startup website. Three brothers (who seem to also have their office in the same building) conspire to sabotage this website. The brothers are non-white/black, one of them is special needs and handles figuring out things (I think calculations) that the other two cannot. Office has an over sexual female worker for comedic relief and a boss that main character is trying to impress. He finally moves out of his parents house wooo At some point (I missed it) we find out that the girl he's helping with the website is also someone he's been gaming online with. She doesn't know it's him, but he knows it's her. She really admires him in the game. I believe his gamertag was Aimbot. There are small comic book flares thrown in throughout the movie, like in Scott Pilgrim, but to a much smaller degree. In the end, he find out he only got accepted into the program because his parents signed him up for it, insert lots of anger and resentment towards everyone, and that's about all i remember. I am not good with actors, but there were no big names. I feel like it was from this year, no confidence though.	Guy gets a ""job"", helps girl build website, website gets sabotaged.

1lixc6m	Trying to find a movie where a young man is secretly dating a woman whose daughter is close to him	I'm looking for a movie scene I remember vaguely. In it, a woman is having a sexual relationship with a much younger man. She has a young daughter, around 8 years old, who is very close and emotionally attached to the young man  but the girl doesnt know he's romantically involved with her mom. In one intense scene, the young man and the woman are having sex when the daughter walks in and discovers them. I remember that either the man or the girl cuts a finger on broken glass of a window (?), and the guy quickly covers his private parts with a lampshade. Theres also a gardener character, who is apparently the young man's boss and also the womans ex-husband. Throughout the movie, the gardener starts to suspect that his apprentice is sleeping with his ex-wife. I think I saw this on TV many years ago. Any idea what movie this could be?

1k7efks	Highschool comedy romance movie I've seen clips of	I've seen clips of this movie on YouTube a few years back but can't find it now. All I remember is that it's in an American highschool. The main characters are a duo of a guy and a girl. They like eachother but just don't realize they share the same feelings. They smoke weed in a school bus and hug in that scene. The guy starts tutoring popular girl and ends up sleeping with her. His friend girl is mad about this and he eventually comes to her house with a teacher rooting for their relationship. He climbs up her windows and the exchange dialogue about what's been happening and she undresses and cries and her dad walks in shocked and quickly leaves. Both friends then lay in bed to watch the spelling bee and she burps because she burps when she drinks beer. Please if anybody knows what this movie is I'd appreciate the help. I feel crazy lol.

1lk2q76	Possibly animated short film - god possesses tribal member through mask and tells the tribe to leave their home before a meteor/natural disaster	what movie/short film/tv show had this scene? Tribe migrating across wastelands from their soon to be destroyed home after three tribe members in a tent take turns wearing a mask to channel/communicate with their god, and a god speaks through one of them about a warning/prophecy that their homelands will be destroyed. They leave their home after deciding to put faith in the prophecy. I believe that person ends up being sacrificed or left behind on the pilgrimage. This may have been animated and in my memory I thought it was a Love Death and Robots short but I couldn't find any that matched it. Could have been an episode from a TV show.

Plot summary: - A strict, abusive, controlling mother is killed by the father and buried in the woods. - The son is haunted not by ghost, but by the psychological trauma of his mother. - Key scene: Father comes home drunk, vomits -- the mother (hallucinated by the son) yells at him to clean it up from across the table. The father stops the son, saying, You dont have to do that anymore  shes gone. - The haunting appears as a memory projection, not a ghost. Does anyone know this film?

1l410m7	2000s movie with child actors and a father character	Set in a vacationy setting with lots of water, swimming pools, a villa. Not too flashy, it is an indie movie I think. I do not recognize/recall any famous actors. Possibly foreign actors - South America maybe. But characters speak english entirely. No school setting at all, so it must be vacation time. Colour grading and tone similar to ""Three Billboards in Missouri"" but wayyy happier. Three scenes come to mind: 1. Kids (10-15 years) play around in a swimming pool. Atleast two of them playing the game of how long one can hold their breath under water. 2. The kids play a round of truth or dare, seated on the grass. One of the dare set by the lead child actress was to get two boys kiss each other. They do and them immediately pull apart, disgusted. All the kids laugh. 3. The lead child actress plays around with her father happily. Help me find the movie.

One of my favorite VHS tapes as a kid was a child-friendly documentary (?) about a farm in the US and what it was like to live and work there through the seasons. It showed milking the cows, rolling hay, tapping trees for maple syrup, sewing quilts, harvesting corn, and other farm tasks. It was more of an educational video about how the processes worked rather than focusing on the folks running the farm, though there were some humorous elements to it. I was hoping to find it streaming somewhere so I could show my baby nephew since he loves farm animals.	Childhood VHS tape about a farm through the seasons?

1kp9y5m	Cyborg movie from 80s? Early 90s maybe	Hi everyone, I saw this movie late night on a random movie channel as a child. It was an about Cyborgs. However, the Cyborgs are powered by human blood! Post-Apocalyptic setting with a human underground resistance fighting the Blood-powered Cyborgs. The only scene I remember is the Cyborg leader standing by some barrels of oil/gas and saying how useless the oil/gas is to them. Thanks for the help.	Cyborg movie from 80s?

There were two guys I think, and they were tryng to get to California because they thought things would be better there, like cleaner air and less industrial waste kind of better. They're driving cross country and at some point they pick up this native american girl and a dog named Radon. They meet the girl's brothers at some point and they assume the guys have been intimate with her so they say they're going to scalp them as punishment, but really they just cut off their hair. And that's about all I remember. They get to california eventually and it looks nicer but then the camera zooms out and pans over and there's like a nuclear plant or something just on the other side of a fence.

And the song was only the beginning by UNSECRET and moon water, and no it was not the procreate dreams trailer or the lost symbol which is all Google has been telling me could be a possibility. I have zero idea what this movie trailer could actually be, or if it even is a movie.

The zombie then made a sinister grin as blood poured out of her mouth and she held a knife. That's all I got lol. The voice emphasized LIVING DEAD for emphasis.

1ldqddc	Does anyone recognize this description?	In 2011, on his deathbed, my grandfather told my father of a film which neither he nor I have been able to find. The description goes as follows: three young men, one Jewish, one Muslim and one Christian are taught under the same instructor in the Middle Ages. The instructor was potentially a cardinal or priest, but he could have been something else, and the kids are either actual kids or young men. The film was probably older, but we are not sure. Given my grandfathers state at the time and given how fuzzy the memory must have been for my father, the plot I have laid out may not be entirely accurate, but any film befitting of that description or anything similar would be appreciated.

I can't remember and it's killing me.	Whats the movie where somebody is making fun of the song, Stay (I missed you) by Lisa Loeb and no it's not Hot tub Time Machine 2?

1kf3imm	Gaslighting Movie on Netflix	I need your help, Reddit. I watched a movie a few years ago about an African-American woman who was gaslit into thinking her husband was dead and that she was going crazy. She'd just moved into a new neighbourhood (I think) with her daughter. 2 people, who were working with her husband, were trying to convince her she was crazy. There was a fight/chase scene in the woods, I remember something about her wearing a white crocheted cardigan at some point and I think there may have been a child involved in the woods scene. It's a pretty modern film, I watched it on Netflix and cannot, for the life of me, remember the name of the movie. I was so sure that the main actress was Regina Hall, but I've checked through all her movies and can't see it. If anyone has seen it, please let me know as Chat GPT has been useless and now I'm thinking I dreamt it >r Many thanks!	Gaslighting Movie on Netflix I need your help, Reddit.

Its cool, they kinda merge into one thing halfway through the film. Just a very short artsy fartsy film but I absolutely cannot find it. I think the title was a short combination of numbers and letters, like I85 or something. I assume nobody will know it, idk if yall do avant garde shit but thanks.

1l66fes	South Asian Indian movie about a guy who takes revenge every Saturday	I saw this movie a while back with an Ex that I can't remember the name of, but it was super long so we didn't get to finish it. It was a South Asian Indian film (I don't know what specific region or dialect unfortunately, but I don't think it was specifically Bollywood) that was about a guy who promised his mother on her deathbed that he wouldn't lash out or fight people any day of the week except Saturdays. After she passed, he would make a list throughout the week of people who wronged him (usually genuinely bad people), and on saturday he would go find them and beat them up. If he didn't get to them by the end of that Saturday, he had to give up his grudge and just let it be. There was also a plot about a poor community being harassed by a genuinely evil cop who ends up killing a little girl. And another plot where I think the main protagonist was in love with his cousin who he hadn't seen in years? I should also note that the film is not only super long, but seemed to have an almost episodic pattern to how the plot would play out, as if it was multiple episodes of a show cut together. I know I got around 3-4 hours into it (and there was clearly another hour or more left to the story) when something unrelated to the movie came up and I had to stop watching. Any help figuring out what its called would be greatly appreciated, I really want to finish the movie and see how the story ended.

1lcbz4p	Actionish movie where the antagonist pulls up beside the protagonist in a car, stares at him for a second then hits a guardrail launching him off the road	In the scene referenced in the title, the star is being pursued by the bad guy in a car, at one point the bad guy pulls along side him and they have a brief staredown when out of nowhere the badguy hits a guardrail launching him off the road into the ditch, the scene is abrupt and a little funny in my opinion even if it wasn't intended that way. Any help tracking this movie down would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

The clip in particular was like ""A (Synonym of dystopian) America"" or close to that. I remember the narrator talking about how much changed and that woman were forced to wear hats or something and this one scene where people were at the airport and there were several people inside customs banging on the windows trying to get out. I don't know whether its a series or not or if this is too vague but I cannot find this documentary	I've been wondering what this Documentary/movie is Now I remember seeing this clip about a America that is dystopian or something close to that.

1kupkz6	TV movie during Full House's original run.	So with the last Final Destination movie coming, people love to talk about the log scene in part 2 and how they're using imagery based on that to promote the latest movie. I often counter that with ""I've got something almost as bad"" and I tell them about the multiple flatbed trucks I have seen with massive lengths of rebar on them that just out at least 2 feet past the end. And it always made me think of this TV movie from the 80s where a housewife was killed in a car accident at the beginning by- rebar on a truck going through the windshield. The plot of the movie was about her husband discovering she had a secret life and dealing with it. The wife was someone recognizable- it was likely not Lori Loughlin, but I feel like she must have been a love interest to Uncle Jesse on Full House before he married Lori in the show. She had darker hair than Lori Loughlin and might have played a meaner character than was usual on that show, but I might have seen her doing that elsewhere.	TV movie during Full House's original run.

1kiqy5w	Demonic amputation	Late night in the mid to late 90s I remember channel surfing and catching glimpses of of horror movie on HBO or Stars possibly. Movie was from early to mid 90s possibly late 80s. The scene I can recall the most featured a man sawing his legs off and laughing crazily as a young woman walked by possibly into a house through an open door. From what I gather there was an incident of mass hysteria or demonic possession and people were going crazy and killing each other, cannibalism may have been involved. It's not any of Saw series. It was more of a demon/zombie apocalypse, hell on earth vibe.

1kum2fk	Horrormovie or timeloop stuff with teens	Might be a movie around 2000-2016. I remember there were late teenagers or twentysomething in something like a psychiatric ward or young delinquents setting. At first they were not friendly with each other. A guy and a girl fell in love and weird stuff was happening, like time was repeating itself or there was a timeloop. I think a lot of their friends died and in the end they found out a male friend was the culprit or he tried to get away while killing them or something. It wasn't a comedy and also no triple A movie, a bit cheap and dark. I think in the end the guy and girl (she had dark hair?) made it out alive.

However, there's a company (something like that) that wants to use it for its own benefit by turning it into energy drinks and thus making people dependent. However, when the kings oppose it, they are frozen by the Kingdom's guard (which has a design similar to stormtroopers), and the only one who doesn't suffer any harm is the daughter. She goes in search of help and among the species that help her there is an extraterrestrial that looks like a teenager, who is green and has orange hair and one of her characteristics is that she is part of a show juggling, but when she makes a mistake she becomes someone big and her voice changes making her look intimidating.

It was sort of a documentary style film. It had little to no talking. The plot was about a girl on a rural farm who harvested honey, and when a large family moves into the farm next to her they disrupt the bees with their noise and cattle. Its definitely not American, but I do think its a recent movie (last 20 years?) becuase its in color. It might be a European or south American film, Im sorry but other than that Im not sure. I do know the subject of the class at the time was climate change so it Might be based around that in some way.

1lh4ivz	Find a movie - legal assistance - rape scene	Hi, Im looking for the name of a film that contains a particularly nasty rape scene. There were soldiers I think and they had a number of women in a cell. I believe one of the women argues with a soldier and so the soldier holds her over something like a table and rapes her with a bar/pole/handle in front of the other women. I would like to find this film as it was shown to a young girl who is now part of legal proceedings.

1l7n1ch	Movie about a car accident that led to the death of a couple´s child. The story moves around a nurse that is helping the couple´s wife surpass her depression while at the same time cheating with her husband	I remember watching a softporn movie many, many years ago about a car accident in which a couple lost their daughter because she refused to wear her seatbelt. The couple´s wife went insane and in a hard depression refusing to accept the death of the child. So the husband requested further help to her psychiatrist who sent a beautiful, blonde nurse to their house to help them. The nurse helped the couple´s wife a lot and she began to recover from her depression. However, at the same time the nurse started to seduce the husband, first making naked yoga in her bedroom and later with complete cheating sex. Eventually, the nurse decided that it was finally time to tell the couple´s wife that her daughter had indeed died on the car accident but the couple´s husband banned her from doing that because he believe it would bring the depression back. He then killed the nurse and shortly after the Police arrived at his home. He then finally gave up and became insane while his wife was taken to an insane asylum	Movie about a car accident that led to the death of a couple´s child.

1kncgn3	Old wacky comedy/zombie movie	Ok so I watched it when I was a kid around 2008 or something, it was American for sure and it was not like vintage black and white old but certainly old. The movie belongs to a zombie/comedy genre. It starts off with a group of survivors on a roof catapulting bodies off the street (I know its wacky as hell). And then they tried to come up with a plan to get out of the town. And so along the way (cant remember what they went through), there would be some hilarious out of place characters like a cowboy and an asian ninja man (most memorable part), and all of them would have this promo introduction like the WWE. And then there is one pretty memorable scene that MAYBE could help, is when they were going through a big sewer crawled with zombies. They were all running try to reach a ladder, and then the ninja guy who at this point has lost both of his arms, realised that he was done for, so he stayed back and started kungfuing with his legs against the zombies trying to buy some time. It was so funny and kinda dark so it made such an impression on me. And thats literally it, I cant remember any other single detail. My aunt bought it as like a secondhand scuffed dvd from a garage sale. But the production was great from what I remember. Also the premise and the jokes was pretty racist and outta pocket so someone must have seen it.

I dont remember what happened to the younger sister but I remember the older sister got together with the guy from work. I watched it during the time the ramen girl first came out on Netflix.

Only the aliens partner had been tortured by humans and is now free and torturing the people trapped on the island. The one identifiable scene I can remember Clearly is a person is strung up while the alien use the device to insert into her ear and effectively pulls out her eardrum and it goes from there. Based off what I remember probably a 80s movie although I watched it in the 90s. Oh, and the aliens are definitely like the typical gray aliens with big heads.	90s or 80s?

I can´t recall many details, but basically, a brother and sister go visit (or live with) their sick (or dying) mother. When they arrive, they discover she is living together with a book writer, who is writing a book about her death. I also remember that at some point, the brother and the book writer have sex, and in another scene, the whole family goes on a walk in the woods and they smoke weed together.

1kp9uzy	Someone told me before&	I happened upon a modern movie (15-ish years ago) that looked like it was set in the 70s or 80s. A man was investigating cults / cult crimes (maybe even supernatural?) via microfiche in a (university?) library and he was either a journalist or radio personality. I know this is a long shotI feel like I explained the plot years ago to coworkers and they told me the name of the film, but Ive forgotten. Anyone seen or have any idea of what Ive described?

1ldyegv	Guys Find Me This Movie	<¬ [TOMT][Movie][2010s] Looking for a fantasy/drama movie with a girl entering a hidden workshop through a ceiling hatch in a side alley Hey everyone, Ive been trying to remember the name of a film I watched on TV sometime between 2010 and 2020, possibly a few years back. I watched it dubbed in Turkish, so the original might be in English or another language. Heres everything I remember: - The main character is a young woman (2030 years old), with black or dark brown hair. - Shes walking through a crowded but normal-looking side alley/street, with people passing by. - She stops near a metal ladder attached to the wall, climbs it, and opens a round, ceiling hatch using some kind of lever or mechanism. - The hatch is in the ceiling, not the wall or floor. She climbs up and enters. - Inside is an old workshop or studio  it looks like an art or paint workshop. There are likely tools, colors, possibly paint or similar materials. - Theres someone else in the workshop  possibly a relative or close acquaintance (mentor, parent, or friend). - The workshop or base seems hidden from the public, almost secretive but not magical  just private. - Later in the movie (or throughout), there are sword-based battle scenes. Possibly fantasy or war themes, maybe historical fantasy. - The movie is not a TV series, and Im pretty sure its not a Netflix production. - It is not animated, not a kids' movie, and not a dystopian sci-fi  more like drama/fantasy/adventure. - I watched it dubbed on a Turkish TV channel, maybe something like Cine5, Star, Kanal D, Show TV, or TNT, etc. What it is NOT: - Not The Secret Life of Walter Mitty - Not Divergent, Hunger Games, City of Ember, or any major YA franchise - Not Harry Potter, Narnia, Maze Runner, or Percy Jackson - Not animated or stylized  it was live action, with real actors - Not Franklyn, Witchville, Underworld, or Aeon Flux I tried AI tools and movie databases, but no exact match came up. If this rings a bell for anyone  even a partial title or actor  Id really appreciate it! Thanks in advance! =O #findmovie #whatsthemovie	Guys Find Me This Movie <¬ [TOMT][Movie][2010s] Looking for a fantasy/drama movie with a girl entering a hidden workshop through a ceiling hatch in a side alley Hey everyone, Ive been trying to remember the name of a film I watched on TV sometime between 2010 and 2020, possibly a few years back.

1lgycal	horror film and another random one	okay ive been searching for this movie for probably over 5 years. it was a horror movie with a women (I think blonde, but definitely white) who lived in this nice big house on a hill, she might've just moved in. turns out the house is haunted and she cant leave. a delivery driver (white, brunette) comes to the house and she's at the door which is glass, she tells the man not to come in or else he wont be able to leave. being the hero he is he comes in and tries to help her. they fight off some sort of demon or ghost or whatever, and I remember him using a pentagram to ward them off somehow. then I remember a scene near the end in the garage maybe where the women and delivery driver were there faced with the ""demon"" and it turns out one of them was actually working with the demon and had been stuck in this house for ages and had to get a replacement to be able to leave. the next one its not like it was even a good movie but I just want to find the name of it because it was interesting, at least what I can remember. might be a thriller movie, maybe just drama. there's two sisters, one sister I think the younger one wins this like giveaway/raffle or something online that is a free beach holiday with lots of others. basically a party holiday. they might've been like brought to this warehouse and brought to this place discreetly. I remember they arrived on a boat to a beach party with drinks and a dj. this holiday turns out to be like some sort of ploy, maybe a cult. the sister didn't tell anyone about this, so older sister thinks she is missing, but finds out about this free holiday thing. she finds out somehow its bad. she then enters this giveaway thing to try to save her sister but act like another party girl and pretends not to know her sister when she gets there. they are on an island so they cant escape but somehow I think they do I don't remember for sure tho. thank you! some of this is most likely inaccurate or even made up, but the main plot is right unless I dreamt them.	horror film and another random one okay ive been searching for this movie for probably over 5 years. it was a horror movie with a women (I think blonde, but definitely white) who lived in this nice big house on a hill, she might've just moved in. turns out the house is haunted and she cant leave. a delivery driver (white, brunette) comes to the house and she's at the door which is glass, she tells the man not to come in or else he wont be able to leave. being the hero he is he comes in and tries to help her. they fight off some sort of demon or ghost or whatever, and I remember him using a pentagram to ward them off somehow. then I remember a scene near the end in the garage maybe where the women and delivery driver were there faced with the ""demon"" and it turns out one of them was actually working with the demon and had been stuck in this house for ages and had to get a replacement to be able to leave. the next one its not like it was even a good movie but I just want to find the name of it because it was interesting, at least what I can remember. might be a thriller movie, maybe just drama. there's two sisters, one sister I think the younger one wins this like giveaway/raffle or something online that is a free beach holiday with lots of others. basically a party holiday. they might've been like brought to this warehouse and brought to this place discreetly.

1lez9b0	Horror movie about Father who promises to kill Daughter	Apologies if this gets long. I saw this movie in theaters sometime between 2005 and 2011. From what I can remember, a woman is somehow responsible for a young man's death (car accident or equivalent). The woman has a daughter. The dead man's father, who's a farmer or something rural, promises that, upon the daughter's 18th or 21st birthday (can't remember but one of the biggies), he will kill the daughter as revenge. The father dies, but the mother continues to see his ghost, like when she wakes up and sees him in a mirror across from her bed. Meanwhile, the daughter -- now days from the fated birthday -- is enormously suspicious of an 11 year-old neighbor that has just moved in, as she believes that reincarnation can be achieved after 11 years and therefore the neighbor boy is the dead father. On the night of the birthday, the father's ghost returns but before he can harm the daughter, the neighbor boy comes and says, ""dad, don't,"" revealing he was actually the reincarnated dead son. Then, once the dad leaves, the neighbor boy snaps out of his reverie and is confused about how he got there. Please help. Only my sister and I remember this movie but I'm so certain that I saw it.

1la6f3c	90s English romance with pyschological horror	Hi everyone, Im trying to find a movie I watched about 20 years agoprobably made in the 90s or even 80s. I believe it was set and filmed in England, maybe around Oxford, Cotwalds or somewhere with manor houses and posh characters. The lead was a young English gentleman with a refined accent. Its hard to classify the film. It was a love story and felt like a romance but with strong elements of eroticism, horror, and mysteryvery BBC in tone and production style. From what I remember, the story starts with the main character swimming in a river with a woman. After the swim, she tries to kiss him, but he rejects her. He then meets another womanexotic, possibly Eastern Europeanwith a sultry accent. They fall deeply in love and share several steamy, chemistry-filled scenes. One took place in a kitchen during morning tea. At one point, a vicar overhears them and calls out to check if everything's alright, nearly walking in on them in the final throws of passion. The woman quickly calls back, just managing to stop him from entering. Amidst all the intimacy, a creeping sense of the supernatural grows. Strange myterious and dark elements start to subtly appear. For instance, they are in the attic in an old, country house and violin music starts to come from an empty room downstairs. The woman is petrified and stops the husband investigating. In another scene, a cushion suddenly transforms into a creepy stuffed turtle. The womans mental state deteriorates as the hauntings intensify. I have a vague memory of a scene where the woman looks over the side of a boat at niggt and sees something mirky and dark beckoning her to jump in. All the horror was disturbing but subtle and more psychological in nature. In the final scene, theyre on a desolate beach on a cold, overcast day. As they begin to make love, a horrifying, ghostlike entity begins drifting toward them from the ocean. They both scream. I dont remember what happens nextpart of me thinks it had a happy ending, but Im not sure how. Ive thought about this movie every week for years and have searched everywhere with no luck. If anyone recognises it, Id be forever grateful. I was a teenager when I saw it, so some details might be fuzzy.

While the second person is away, a woman nearby invites the first guy to sit elsewhere (or maybe he just moves). Then the second person comes back from the bathroom, and when he tries to get his seat back, the first one pretends not to know him, or acts like its all in the past. He says something like: Come on, just let it go now. Stop bothering us. And starts saying Shhh like hes just a random guy annoyed in the theater. Eventually, the guy who went to the bathroom is forced to leave the theater. I remember it being a comedy series, possibly American. Any idea what this show could be? Thanks a lot!	Show Title Hi!

1l72tnf	Remote, mountain therapy facility, main character starts to feel something strange is happening, tree pods, huge underground basement	I saw this movie before covid I believe in 2019. I dont know how or where i saw it. Felt like a horror or thriller movie off of hulu. The main character had some fight with her husband and she has ended up on this remote mountain facility that looked like a huge modern mansion. So its pretty secluded and basically traps their patients with nowhere to go. The mc starts to feel strange and weird things happening, the patients are weird and idk if they start disappearing or what but something makes her want to escape. When she tries she is not successful. ----------Spoiler------- Later in the movie the MC finds a way into the basement, and the basement looks huge, like an underground base, as she goes further in she finds out that the staff of this facility are turning patients into tree pods, like while the patients are alive. So the movie felt pretty new when I watched it so i t couldnt have been older than 2015-2019. Might have been foriegn like from europe, sweden or some place but it was in english mostly. Pleasse help i've been looking for this!!!

I remember the ending the most some people have to choose a child to sacrifice or offer I guess to a demon or monster so itll leave. I believe they were in a church and it was winter time. Anyways the demon/monster takes the child and flies off into the night sky and thats the ending.

1lh37cc	[TOMT][Movie][Korean] Looking for a melancholic Korean film about a man who is hired to break up with people on behalf of his clients	Hi everyone, Im looking for the title of a Korean feature film I watched online a few years ago (possibly around 20152020). Heres what I remember: "" The main character is a lonely, melancholic man who offers a unique service: hes hired by people to personally visit their partners and tell them the relationship is over. "" He goes to clients houses, rings the doorbell, and delivers the breakup message face to face. "" Hes doing this professionally, and there are several clients shown throughout the film. "" He works alone  there is no team or agency involved. "" The film has a sad, slow, emotional tone  not a comedy at all. "" The production felt high quality (not low-budget), and it was a feature-length film, not a short. "" Im 90% sure it was South Korean, and the dialogue was in Korean. Ive tried searching everywhere but havent been able to find the title. If anyone recognizes this film, Id be really grateful! Thanks in advance.

At the end of the movie when kids get to their grandmas house, the mailman is normal size and nice. And Im pretty sure they offered him lemonade or something. Some of the background was cgi.

Early in the movie, I feel like her and some friends and brother arrive at either (a) a family vacation home (b) vacation cabins/resort. I have always believed that they were there for a wedding. I also want to believe that something involving her ex-boyfriend was happening (my strongest idea is thats were there for his wedding). Here is the absolute strongest memory I have. They are at some kind of party (like maybe either a day before the wedding celebration or the reception?) here she is talking to her gay brother and confides that all she wants is what he and his husband has. He reveals to her that their relationship has fallen on hard times and (I think) they are getting a divorce. She says something like if you two cant make it.. who can? Its nothing like Family Stone or Wedding Date. If it was made in the last six years.. its definitely not it. Any help would be appreciated.

1lf1ypu	Old 3d animated movie about leaving a big ol' tree	I remember watching this sometime before my teens, It's about a girl (I think?) that lives on a huge tree along with her village but the tree is dying and the sap they all live on is drying up and so they need to leave/find another source of sap. In the process of looking around for such a thing she almost gets eaten by a flying monster with a looong-ass tongue, finds a metal knife(I might be misremembering that) and fights a giant made of wood piloted by sap demons. Maybe. Towards the end they find the source of sap, and the sap demons who guard it and want to add the whole village of ¨sap thieves¨ to it. The movie ends with the protagonist leaving the tree for the world below. I think, its been awhile. I saw this movie sometime in the 2010s I'm pretty sure, might be later though. Everything was 3d animated, I am fairly sure of that.

I cant find this movie in the Netflix in my home country. It was an Asian movie, I think Thai or Korean. The story begins in the kitchen where i tought the mother is cooking and the father wants to stab his wife down, but he doesn't want this because he seems possessed. Later on, this woman is paralyzed in bed, her husband is dead and she has 2 daughters. Her older daughter takes care of her. Sometimes the brother of her deceased husband comes by to see how the children are doing. But his wife keeps calling him, and then he lies where he is. The uncle also said that they have to tape the mirror in her mother's room because of the ghosts. It turns out that there was a ritual in the basement a long time ago. And that spirit takes over the offspring or something. On one time the mother acts 'normal' again and the younger sister really likes this.. mother is brushing her hair and playong hide and seel together.. the older child knows this is not her mother.. The uncle is also killed while driving home. Because he found out that their mother carries the devil with her. Does anyone know what movie this is called?	Help me find this movie Hi all!

The story begins in the kitchen where i tought the mother is cooking and the father wants to stab his wife down, but he doesn't want this because he seems possessed. Later on, this woman is paralyzed in bed, her husband is dead and she has 2 daughters. Her older daughter takes care of her. Sometimes the brother of her deceased husband comes by to see how the children are doing. But his wife keeps calling him, and then he lies where he is. The uncle also said that they have to tape the mirror in her mother's room because of the ghosts. It turns out that there was a ritual in the basement a long time ago. And that spirit takes over the offspring or something. On one time the mother acts 'normal' again and the younger sister really likes this.. mother is brushing her hair and playong hide and seel together.. the older child knows this is not her mother.. The uncle is also killed while driving home. Because he found out that their mother carries the devil with her. Does anyone know what movie this is called?

1lbxchv	Looking for a thriller-esque movie from the 90s or 00s	I remember having seen a small fraction of this movie on TV many years ago. It was something in the vein of a crime-thriller, the atmosphere was definitely pretty dark, it took place during winter somewhere in the US around a bigger city (not NY, more Denver, Chicago or Philadelphia vibes), think Fargo but without any of the comedy. The only ""scene"" I'm able to recall is a character (idk if it was the pro- or antagonist) going from his standard suburban single family home to a mall with his car. Either he went there to investigate something shady going on or he had something going on at his house he was trying to keep a secret. Any help is appreciated!

1lg4h9p	[MOVIE TITLE][HORROR][1990s] Woman's eyes are taped open with needles, her boyfriend gets stabbed under the chin	Hello everyone, I'm desperately looking for the title of a horror movie I saw when I was a kid, around age 10, so probably early 90s (but maybe late 80s or a little later). I have very vague memories, but one scene marked me for life. In this scene, a woman is tied up, and her eyelids are held open with what looked like needles, taped to prevent her from closing her eyes. She is forced to watch what is happening. Her boyfriend then enters the room, without suspecting what is happening. He approaches her, then the killer appears and sticks a knife under her chin. We see the blade coming out through the mouth in a very graphic and shocking shot. That's all I remember, but this scene had a deep impact on me. Does that mean anything to anyone? The title of the film or even a clue would help me enormously. Thanks in advance !

1leo60r	Need help finding war movie	I am so sorry for the lack of details but I have been searching for this movie since I saw it in class about 7 years ago. All I remember was that it was a war movie, which war it was or if it was a real one, I dont know. The scene I remember was when they were fighting in the air, with planes, both sides were going at each other and the enemy had downed a plane. The plane crashed but the pilot was able to get out and land safely on the ground. He celebrated being alive before the same plane started gunning him down while he was running on the ground. It was a war crime I believe, so when an enemy plane saw what its comrade had done, when he was behind a main characters plane, he let him go. He did that because he knew it was wrong what his friend did and so spared a main characters life. Please help me find it, its been on my mind for forever!

Rough recreation included.	The recreation may be somewhat inaccurate in certain details given that I last saw it nearly 20 years agoamong them the size of the gemstone (it might have been smaller, at least initially)but it should otherwise give a fair idea of what the scene looked like. My memory of it is somewhat foggy, somewhat of a surreal, hallucinatory experience, so I do have a bit of doubt about its existence. I don't think I could make something like this up, however, and the memory's stayed with me for years up until now. If someone can find it, interesting things could occur afterwards, though I can't guarantee anything necessarily.

It was a staff pick at the local indie rental place down the road, and was probably a filmfest sort of movie. Anyway, as best as I recall it was set in the 1920s with a bunch of rich college students(?) spending their summer at someones summer home in Newport or the Hamptons, or something of the sort. I think theyd go for a daily swim, then one day one of them hits their head diving in and doesnt come back up. It was big on this underwater action shot of them diving in Thanks!

1l8tmby	Black and white film noir similar to Detour	Many years ago I watched a scene from an old film noir that really stuck with me. Its similar to a scene in Detour, but Im pretty sure its not that movie. In the scene, there are two men (not a man and a woman) driving in a car, having a casual conversationpossibly one of them is a hitchhiker. Suddenly, the driver turns to the passenger and asks something like, 'What did you do with the body?' He explains that he figured out the other man had killed someone, just based on a small detail mentioned earlier in their conversation -something to do with gardening, gloves, or something along those lines. The reveal was brilliant and totally unexpected - it left a deep impression on me. I dont remember much else. I saw it dubbed into Spanish sometime in the late 1990s, but Im almost certain the film itself is from the 1950s or earlier. Also, it didnt look too low-budget, so it was probably a fairly well-known film at the time. Does this ring any bells for anyone?

1lby0qr	Remember seeing an old Asian wushu/martial arts movie dubbed in Cambodian with cheesy special effects as a child in the 90s	First time posting, ever. I apologize if I do it wrong This has been bugging me for years. I've asked my Mom about it, but in her old age she can't remember it very well It was an old Asian movie. I'm assuming the original language was Chinese, but it was dubbed in Cambodian I remember the main character was a female, I THINK I remember her being dressed in green, as a sort of Amazonian warrior of sorts. Her weapon was a spear, that I vaguely remember having a striped design almost like a barber pole or a candy cane And then I also remember, I believe it was the main villain, was an elder male. And his technique of fighting was this sort of thousand-palm technique where his open palm extended out like a sort of Go-Go Gadget Palm technique I don't remember much else during the movie, but I remember the ending because it reminded of the old Shaw Brothers Classic, Five Elements Ninjas The ending featured a bunch of 1v1 battles, I'm assuming Good Vs Evil The main protagonist, the Amazonian female with the spear fought against an antagonist that fought with a spider web. And the elderly villain used his Go-Go Gadget Palm technique again. I unfortunately don't remember any of the other fights And then finally at the end of the battles, I remember the various fighters involved sitting upon clouds and flying upwards. Almost as if they were ascending Unfortunately this is all I can remember. I'll try to ask Mom some more the next time I see her. See if I can jog her memory Apologies if this is somehow not formatted correctly. I am a terrible person and unworthy	Remember seeing an old Asian wushu/martial arts movie dubbed in Cambodian with cheesy special effects as a child in the 90s First time posting, ever.

1lixoia	What is this movie?	I watched a found footage movie on Crackle sometime back in 2017/ 2018 and I can't find it for the life of me. It starts out with a group of younger people that get in a car and drive into the woods to explore this abandoned, fallin down building. I remember most of it wasn't standing anymore. They found some stairs to a basement, but they argued about going down. One guy went alone and they ran down to find him and found lots of passageways and rooms with alters and shrines. They decided to leave but found that when they ran through the woods to get back to their car they would end up back at the building. Like they were cursed and stuck there.	What is this movie?

1lbvi83	Creepy movie about a kidnapper	I had a weird afternoon dream this saturday, and was reminded of a creepy movie I watched with my parents in cable TV once. I think the movie is from the 90s - 00s. It was about two brothers and a single father. The big brother's name was Teddy or a diminutive of his name, he had a black friend whom he played ball with I think. The younger brother always rode a toy car. There was a creepy old man with a hat who was always smoking. He had glasses I think. The man owned a bunch of dogs. There was also a small kid a little bit older than the younger brother who was always near the old man. One day the older small kid lured the younger brother with the old man, and I think he did bad things to him, because when the father found the younger brother, the younger brother was mute in shock I think. The father got angry with the older kid and destroyed the older kid's family car with a baseball bat. The older brother kept spying the creepy old man. I dont remember more details except the ending, were the creepy old man gets eaten by his own dogs, the older small kid is seen smoking during halloween I think, and the younger brother starts talking again. Could you please help me find the name of this movie? Its very strange I just got reminded of that movie this saturday.

"" The atmosphere outside is cold and darklike a blue-toned night scene. "" He walks toward a café, which is warm, cozy, and brightly lit from the inside.

"" He doesnt say anything, doesnt make a scenehe just stands there for a second, clearly emotionally distraught, then quietly turns around and walks back to his car.

He was interested in eastern philosophy, a practicing vegetarian, and uninterested in social activities. I remember two scenes fairly clearly: the other students calling him out for hypocrisy because he was wearing leather shoes, and one student in an office attempting to increase his course load, arguing that he was more than capable, he had been valedictorian.

1li719g	Movie with cyclone/twister people?!?	I need y'alls help. I was talking with a friend about old shows and movies we used to watch growing up. And recalled of this movie I would rent from Blockbuster in the early 2000's involving cyclone or tornado people. Picture a mermaid in the sky and instead of a tail the bottom half is a twister. Does anyone know what show/movie this was? I tried Googling and the closest thing I could find was Sky Dancers. However, I don't remember any animation in sky dancers where the people have twisters on the lower half of their body. I did watch sky dancers so did I perhaps combine two things together in my mind? Or did I make this show up entirely? Does anyone know what movie I'm talking about? It's driving me crazy to remember this so vividly but not know the name.	Movie with cyclone/twister people?!?

1l9y48k	Need help remembering the title of a horror movie	I remember coming across a movie online where I skipped to the end. The ending took place at an insane asylum where the main character encounters the movie's villain. Apparently, the villain was wearing someone else's skin and was really a man named ""Kerwyn"", or something like that. So anyway, the two begin fighting in the room they're in and Kerwyn starts biting on the man's flesh until the latter pulls out a bottle that's called ""reflux"" or something. Kerwyn said, ""So you have the reflux. What are you going to do with that exactly?"" So then the main character throws the reflux at a skeleton that was on the room. The skeleton being the man who Kerwyn stole the skin from. The skeleton becomes reanimated and attacks Kerwyn where his flesh starts starts to meld with the skeleton and in a bright flash of light, the two vanish away. That's all I remember as I didn't actually check out the rest of the movie, but apparently it had plenty of monsters in it. Anyone know what movie I'm talking about?

1l676vk	Lesser known thriller movie from the 2000s.	I'm looking for a movie I saw on T.V around 2014-16 and it looked like the movie came out in the late 2000s. It is a thriller film where a group of people are responsible for the deaths of wealthy people. It was in English and looked like an American or Canadian production with no known actors. The opening of the movie shows a middle aged lady playing tennis at a club and when she is about to start her car, it explodes. It appears to be one of several such attacks by a group of people who are masquerading as activists. The female protagonist is dating a guy who may be a part of the same group and she becomes suspicious. There is another scene where a guy kills a woman (female protagonist's friend) by breaking into her house with an indoor pool. Some earlier replies on other forums have mentioned The East (2013), however, it is not the one I'm looking for.	Lesser known thriller movie from the 2000s.

1la5dfl	Looking for a relatively old movie I watched when I was young	This post might be a little unhelpful because I only have one very formative memory of this movie, but I remember a few key details. I'll list the details before I describe the specific memory I have: \- The movie was fully animated and hand-drawn from what I remember, and maybe even watercolor was used. \- The movie had to have been made before 1990 based on what I remember it looking like. \- I'm pretty sure the protagonists were a small group of young animals (anthropomorphic, not literal animals). \- I very, very vaguely remember a scene where they're in the house of like a wise old animal that tells them to be careful on their journey or something (I can't remember, this detail is very foggy and most likely the most inaccurate and unhelpful) Okay, now the specific memory I have that is the only real reason I even kind of remember this movie: I remember a scene where the protagonists come across one of the animals from the main group's homes (I think it was a mole character, so their house was like a tunnel in the ground or something), except it's near a road and there is now a crashed chemical truck right near the home spreading chemical gas around. In a panic, the mole character rushes into their home to find that it is engulfed in the poisonous gas, and they come across their parents who are slumped in their dining table chairs, dead. The mole character desperately tries to wake up their parents, and the other main characters have to come into the house to drag away the mole to prevent them from passing out or dying from the gas. That is the most vivid memory I have of this movie, but the details are still foggy. This movie has been in the back of my mind for almost years now, so any help is appreciated.

1k5t2if	A friend group of four American tourists are in England when the apocalypse strikes.	Im almost 100% sure that the main characters name was Jim, and he had two friends who were boyfriend and girlfriend, as well as another guy friend that MAY have been British but idk. They were in a sort of coffee shop when the apocalypse hit with infected people (similar to rage zombies from 28 days later). A female worker at the coffee shop ran off with them as they survived and stuff. The one guy friend died after turning, and then the boyfriend gets bit. He proposes to his girlfriend in an abandoned hospital before he turns and then he bites her and she dies and stuff. Then the woman and Jim go and meet the womans sister at a random place (I dont remember where) with another weird old guy there who had his infected wife tied to the bed and refused to kill her. The movie ended with the woman, Jim, and the womans sister hiding in an abandoned church on the balcony while infected chased after them and crowded around the church, looking out over the city and countryside. The ending shot was of Jims nose bleeding onto his hand (I think). It was filmed in a sort of shaky camera way, Im pretty sure? It had a bit of a depressing grey sheen over it and the sky was always grey. This has been driving me up the wall for YEARS, I watched it like once when I was younger and I want to see it again, but I just cant remember the name =- I really hope this isnt obscure or lost media.

1leypgz	Help me find this movie (or did I dreamed it by mixing up movies scenes? idk)	I watched it I think 10 years ago but could be a little less Vibe : castle, a little bit of fantasy I remember a scene of a girl in a carriage embroidering... in the beginning I think. She was sitting next to another woman. The main story was about a guy that can transform in a animal I think? A black beast, either a feline or some kind of dog/wold. I think at some point in the movie we see in the mirror the animal walking. Also there is a scene of a man in a big room with a piano I swear the more I recall those scenes the more I feel like I dreamed this movie At some point there is the girl (I think the mc is the girl that was embroidering in the beginning) who face kinda bag guys in the forest but nothing too intense and I think she wins The one scene I'm 99% sure i did not dreamed and it's real, is the ending, where they are all reunited around in a grey/shiny place The 1% remaining is because I feel like there is a licorn in the ending but still not sure LMAO I can't help my only comfort is that I don't think it's a movie too obscure/unknown if it exists Also maybe I invented this scene so don't focus on it, but a scene in some sort of kitchen which is kinda outside? As if there is a balcony Edit 1: Typos + Maybe the main focus was not on the guy that can transform, but rather on the girl (makes sense since she's the mc). Also he is older than the girl and there is no romance between them.

1ksxgoa	Crazy accidental sex scene from a Japanese series or film	This is from a ""Top 10"" compilation I watched on YouTube when I was 10. This scene was included in the compilation. It begins in a hospital setting on the 2nd or 3rd floor where this patient is on a rolling metal cart which is rolling towards an open window. Down in a courtyard below, there is a nurseI don't remember what she was doing exactly. The metal cart hits the wall and the dude flies out of the window. He is wearing nothing except for a hospital gown, which flies off as he sails through the air, and he lands on her in a sex position and they somehow have sex. I've thought about this from time to time over the years, and would appreciate if someone could help identify what show/movie this was from so I can watch it again for the laughs. Thanks!

1kgc9as	Trying to remember an old black and white movie  maybe French? Heeelp	Hi! Im trying to remember a movie I watched years ago, probably on late-night TV (I think it was TV Cultura in Brazil). It was black and white and mightve been French, but Im not 100% sure. There are a few scenes I remember: Theres this young blonde woman who works at some kind of mens store  couldve been shoes, but Im not certain. A man whos older, kind of chubby and not very good-looking, goes there often. He seems to really like her and even asks her to marry him at some point, but she doesnt feel the same. Then one day, this super handsome guy shows up  kind of like a young Marlon Brando. They dont say anything, but they clearly feel something. The tension builds and they end up having sex right there in the store. Afterward, he just gets up and leaves without a word, and she stays on the floor, looking really sad or empty. The next day, that older guy comes back, and this time she agrees to marry him  I think maybe because she was disappointed or hurt by what happened with the other guy. Theres also another part I remember: a young boy is in love with a beautiful older woman. He keeps waiting outside her house to see her. In one scene, he tells her he loves her, and she kisses him on the lips  just a quick, kind kiss. Thats all Ive got. If anyone has any clue what movie this could be, Id be super grateful!

1k655vt	70/80s movie off a commercial	Im sure is a stretch but Im wondering if anybody can give me the name of this movie. I never saw it but I do remember the commercials as a kid (Born in 68). Pretty sure it was in the 70s but I cant remember if it was early mid or late, but I think this movie was spurred off of space Odyssey. I just remember there being a lot of space movies at that time. The commercial had a guy and what I believe was like shuttle, returning from space and he was burned up and reentry. I believe the plot was he survived and lived as a monster or something. Never saw the movie as I was too young but Ive always remembered the commercial and wondered what this movie was.

1lgt6l1	What's the movie or show?	There is a movie or show where a man is in a sparse room with a table. Its modern, simple, quasi futuristic. The man is monologuing. Its a raw, tense, rumination in defence of himself. His voice is loud but at the end its quieter. He is ranting about life and choices and how some times life come as you fast and you have to make choices and sometimes you make the wrong choice and sometimes those choices have consequences. I am inclined to want to believe it's the actor, Dean Stockwell and maybe BSG or Caprica but all my searches end up with dead ends. Any ideas?	What's the movie or show?

So there's was kinda a party and a girl went to a boy and told him that the wall between their flats is very thin and that she can hear him having s*x, which disturbs her. He added that he keeps hearing her watching TV very loud and she responds that she was watching the show ""S*x Paradise: Australia"". Then the boy gives the girl his number and tells her to call him if something's too loud on his side of the wall.	A thin wall I'm not sure if that was a movie or a series, I just came across a clip.

1l41wgs	exorcist guy with forearm tattoos he uses in a boss fight	So i watched this one movie on Netflix years ago around like 2022-2024 but it was most likely older release, it was set in a modern city, and the main character was this exorcist-for-hire guy with a big tattoo on both forearms that connects into a shape when he puts his arms together side by side, he takes demon possession cases over the city and i think like defeats the demons? one scene i remember is opening up in this one dim room with sunlight filtering in, while some possessed girl on bed thrashes. and the final scene i remember Is the main character fighting with this final boss spirit in a big room (something like a hospital) and like as hes jumping thru the air towards it he connects his arms together to activate his tattoo which Is like a power up, so that thing helps him defeat the final demon, it wasn't anime style just normal movie, i think one side character was a woman too, main character was pale and probably had dark hair. i searched up everywhere but couldn't find ANYTHING.	exorcist guy with forearm tattoos he uses in a boss fight So i watched this one movie on Netflix years ago around like 2022-2024 but it was most likely older release, it was set in a modern city, and the main character was this exorcist-for-hire guy with a big tattoo on both forearms that connects into a shape when he puts his arms together side by side, he takes demon possession cases over the city and i think like defeats the demons? one scene i remember is opening up in this one dim room with sunlight filtering in, while some possessed girl on bed thrashes. and the final scene i remember Is the main character fighting with this final boss spirit in a big room (something like a hospital) and like as hes jumping thru the air towards it he connects his arms together to activate his tattoo which Is like a power up, so that thing helps him defeat the final demon, it wasn't anime style just normal movie, i think one side character was a woman too, main character was pale and probably had dark hair. i searched up everywhere but couldn't find ANYTHING.

1l89f4z	Looking for an American drama movie (2000s2010s) about a boy in a trailer park, hip-hop music, and an absent but supportive father figure	Hi everyone, Im trying to find a movie I watched on Netflix around 20092013. Heres what I remember: * Its a live-action American drama, roughly 90 minutes long. * The story centers on a young boy who lives with his mother in a trailer park or similar low-income environment. * The mother is blonde or strawberry blonde, looks exhausted and gaunt, and is likely an alcoholic or drug addict. At one point, she wears a light floral dress. * The boy is musically inclined, focused on hip hop or rap, and enters a music competition or contest (not necessarily a formal talent show or rap battle). * Theres a memorable scene where a grandfather or uncle angrily yells at the boy to turn off his music (hes listening to a CD player or radio), and the device ends up being destroyed or taken away. * The boy wears a ball cap and is motivated by money. * An absent father figure, who looks like John Cena (or has a similar build/appearance), appears about one-third into the movie. He is kind and supportive, maybe a figment of the boys imagination or deceased. * The boy performs on screen at one point. * The movies tone is hopeful and inspirational. If anyone recognizes this movie or has any leads, Id really appreciate your help! Thank you!

Another part is that theyre being chased by a demon or possessed person (?) and they have to go to the family to help banish whatever is after them and they reluctantly help. Im also pretty sure she has a kid/s that are either hers or nephews or something and the womans father is also in the picture. Please tell me this wasnt a fever dream! Thanks!

I always believed it to be the first Twilight movie but now that I got around to actually watching the first Twilight. It also had a Vampire Werewolf conflict and a girl protagonist and a Vampire that was horndogging her. In the end there was some rival Vampire that wanted to kill her and they fought and managed to bite her. In this setting Vampires got to choose wether their victim died or got turned. I mostly remember the graphic end scene where they threw wodden stakes in his body and burning him to death while constantly shouting what choice he would make. And the movie ended with her surviving and becoming a Vampire. A friend of mine said that rings a bell but I cant find anything online. Anyone having an idea?

But it's about a man or boy, his family has a huge mansion. One of the climax scenes is him trying to kill a wild boar in the forest or the outskirts of the city he lives in. The movie is OLD but I believe it's in technicolor. Sorry I don't remember much. But him going home, getting a hunting gun in his family's mansion and killing the wild boar is the only thing I scarcely remember. It's a drama or family drama.	Movie from the 40/50/60's about a boy who has a conflict with his father I don't remember much of the movie. Not even sure if the conflict was the main plot or if it was really about that.

1lir872	1980s Horror VHS Artwork Help	Hi! I'm trying to remember the name of two low budget horror movies from the 1980s. All I can recall is the still images from the artwork on the back of the case. 1. The first one was an image of toy dolls coming out of the back of the head of a man. His face was clearly terrified and I think he may have had a beard. 2. The second was of a woman who was tied up to a chair in a room and was bloody on her bare arms and legs. Her face also was in shock. Definitely not Texas Chainsaw Massacare. Do any of these images sound familiar to anyone. Thank you very much for any help you can offer!	1980s Horror VHS Artwork Help Hi!

1ld55l6	Does anyone know the name of these 3 movies :? that I have been looking for for many years	1 - Possibly a thriller. A hunter takes his son with him to the forest to hunt, there were still people in the forest, a shot rang out during the hunt, all the people came to look and saw the body of a young girl. It turned out that the hunter's son had raped her and she wanted to tell him about it, maybe she was blackmailing him, I don't remember exactly, and the hunter, having learned about it, shot her to save her son from punishment. Filmed presumably in the 90s-2000s. 2 - The film is probably old, before 2000, in which I remember such an action. A group of people sneak into someone's well-fortified apartment to kill a person. They manage to do it, and drive away in a car. And then another one of this gang appeared. His task is simply to shoot off the doorbell. Maybe I messed something up, but there was definitely a scene where they shoot at the doorbell! 3 - The film seems to be about a girl who is preparing for her friend's wedding, and she is unlucky in love. I remember 4 scenes exactly: - the main character tries on a dress. The dressmaker sews it right on her and the dressmaker says that the girl has one hip higher than the other - another scene, the main character goes on a date with a guy, they spend the night together at her apartment. In the morning, he says that he wanted to make breakfast, but she only had cereal; - then the heroine meets this guy at a bar with another girl, runs outside, the guy follows her and tells her that he is not the guy she needs; - and the last scene, this is the end of the film, the heroine is riding on a lake in a boat with a guy, he says that the boat rental time is ending, and the girl allegedly accidentally throws the paddle into the lake, she and the guy kiss.

1la8mds	Movie where a woman has a conversation in hospital and there is a crying baby?	I have a distinct memory of a scene where, I thought Michelle Williams, has a conversation with a man in a hospital and there is a crying baby throughout the whole scene. I was convinced this was a scene in Brokeback Mountain but I skimmed the movie and can't seem to find it. The movie is definitely pre-2013 and it is perhaps not Michelle Williams but a similar looking woman. I remember the baby crying was so annoying that I changed the channel/turned off the movie... It was maybe towards the first half of the movie. Maybe I've invented this extra scene of Brokeback Mountain, but if it sounds familiar I'd love to hear suggestions!

Just rewatched Legally Blonde and realized it is /not/ the same movie. Really the only things I remember are that it's set mostly in a school, either high school or college, and there is a trial that takes place. The main piece of evidence ends up being red scuff marks on the floor left by the perpetrators red sneakers. It must have been a 2000's movie, maybe late 90's at the oldest but I doubt it. I think it was a comedy/drama, nothing super serious even though there is a trial and stuff. I just always see that scene about the red scuff marks in my head. I'm dyinnggg to know what movie it was.

They fight hand to hand for a bit until he lands a solid hit that stuns her, then he takes her gun from her holster and forces her to give him her car keys at gunpoint before driving off.

1ljdi59	Turns out there is something outside- major spoiler of the plot but it's all I can remember	Hello everyone ! I've been looking for a film for several months whose title, director, actors, and part of the plot completely escape me. It dates back to well before covid and is, I believe, from north america and really unknown. By advance, I'm sorry because just telling what I remember about it spoils everything... From the little I remember, it's about a dinner between friends (or family members ?) in the countryside. It's night, and there could be a monster outside. Only one man has seen it, he tries to warn the others but nobody believes him. The viewer is strongly encouraged to believe that this so-called monster is a metaphor for the unsaid and the paranoia between the characters &gt;!until, plot twist, there really is a monster. It breaks into the house and chases the characters. In my memories, it's black with four legs, big but not giant. Also, not an alien (I think ?).!&lt;	Turns out there is something outside- major spoiler of the plot but it's all I can remember Hello everyone !

1kngkhu	Where an Energy drink/soda is used by the bad guys to spread drugs to people to get addicted to	Hi, so I watched something (unsure if its a movie, tv show, anime etc&) a while ago and I fully dont remember the characters, storyline or ending, but I do remember that there was this energy drink brand that in the show was a new launch and was being heavily marketed, it kept appearing throughout the show and eventually the characters realised that the big bad was distributing some type of horrible drug that was in the drinks, that made people go crazy or something. The drinks were very popular among college kids and I think the cans were orange. This could just be a fever dream but any guesses Reddit?

1l9gpkw	Looking for a thriller movie (20172023) involving seduction, betrayal, and a disturbing twist.	Hey all, Im trying to remember the name of a Hollywood thriller I watched a while back. Its not a horror or ghost movie, but it had intense psychological and suspense elements. Heres what I remember (some details might be a bit off): The main character is a rich man with a seemingly good relationship with his wife (and maybe kids). A young, attractive woman starts working for him  maybe as an assistant or house help. Over time, she seduces him, and they end up having a secret sexual relationship, unknown to his wife. Things start to spiral when the girl becomes more demanding or obsessive. Eventually, its revealed she was manipulating him from the beginning, and it was all a plan orchestrated with her father to steal his wealth or ruin his life. Theres a scene where the main guy is tied up or restrained, and he hears disturbing moans  heavily implied (or shown?) to be the girl and her father having sex, which is meant to be psychologically torturous. At some point, the wife discovers the truth and may also get locked up. In the final act, I vaguely remember a confrontation or escape. The overall tone was dark, erotic, and disturbing, not supernatural, more like a home-invasion psychological thriller. Any idea what movie this could be?

1lhklkr	I think this movie was early 2000s-2010	It may be US or British? But a white teenage girl with amnesia is found and taken back to her hometown by someone who claims they know her (they might have claimed to be related to her). They believe she is a girl who fell off a bridge and went missing a few months before; the protagonist looks exactly like the missing girl. The missing girl was a troubled youth who had a lot of enemies in the town due to her abrasive personality and abusive behavior. The protagonist is more calm and reserved in comparison and begins making friends. She discovered she was pushed because she was a bully and was approached by a group of her victims and they pushed her over the bridge because she was taunting them. All of this gets revealed to our protagonist when one of her new ""friends"" brings her back to the bridge. Her ""friend"" actually hates her, because she was one of her past victims.

1kk7r1c	Help me find the movie	It's a movie about a Christian missionary going to Japan. I cannot remember the fine details, but I believe the protagonist (the Christian) dies at the end of natural causes. But from my understanding he was open to the concept of Shintoism. I think it's possible that he may even have accepted Shintoism on his deadbed. During the movie he exchanged many ideas with someone about both faiths. He was either a prisoner for life in Japan or he decided to stay behind. Google keeps recommending Silence to me, but I'm sure it was a different movie.

1l7bphe	Youtube short about karma between a mechanic and a woman stranded in the desert	I'm looking for a movie based on a youtube short i saw. In the clip, a woman and a male (son?) are standing with a redneck mechanic next to her car, whose radiator has a leak, so it is not driveable. She then tells the mechanic how to fix the leak with sand and tire sealant, and after the repair he wants to charge her $500. She tells him that is unchristian, and he holds up his pistol as a threat. He then says if the lord doesn't like the way he does business, to give him a sign, and immediately his entire gas station is blown down by a massive gust of wind. Do you know this movie?

Can't recall the supernatural element or even if there was one beyond the hedonistic, nocturnal lifestyles portrayed. Think Lost Boys &amp; Near Dark combined (though lower budget) with the after hours amusement park setting of the former and the gritty, 'adult themes' of the latter. Involving trailer-dwellers who ran the ferris wheel? Title was possible two words one being Moon. Lead actor was all macho, chest bearing, leather jacket, testosterone, dark haired, byronic type.

1li48aj	Can someone help me finding the name of the movie ?	Okay so couple of months ago I saw a movie clip on insta or twitter where there were a couple of women dressed in 50/60s style and if i remember correctly they were in a kitchen. I remember someone made them froze in place, they looked like they are in a movie set, told them they were not behaving like they supposed to do (not exactly but something like this) and the women looked like they are scared and in pain. I don't remember much but someone commented something like ''oh this man is controlling them to do whatever he likes to do''. I always thought it was a scene fron Don't Worry Darling but I just watched it and that scene wasnt in that movie.	Can someone help me finding the name of the movie ?

We see a normal looking man, but buff and big like Lucas Turner from Criminal Minds, suddenly approaching our protagonist? towards the barn.The big man wore jeans, maybe a red flannel shirt. And literally the only scene I remember is as he is approaching, he suddenly gets impaled through his head (specifically the eye) with a pole, he's shocked and then falls back. In this scene, we can see behind him a field, maybe corn. There might have been a bar scene before this but not too sure. Movie is set anywhere from 1980 to 1999. Must have seen it in 2012? Any clue?

1lhfoc3	Help identifying a niche early 2000s2010s low-budget animated kids movie (direct-to-DVD)  nerdy high schooler, blob monster, athletes foot spray?	Hey everyone, Im trying to track down a pretty obscure animated kids movie I watched sometime before 2016, probably early 2010s. It was definitely a low-budget, straight-to-DVD kind of film with a cartoonish style (not super polished CGI). Here are the key details I remember, with my confidence levels on each: "" Setting: High school (pretty confident) "" Protagonist: Nerdy male high school student who doesnt fit in (very confident) "" Antagonist: Jock football player bully, definitely wearing a letterman jacket (very confident) "" Plot point: The bully has athletes foot, and the nerdy protagonist is doing science experiments related to this (very confident) "" Monster: A blue, mostly limb-less blob created by a science experiment gone wrong (very confident) "" Climax: The blob monster is defeated by using athletes foot spray (very confident) "" Tone and style: Cartoon style animation, low budget (very confident) "" Movie type: Full-length kids movie, direct-to-DVD release in the U.S. (pretty confident) "" Other: I watched it sometime before 2016, probably released in the early 2000s to early 2010s (confident) The combination of athletes foot, a blob monster, and the letterman-jacket-wearing football jock bully is pretty unique, and I havent been able to find anything close despite searching a lot. It might be super niche or part of a compilation. If anyone recognizes this movie or can point me toward similar titles or obscure direct-to-DVD releases with these plot points, Id be hugely grateful! Thanks so much in advance!

1lewd6o	Looking for a movie about thrill seekers that ends with a cave diving set piece, early 2000s	In my recollection, the film is about a group of thrill seekers/extreme sports athletes obsessed with doing more and more dangerous stunts. The set up felt very much like a rip off of Point Break, but I dont remember there being a cops and robbers element. The lead character is an outsider to the group, but trying to join (cant remember why, maybe he's a journalist?) and earn their trust. What has always stuck in my mind for the last 20 years is the climax of the film. Up to this point, the two male leads have been fighting over the affections of the same girl and they make a wager to play a game of chicken. This involves them both going into an underwater cave system with no diving gear to see who can go deeper into the cave. They dive in and swim through this dark cave, occasionally finding these little pockets of air while theyre each trying to pull the other underwater. Eventually, the bad guy drowns and the good guy barely makes it back out of the cave. In my memory, it was one of the most anxiety inducing, and harrowing film climaxes Ive ever seen. I was only half-watching the movie in the background until this scene, which is why I dont remember much, but this scene sucked me right in. It was incredible. And Ive been dying to rewatch it for the last 20 years. A few other clues that might help identify the film this would have come out prior to 2007. It also didnt feel old, so it was likely early 2000s, or late 90s. I watched it in Brazil on a cable channel called Telecine Action, which would have played mostly B-action movies, but played a lot of European, Asian and Latin American films as well. I dont remember the language spoken in the film, but it was likely not an American film. Ive researched these underwater caves and I think theres a good chance the scene was set/filmed in the Cenotes in Mexico. Please help me find the name of this movie!

It also didnt feel old, so it was likely early 2000s, or late 90s. I watched it in Brazil on a cable channel called Telecine Action, which would have played mostly B-action movies, but played a lot of European, Asian and Latin American films as well. I dont remember the language spoken in the film, but it was likely not an American film. Ive researched these underwater caves and I think theres a good chance the scene was set/filmed in the Cenotes in Mexico. Please help me find the name of this movie!

1lc0cui	French film	I'm trying to remember the name of a movie I watched a while ago. all I remember is that it's set in Paris. A young girl moves there with her father and sees, from the window, another, slightly older girl arguing with her own father. The two girls eventually become friends. Later, there's a scene where the younger girl watches the older one having sex with her boyfriend while sitting on the bed next to them. It might be a French film and probably not very well known. Does anyone know what this could be?	French film I'm trying to remember the name of a movie I watched a while ago. all I remember is that it's set in Paris.

The man walks up to the woman and her teeth come out and she bites him and the camera kind of spins around as shes biting and blood squirts everywhere. She might be covering the mans body with her cape.

Flash forward to the future, Guy #1 and Girl reconnect but there's a rich Guy #2 who Girl made friends with and has a crush on, Guy #2 doesn't have a crush on her, Guy #1 does and has this whole jealousy thing with Guy #2 If I remember correctly, the movie wasn't about the romance and was more about Guy #1's jealousy.

1kifud3	Saw part of a movie when I was a kid and this one scene has been with me ever since	I can't remember exactly what the movie was about. When I saw it I would've been about 6 or 7, sometime between '86 and '88. Most likely would've been playing on HBO at the time as that was the only movie channel I know we had back then. It was either an 80s or late 70s movie The one scene I do remember that plays in my head still after all these years is like an interrogation scene. There's a woman interrogating someone at a table and there's a guy chained/tied to a wall. The woman had on a uniform that was either greenish or brown and I want to say she may have had an accent (maybe German or Eastern European of some kind). When the person at the desk wasn't giving her the answers she wanted she took her gun and pointed it at the guy on the wall. Still no answers so she shot him right in the forehead. I know it's not much to go on but if anyone out there has an idea of what this movie was I'd love to hear it. That scene has played in my head for over 30 years now and I gotta know how it ended.

Also known as Jib This may be a long shot because I dont remember much from it, but I watched a movie (I think? It could have been a show) when I was younger on Netflix, around 2012? It had anime-style characters but used real-life pictures for backgrounds. Kind of looney-toons style. I remember various scenes of dingy looking apartments and rooftops, and I remember there being some sort of shadowy blob character..? The overall feel of the movie was kind of melancholic, I think. I believe the main character was a woman.	Old Netflix anime-style movie with real life backgrounds Update: I found it with the help of my brother! Its The House 2010!!

1l8kbbg	Looking for a movie in which a man is visited by a banshee that lets him know hes dying.	I watched the movie sometime from 2000-2008, but it was older than that for sure. It was a kind of fantastical live action childrens movie. I dont remember the general overarching plot of the movie, but two kids come to stay with their elderly family member who is like a great grandfather or great uncle to the children. The kids are white American or Canadian and the great grandfather/uncle is Scottish or Irish. I only really remember a specific scene in which the man is outside his home seeing the children off as theyre about to go off on their adventure, and once they run out of frame and hes left alone, the wind starts blowing wildly in his face as he faces kind of towards the camera and a loud screeching roaring type sound can be heard, and the man starts pleading, I think asking for more time with the kids or something like that. This is the character being visited by a banshee acting as an omen of death, and I think(?) it is explicitly referred to as a banshee in the movie. The banshee is never shown to the audience, its just represented by noise and wind in the characters face. I believe the man was wearing a beige paperboy cap in the scene. I also think the old man does pass away by the end of the film but Im not sure? Please, I am begging for help finding this movie, Ive been looking for years and cannot figure out what this movie was	Looking for a movie in which a man is visited by a banshee that lets him know hes dying.

So the movie follows a couple of people in an RV (I think) they were going on a trip but they pick up a man hes short and has black hair and hes chubby. They all start to drink and black out causing them to crash the car. And they end up in the middle of no where. They get out of the RV and make it to a farm looking place and they are the only people there. Eventually they find a field full of abandoned cars, meaning this has happened many more times. Eventually they start to get killed and there are a couple of people who show up and they put their body sun a pyramid shape or something like that. Eventually there is only one woman left alive and she goes in the the attic in the house there she find a girl covered in hay. The people outside set the pyramid hay on fire with the body of the people that were in the RV.

She finds out that they actually werent in the middle of no where because she gets out and the beach is right there and there is a bunch of people on the beach and she is covered in blood. She just walks in the the water. And apparently its a cult that lures people to that location so that the could film them and make snuff films out of their deaths.

1kkebr8	Foreign film I guess?	Taking a shot here, but, I've thought about this one for so long and have never found it. I remember watching this movie on Netflix about 15-18 years ago. I had subtitles on the whole time because the movie was in French and Dutch I believe. It was about a French boy, I think he was in high school and a Dutch boy the same age. I think the French boys mother sent him to live with the dutch boys family, maybe for the summer? And during that time the two boys discovered each other and fooled around eventually. It was set in the countryside but they also might've had the ocean nearby, or a big lakeside? I don't remember much more than that, just like a gay teem summer romance/ coming of age story.

Any ideas?	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	1	21	713	735	4	136	140	0.7199999999999989	6.123333333333338	5.653633802816902	1	NA	NA	0	NA	NA	NA	0	1
1kdibtn	Horror movie from 2000s (I think)	Watched this YEARS ago so my memory is foggy but I think its about a girl in an apartment who recently broke up with her ex boyfriend and is also interested in spiritual stuff like crystals. Anyways she finds a boy under floorboards (I think) and she finds out the killer is an older guy she knows. I think shes haunted by the boy and all I know is one of the songs in the movie is spirits by the strumbellas.

They spend the day there. Then there is a cluster of helicopters that flyover and they go to follow it. I think this was an apocalyptic movie.

1ljn358	Movie about a girl who's a weaver?	I have been trying to find this movie/series that I rmemeber watching many years ago, start 2010s to mid 2010s I believe. It was this girl and her family who has this house, and the girl kept seeing this special cross like symbol everywhere. I think her grandma or someone told her about it, and later she had this thread, taht I belive was golden. The main family is her mom, dad and a brother. At the end of the movie (series?), there is a tapestry in which she had to sew the family into, I don't remember why. The end scene is just the one I remember the most. I think she used some kind of magic to sew her family into it. She doesn't have enough thread to make her and her brother. So she chooses to make her brother, who actually ends up finding the tapestry right after she has sewn it. And I think the movie ends with her parents not knowing that she even existed. Google keeps giving me this series called Evermoor on Disney+, but it just doesn't feel right. I drew the symbol to the best of my ability, from how I remember it. I honestly feel that I'm going crazy here, as if I somehow imagained this movie. Anyone I've ever spoken to about this movie, says that they haven't seen it. I'm so sorry if this sin't enough to find it. https://preview.redd.it/cjcdqhrlwx8f1.png?width=599&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b8e173e8ad5ffe4de1ab014eb193373e4ee426b	Movie about a girl who's a weaver?

1leofpa	[SCENE][Late 80s/Early 90s] Pale man in black fedora with black cane (blinking white tip) chases curly-haired teen boy	Hi all, Im trying to identify a movie I saw on TV in Turkey sometime between 1988 and 1992. I was around 5 or 6 years old, and I remember it left a big impression on me. It was likely a dubbed foreign film, not a cartoon or children's show. The scene I clearly remember: - A pale man dressed in all black, wearing a black fedora hat. - He carried a **black cane**, and **the very tip of the cane (the part that touches the ground) was blinking white**, like a small light flashing on and off. - He was **chasing a teenage boy**, probably around **1517 years old**, with **curly hair**. - In the most vivid part of the scene, the boy escapes by climbing into a **helicopter**. - As the helicopter begins to rise, the man **hooks the curved part of his cane onto the metal landing skid** of the helicopter and is **left hanging from it** as it takes off. - The mans face looked almost skeletal or skinless  very pale and creepy. As a kid, I thought he might be blind, but Im not sure if thats actually the case. It may have been a thriller, fantasy, or sci-fi movie  not a children's program. I watched it on a black-and-white TV, so color details are unclear, but the tone was dark. Ive searched for years and never found this scene again. I even had an illustration made recently based on my memory  I can attach it here in the comments if that helps. Any help would be deeply appreciated  this scene has stuck in my mind for over 30 years. Thank you!

Three men go to find a master who lives on a mountain. When they find him he jumps down off of a cliff from hundreds of feet high. He takes them up the mountain to train and at one point he kicks one of them and it seems like he rolls back down the mountain. The other two guys keep training with the master and what seems like a month or more goes by and the third guy finally shows back up and everyone seems happy to see him. I always thought it was funny because if I remember correctly the weather changed during a training montage and the guy who fell down the mountain was gone for what seemed to be months and I assume trying to climb back up the mountain. I remember the master having a long white beard looking like pai mei from Kill Bill. I cant remember what the rest of the movie was about, Hattori Hanzo MAY have been in it.

1lgqfft	Cannot recall the name of this teen romance with a twist!	The love interest was a person who never had their own body and up to every few days, would wake up in a new one. They kept finding the girl main character while inhabiting new bodies but tried not to commit to each life they were in, which was pissing her off. Near the end, they wake up in the body of a suicidal teen and save the host's life by telling her dad. Then they wake up in the body of someone they deemed would be good for the main female and arranged a meet cute and intentionally disappeared on her forever. I think they liked the dude because he was artsy and did things like put up post it notes with observations on the world. This has lived rent free in my head for years but I CANNOT remember the name!

They kept finding the girl main character while inhabiting new bodies but tried not to commit to each life they were in, which was pissing her off. Near the end, they wake up in the body of a suicidal teen and save the host's life by telling her dad. Then they wake up in the body of someone they deemed would be good for the main female and arranged a meet cute and intentionally disappeared on her forever. I think they liked the dude because he was artsy and did things like put up post it notes with observations on the world. This has lived rent free in my head for years but I CANNOT remember the name!

1l5wa8i	3 part horror movie from 70's	Low budget zombie horror (or sick people killing and eating (something like ""Cabin Fever""), from the 70s. The first 2 parts take place in a city (NY?).

Where a boat with an infected zombie drifts to New York and someone from the river police decides to investigate it and gets infected. Ending credits.

1k774ny	I can only remember one scene and its killing me.	In said scene, there is an alien emperor/general who takes a human form and walks into an office. After talking to the man in the office the alien takes his real form and is tall, greyish green? and wears like a robe, with a hat that looks like a freemason hat. He then attacks the man in the office. unfortunately I cannot for the life of me remember what the setting of the movie is. There is a chance this may have been a kids movie. the movie is from 2005-2015 for sure and its live action. the cgi of the alien is similar to the aliens from the movie Aliens in the Attic. Edit: sorry for the ambiguity, this is really all I can remember. I know it's not much but I was taking a shot in the dark that maybe someone might know whatever niche movie this is.

Basically it was about a girl early 20s or something moving back home to country side with her mom. There's a scene in the trailer where she wakes up because her bed breaks lmao. Anyways she meets a guy there and I think they fall in love? I forget what this film is called but I saw the trailer and ugndjsjc its driving me insane. I am pretty sure it was a Chinese film because it was like grassy and plains-like, I'm fairly certain it was not Japanese or Korean. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

I associate it with a scene of a house with a stain on the floor that won't go away but they could be two different films 2) a fantasy film (possibly for kids, possibly foreign and possibly older but definitely in colour) which had the feeling of Baron Munchhausen/Grimms' fairy tales and a scene in which someone (the protagonist?) had to choose between two women - his love (?) and her doppelgänger (a witch impersonating her?). They look identical but he manages to choose the right one due to some jewellery (beads of some kind) that only the real one is wearing.

They all eat together, and the elderly couple reminisces about their deceased son. They also give relationship advice. The couple/man mentions they have to leave by sunrise.

He was on the pitch among his acquaintances, and one of them bet some money that he couldnt hit the water bottle on the gate horizontal bar. He could , to everyones delight. Then that man bet even more money he couldnt hit something else on the gate, and he still won. 2. A blonde woman whose husband has been cheating on her had a crush on the coach (he was the coach of the team her son played in, I guess? Not totally sure). One day she snuck into the house and called him out of there lying in underwear. She said that she wanted so bad to get revenge on her cheating husband, then proceeded to give her opinion on the room, saying something like Didnt expect it to be so much oriental. Then she saw the photos of women in hijabi with an Arabic man and realized she mistook the house. It may be a TV show, although I tend to think it was a movie.

All I remember is a person going into a house looking for the victim and finding either a wig, or a scalp in a Sink in a very dark room. I also remember two people talking in a parking garage (I think one had glasses and was the the one responsible for the kidnapping). Both of these scenes are towards the end of the movie, with the parking garage being last, while taking place earlier in the timeline. I know this is very little to go off of.

The opening fight is an old guy with white hair and beard. Through the movie the old guys son becomes a fighter and at the end has to fight his dad. I think it was early to mid 90's.

1lefaej	NEED HELP PLEASE! Can anyone tell what movie this could be?	I remember watching this movie in 7th or 8th grade as a last day of school , everyone gets a break. The only details I remember are: 1. The movie is set between late 90s and early 2000s. 2. The whole synopsis surrounds a group of who orchestrates a heist either for diamonds or money from a rich guy's party, what looks to be set in Los Angeles. 3. On person impersonated a waiter, while there was a decoy van in place for escape. 4. The safe was like a vault with a whole security system in place equipped with a finger print biometric. The most I remember at the end was then stowing away in a laundry van and escaping with what they stole from the party. No guests from the party was robbed or disturbed, pretty much whatever was in the vault and from the host. Can anyone help me identify what film this could be, please? Adding the year, this was around 2008-2009. I edited it to the 90s to early 2000s because of the feel at that time.	NEED HELP PLEASE! Can anyone tell what movie this could be?

1ljoh1u	Recent military movie with roll call	I'm going insane trying to find the movie that contains the scene I thought was in Top Gun Maverick, but found out isn't after I just finished it. I remember the scene happening pretty early in the movie as I paused it to come back to finish it another day. A bunch of people are sitting in a sort of classroom and they're getting called up to be assigned either a warplane or a mission, I thought it was planes but my search with that in mind has been futile. The last person/people to be assigned gets something that is more impressive but challenging. The color grading and style is very similar to that of Top Gun so I would guess this is something from 2010-2025. I don't typically watch military movies so it won't be something super obscure. It's possible my mind has made all of this up but I thought I'd at least ask here before claiming insanity fully. Thank you in advance!!

1l42gsm	Japanese female cyborg movie w incest-y scenes	I thought the title was Cyborg 009, but that's a different thing. Might have had numbers in the title. EDIT: Maybe she was a special agent vs a cyborg? I don't remember what her actual job was. She definitely came from that lab: her whole life was a lie. It's at least 10 years old. There was a female cyborg or android, and I think she was in a romance with a guy who turned out to be her ""brother"", except she learned she was built and trained in a lab. There was a nursery room full of little kids toys and I guess the woman who built her was her ""mother""--there was an audio recording of her singing a lullaby in a rocking chair and we thought we'd see the mom but nothing was there. The cyborg's ""mom"" and ""brother"" had something sexual going on, I think cyborg woman got in on it later. Maybe the mom and brother weren't actually related and they were tricking the cyborg but it was still gross and incest-y. It was live-action and Japanese, I think it was either on Netflix or Crackle. Clicked it at random, thought it was based on a manga but it might have been a softcore porno and I didn't notice bc I usually fast-forward sex scenes.

Hed harvest the hair that would grow extremely quickly because of the peanut butter, and sell it for a profit. It was kinda a comedy but more of a horror movie for a young kid watching it.

1laxwqt	Looking for a mostly Spanish-language courtroom movielawyer defends long-lost brother, reunites with mother. defently a Mexican Film	Hey folks, Ive been trying to track down the name of a **Spanish-language movie** (like 98% in Spanish) that I watched on **DVD and later on cable**, probably around **20102015**. Here's what I remember about the plot: * A **young boy crosses the U.S.-Mexico border** with his father (though I think the father dies or disappearsthis may not be shown clearly). * The boy is **adopted or raised in the U.S.**, and grows up **not knowing his real family or origins**. * As an adult, he becomes a **lawyer in the U.S.**, and one of his first big court cases involves **defending someone falsely accused of murder**. * During the trial, he discovers the person hes defending is actually his **long-lost brother**. * The movie features **many courtroom scenes** (set in the U.S.), and is very emotional and dramatic. * After winning the case and **saving his brother from life in prison**, they travel to **Mexico and reunite with their mother**, which is a big emotional payoff at the end. Its **not a telenovela or TV series**definitely a movie. Most of the dialogue was in **Spanish**, but it may have had English subtitles when I saw it. It felt like a smaller or **independent film**, not a big commercial release. If anyone recognizes this, Id really appreciate the help. Its been stuck in my head for years! Thanks! P.S Movie gave similar vibes from those who made movie called ""Bajo la mismo luna"" or ""7 soles""	Looking for a mostly Spanish-language courtroom movielawyer defends long-lost brother, reunites with mother. defently a Mexican Film Hey folks, Ive been trying to track down the name of a **Spanish-language movie** (like 98% in Spanish) that I watched on **DVD and later on cable**, probably around **20102015**.

So all I can remember is: - Im sorry!! multiple times, with a persons name mixed in - the person doing the shouting is male. Theyre shouting in anguish, like theyve just done something terrible and now see themselves as a monster - the person theyre shouting for has turned away and is leaving - the scene is super dramatic. Like the shouts of IM SORRY!! are echoing. And I dont know if theres thunder and heavy rain in the scene, but it feels right.	*Name*, Im sorry! *NAME*! IM SORRY!!!

From his words, we learn that he built this park specifically to make children cry. After that, he presses a button, and the toy flies apart in the boy's hands. He tries to explain that he wasn't the one who broke the toy, but his parents don't believe him. Offended, the boy runs away, runs past warning signs (something like ""Construction site"", ""Turn back"", ""Oh no"", ""Too late"", ""Enjoy your flight"") and falls into the underworld. There he meets a group of creatures (smurfs?) who help him return to the surface. I especially remember a fragment where one of the characters ends up in a local prison, where prisoners must sing for some jabba-like monster until they go insane.

1kbqde3	Movie with jungle of feral children	Vinyan (2008) This husband and wife lose their child on vacation maybe? Some time later the mother sees a video on the news and swears that she sees her kid in the background on this tropical or jungle area, the husband is unsure. The mother gets a ticket and goes there finds a large group of orphan/feral children and becomes the group mother. Her husband eventually comes and the children kill him. I believe she stays behind to live with the kids. I probably missed some details, but I saw this a long time ago and fell asleep. I didnt like the movie, but just wanted to remember the name. I probably saw it in 2008-2009 so it came out before then.	Movie with jungle of feral children Vinyan (2008) This husband and wife lose their child on vacation maybe?

1lduk41	Movie from late 90s early 2000s about a hitman	Looking for a movie where two cops (one white and one black) try to chase down a professional hitman. What I remember is there was one scene where he and a woman are in a hotel room where he kills her by smothering her with a pillow. At the end of the movie he is holding someone hostage with a gun he had put in a stash somewhere, but the cops found it beforehand and filed down the firing pin so he couldnt use it. He also had a unique ring they used to identify him with on cctv. Thats all I can remember. Was probably over 20 years ago since saw it, But it pops up in my head from time to time. Anyone know what movie Im talking about? Thanks	Movie from late 90s early 2000s about a hitman Looking for a movie where two cops (one white and one black) try to chase down a professional hitman.

1l6x0g9	Sci-fi Movie with special pod, alien abduction and idyllic neighborhood?	I watched a movie a while ago that I now cannot remember the name of for the life of me. Hoping that maybe someone will know what Im talking about. Heres what I can remember: Its set in a modern and futuristic neighborhood/world, with high tech aspects. There is some overarching government or something that gives everyone a special pod that opens at a specific time. I think it has some sort of creature in it maybe? The neighborhood was seemingly perfect? The women dont work and there was a scene where two women meet up at a house to talk about the pods. The main woman gets suspicious of the pod and tries to destroy it or open it early I think? This may have been a different movie, but I think the woman gets abducted during the night and other times and she realizes it because she loses chunks of time. She ties herself to the bed to prevent herself from being pulled out the window. Hope somebody knows what Im thinking of! It was probably an indie film or non-mainstream. Definitely newer, probably released within the past 10 years. TIA!	Sci-fi Movie with special pod, alien abduction and idyllic neighborhood?

1l8z173	Help needed finding Chinese Thriller/Horror movie	Hello, A couple years ago, on a domestic flight to Texas, I saw a Chinese horror/thriller movie. It followed an employee from an insurance company or similar, who was sent to investigate a claim made by a poor family. He ends up discovering that the a member of the family, specifically the daughter, was a murderer, hence the insurance claim on a murdered family member. It wasn't the most high quality movie ever, but it was pretty interesting. A couple scenes I remember: * The first scene included a young boy dressed in white jumping off of a building. * The protagonist had a dream where his pet mantis grew giant and attacked him. The scene had a CGI mantis that was pretty low quality lmao. * The protagonist was working with an older cop/detective * The cover image had red text I've even asked AI, but still no answer. Its not Black House (2007), Control (2013), or Presumed Accidents.

1kun92d	A movie I saw on TV around 2008	Im looking for a horror movie or show where a teenage boy is hanging out on his bed in his bedroom when he gets tied to a bedpost while little hooded creatures that look like monks come out from under the bed in a straight line as he screams and there are a lot of them. There is a woman downstairs reading a book who I think could hear the commotion going on upstairs. Its not Dont Be Afraid of the Dark 1973 or 2010 and its not The Boogey Man 1980. I saw it on TV around 2008. I remember my mom had it on (she changed the channel quickly after that scene) and it scared the crap out of me. Sorry its so vague but I only saw this one scene.

A guy movies to a small town, but its more of a collection of trailers and mobiles homes. Its a very gloomy and erie atmosphere and the residents are all pretty weird. There is this one guy who is a creepy doctor. The main character moves here to collect data for work or get material for a book (idk) and by the end of the movie we find out he is a patient in a mental hospital (NOT SHUTTER ISLAND). Aditionaly he may have moved there with his wife and there might have been a scene with a barbeque.	I can remember small details and the ending (spoilers I guess?)

1k7fr1o	Thriller/ Suspense	I think the movie came out between 2000 and 2010. At the begining of the movie, a woman is attacked, and I think SAed. The attacker is unknown and they never find out who did it. Then it cuts to a little further ahead, and the woman and her husband are taking a trip to a secluded house. She has been suffering from anxiety since the attack so this trip is to help her get away and feel safe. The home is very upscale, plenty expensive. Its not some rustic cabin in the woods. Its clear this couple is well to do. Another woman shows up. And this is where some of my memory is hazy. The second woman might have been running from something. They take her in for a bit. I think the second woman starts to flirt with the husband. Its possible the second woman was the attacker. Its also possible the husband was. This is all I can really remember.

But im like 90% sure she grabbed some pills and then closed it and we saw her reflection?? I might be making this whole idea up but I SWEAR I remember it!! any ideas?

1led5tv	A story in Apollo 13 reminds me of another movie, maybe.	In Apollo 13, there is a scene where they play an old interview of Tom Hank's character, where he's talking about an incident he had flying a plane that began to malfunction, and in the end when he'd lost hope after the lights on the plane went out, he managed to see where he needed to land due to the glow of algae that was churned up in the wake of an aircraft carrier. Whenever I have see this ""You never know what events will transpire to get you home"" scene, it just seems extremely familiar and I am 90% sure it's because I have seen a separate movie that is entirely about that flight. Like, I remember watching that scene where his lights go out and you assume he is done for, but then he follows the glow to safety. But I have tried searching and can't find any reference to it, so i'm almost at a point of giving up and assuming I imagined seeing it separately. And there is one tiny twist that makes me even less sure about the whole thing, and it's that I feel like that movie I watched also had a Bermuda Triangle theme which contributed to the plane's issues. Now, that twist could be me remembering two separate (but similar) plane movies and melding them together in my head, or that the producers telling the *true* story of that algae flight 'took liberties' to make it more interesting by throwing in the Bermuda Triangle mystery and how it effects planes. Or i'm just misremembering entirely and there was no Bermuda Triangle theme. All three are possible. If this movie exists and I did infact see it,, it would have been mid 80's when I was only a few years old, so that's why I have nothing specific to offer in the way of details. Just an ""I am sure a movie exists about that event and i'm sure I have seen it"". It will obviously be great if someone knows of and names the movie,,, but I would love to hear from people if they have seen it, what they remember of it etc to help jog my memory, before I start to hunt down copies of old movies to check if any suggestions are the movie i'm remembering. Cheers all!	A story in Apollo 13 reminds me of another movie, maybe.

As in the headline, I remember it as a live action movie that felt like an anime, with kind of a computer graphic look. There were a lot of fighting and action, and I think the protagonist was trying to protect a girl or something. In one scene I think he ran up the wall of a giant building. Maybe a scene with a floating island. The setting was kinda mech dystopia.

1kgmd4t	Sisters murder abuser	I've tried Google with no luck, The movie starts with two sister, one of whom is in an abusive relationship. The abuser gets killed by one (or both) of the women. They hide the murder by wrapping him in a shower curtain (I'm thinking one of those stereotypical fish ones) and dumping his body into some water. Some time passes and a cop starts investigating the missing person with the two women being prime suspects. But the cop and one of the sisters have a connection and start falling in love. But wait! the abuser isn't really dead. The shower curtain shows up - I think plastered against a large window. Then he reappears saying something about being really good at holding his breath, that's why he didn't drown when they threw him in the water. And that's all I remember. I'm 90% sure it was before 2008 and it was probably on TV as we didn't rent movies very often. Most likely Syfy or Lifetime as my family watched those a lot.

1l7nhl8	Horror movie with cemetery (?) chase scene, nudity, 1980s or 1990s	I saw this movie when I was a kid. The scene that stuck with me involved a woman being chased by a killer. I believe she was being chased through a cemetery, though I'm not positive. It was definitely outdoors and foggy. She either trips and falls or is knocked down and while laying on her back breathing, the killer rips her top open, exposing one breast. Maybe TMI, but I distinctly remember the way it jiggled because I thought breasts were firm up until that point in my life. I would say it was a low budget B-movie, likely 1980s or early 1990s. I thought it may have been one of the Phantasm movies, but if it was, I haven't found the scene. Would love some help!	Horror movie with cemetery (?) chase scene, nudity, 1980s or 1990s I saw this movie when I was a kid. The scene that stuck with me involved a woman being chased by a killer. I believe she was being chased through a cemetery, though I'm not positive. It was definitely outdoors and foggy. She either trips and falls or is knocked down and while laying on her back breathing, the killer rips her top open, exposing one breast.

1le8qbr	A movie about a hand	I think it was a children's movie, but I don't remember much about it. It followed a severed hand, as it travelled through what seemed to be a city. The only scene I distinctly remember was in a subway. The hand had found a lighter, and sparked it up, attracting rats. Then, the rats began to bite at the hand. Any help is greatly appreciated, thanks!	A movie about a hand I think it was a children's movie, but I don't remember much about it.

1ljfob9	Animated movie I can't remember	It was most likely released in the 2000' I can only remember one scene, it had a guy peeing in cup for a sort of drug test for see if he was using any ""steroids"" (it was a kids movie so they most likely didn't use this phrasing). The guy couldn't pee without his dad doing a pspsps sound to encourage the peeing. He was some sort of fighter I think, like a viking maybe. The movie was animated in the style of how to train your dragon I think.

But one of the vehicles (the antagonist) ended up getting stuck between the walls on the left and right, the other vehicle (protagonist) pushed his car onto the driver door and shoved him out at the end of the hallway. At the end, the antagonist car flung up in the air while our protagonist drives out under. I remember its fasts streets cars drifting and it wasnt in years 2020+.

1kgk317	Looking for Blonde Woman in Metallic Exit Stairs (2006-2010)	I remember watching this movie around 2006-2008 (maybe between 2005-2010), on French TV late at night (between 10 PM and 3 AM). However, the film might have been older, as French TV often airs films with a delay * **Main character:** A blonde woman with a somewhat wide face. * **Scene:** She and a man are running/fleeing through a large, modern industrial building, similar to the World Trade Center. It has metallic stairs (likely emergency exit stairs). During the scene, the woman falls to the ground, and there's a close-up shot of her face from above. * **Setting:** The scene takes place in a **metallic, industrial stairwell** inside a large building. It was not an outdoor chase. * **Timeframe:** The movie would have been aired around 2006-2010 on French TV, and it seems to be from that era, not too old or too new. **Additional Info:** * Ive already checked all of Scarlett Johanssons films, and its not one of those. * I also checked the *Resident Evil* films, and there is a scene in *Resident Evil: Apocalypse* where a woman falls down, but its not the one Im looking for. The scene I remember takes place in an **exit stairwell** inside a large building (like the World Trade Center), and it doesnt quite match the *Resident Evil* films.

1l7tt4h	Movie or show where a a group of space pirates/mercenaries/criminals board and raid a luxury ship.	Not to confuse anyone who are already thinking of the movie ""The Fifth Element"" but I remember vague scenes from this movie or series (based off both the style and cinematography, it looked like it ranged between the mid 90s - early 2000s) where one clip starts of with a woman with short hair wearing a blue dress and conversing with a male individual when the scene jumps to the space pirates or mercs or criminals (I absolutely have no idea) who board and raid the ship with the woman on screen. Another scene from this is where a large ship is seen by the group of space thugs from a monitor as it looks as if it is chasing the ship with one stating something like ""We can't go against something like that,"" following by a scene jump to the same woman - short hair, blue dress - as she states to them that ""they're coming to get you..."" before one of the mercs draws their weapon and shoots her in the chest as she falls to the ground. The final scene jump is where the massive ship that was going after both the mercs and luxury ship prepares to board it with the last scene or two in a now darkened room as the scene is hovering below the deceased woman and one where the mercs emerge with their hands up.

1lhzxuq	Weird Netflix Wolf Movie	One time I watched this weird netflix movie, Id like to say roughly 2017-2019. I remember this one scene vividly, in which these strange rainbow jackal-esq creatures started capturing all the villagers in the protagonist's village. It was in like a dark forest and the creatures were putting the villagers in these little wheeled cages. During the movie, the protagonist either became a wolf or had one as a side kick. I remember one of the gimmicks being that the villain dude (I think he was also a wolf, in control of the little jackal guys) had like green eyes, and the protagist had blue eyes. The movie kinda reminded me of the movie ""Mune"" but, that wasnt it. It at least had 3d animation if I remember right. I cannot find this movie for the life of me and I dont know if I dreamed this or if its an actual thing.

1l5953f	Teen Movie about a alien girl who befriends a teenage girl.	Hello! First time posting, so sorry for any formatting issues. Time to take my manhunt for this movie to reddit because I cant keep going crazy searching for it when I remember it once a year anymore! I watched this movie around 2010 to the best of my memory (I was decently young). It randomly played on my TV one afternoon (random Canadian basic TV package. All I remember from the film was that it had one human girl and another alien girl who become friends over what might have been the summer or a break (I do not remember school being prominent). The alien girl keeps her background/identity a secret throughout the film which is later revealed at the end. There is a scene later in the movie where the alien girl gets pushed off of a dock (maybe from bullies?) and starts to drown. Someone (her friend I think) saves her and she leaves. later the best friend character shows up at the alien girls house and they (parent/guardian) tell her that she cant talk/come to the door because she's ""sick"" or something. After this point I forget almost everything until that last scene where her classic disc looking spaceship comes to pick her up. I am not sure if she moved or needed to go home to get better or if she comes back, but I remember a shot of the ship over their house at night. I have searched for YEARS! Lightning point is often brought to my attention but I remember this being a movie and not a series. I might just have to watch it to make sure though haha! Other than that, any searches I have made for this film haven't matched and/or I couldn't find the dock scene which is most prominent in my memory. The whole movie gave Aquamarine vibes (teen rating sort of feeling) but it was 100% about aliens. I do not think it was new when I saw it, and more like a re-run on a random channel me and my sibling stumbled upon. I know memory is fickle, and can be wrong at times so I don't have much hope but I figured it is worth a shot! Thank you! &lt;3	Teen Movie about a alien girl who befriends a teenage girl. Hello!

1lise7v	old movie from 2000s	there is a scene of a little girl pretending to take the pills for epilepsy given by her mother but in reality she hides them in a grandfather clock and then due to an epileptic seizure she falls down the spiral staircase of her house. later we go to think through a drawing that the mother had pushed her down but the drawing had to be turned revealing that in reality the mother was trying to save her. in addition in another moment of the film we see a girl who is locked in a closet in the basement of her school and when after many years the door is reopened by a girl who had visions of this girl you can see the blood and pieces of nail on the door from the inside because the girl had tried to scrape the door and the wall. still another scene is a moment outdoors in which a woman thinks she sees a child (I assume it was the son/daughter) but in reality it was not him/her. I vaguely remember a scene in a barn and also the film is old. thanks in advance! p.s.: I'm unsure about the last two scenes I wrote and I hope I'm not putting in extra scenes that aren't part of the movie so I ask you to focus on the first two scenes (little girl and basement) which are the ones I remember best.	old movie from 2000s there is a scene of a little girl pretending to take the pills for epilepsy given by her mother but in reality she hides them in a grandfather clock and then due to an epileptic seizure she falls down the spiral staircase of her house. later we go to think through a drawing that the mother had pushed her down but the drawing had to be turned revealing that in reality the mother was trying to save her. in addition in another moment of the film we see a girl who is locked in a closet in the basement of her school and when after many years the door is reopened by a girl who had visions of this girl you can see the blood and pieces of nail on the door from the inside because the girl had tried to scrape the door and the wall. still another scene is a moment outdoors in which a woman thinks she sees a child (I assume it was the son/daughter) but in reality it was not him/her.

1l9znwc	Arthouse Film, 2012-2016, Family Drama	I am madly trying to recall the name of a movie I watched in an arthouse theater between the years 2012-2016. It is entirely shot in a house, and stylistically perhaps close to Wes Anderson, but I recall it being more tense than silly (not a thriller though). The storyline is of a young woman who grows up with a crazy mother, is developmentally disabled (perceived, not actually stated at any time). Gets married, has a baby, baby creates a whole new dynamic in the relationship because she can't handle it. The cast was all white, perhaps Eastern European of some kind - definitely not Latin American of any kind. Memorable line (husband to the wife): ""Look! I made your favorite! - food!"" Help?

It is entirely shot in a house, and stylistically perhaps close to Wes Anderson, but I recall it being more tense than silly (not a thriller though). The storyline is of a young woman who grows up with a crazy mother, is developmentally disabled (perceived, not actually stated at any time). Gets married, has a baby, baby creates a whole new dynamic in the relationship because she can't handle it. The cast was all white, perhaps Eastern European of some kind - definitely not Latin American of any kind. Memorable line (husband to the wife): ""Look! I made your favorite! - food!"" Help?

1kdgsi7	Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart esque movie rip-off i watched with my dad	The movie starts with a boy on the other side of a prison and he is talking to his dad who is lock up because the dad is accused of being mad/crazy. After that i dont remember much because i think i sept half way through the movie, still im not sure cause i was too young to remember but what I remember is the same boy getting rolled into a snow ball, then the boy finding a small house and a girl welcoming him in. When they both walked in the home the interior of the house was big and the girl saying something like it looks much bigger in the inside. The reason why i said it was like Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart movie was because it had the same aesthetics, though a little darker. The characters had big heads and small/ skinny bodies, except for the adults having normal proportions. I am so sorry for the vague description but this is honestly just what I remember, i would ask my dad but he died in early 2021.

1lje66q	Does anyone know the name of these 3 movies :? that I have been looking for for many years	1 - Possibly a thriller. A hunter takes his son with him to the forest to hunt, there were still people in the forest, a shot rang out during the hunt, all the people came to look and saw the body of a young girl. It turned out that the hunter's son had raped her and she wanted to tell him about it, maybe she was blackmailing him, I don't remember exactly, and the hunter, having learned about it, shot her to save her son from punishment. Filmed presumably in the 90s-2000s. 2 - The film is probably old, before 2000, in which I remember such an action. A group of people sneak into someone's well-fortified apartment to kill a person. They manage to do it, and drive away in a car. And then another one of this gang appeared. His task is simply to shoot off the doorbell. Maybe I messed something up, but there was definitely a scene where they shoot at the doorbell! 3 - The film seems to be about a girl who is preparing for her friend's wedding, and she is unlucky in love. I remember 4 scenes exactly: - the main character tries on a dress. The dressmaker sews it right on her and the dressmaker says that the girl has one hip higher than the other - another scene, the main character goes on a date with a guy, they spend the night together at her apartment. In the morning, he says that he wanted to make breakfast, but she only had cereal; - then the heroine meets this guy at a bar with another girl, runs outside, the guy follows her and tells her that he is not the guy she needs; - and the last scene, this is the end of the film, the heroine is riding on a lake in a boat with a guy, he says that the boat rental time is ending, and the girl allegedly accidentally throws the paddle into the lake, she and the guy kiss.

But what I remember vividly was how brutal it was, you know when you get scenes where you see someone shoot a gun and someone gets hit in the same shot. Lots of innocents get killed.

1l6qhzc	Looking for an old Japanese or Asian martial arts movie with brutal fight scenes and a temple setting	Hi everyone, Ive been trying to remember the name of a martial arts movie I watched a long time ago when I was a kid. I think it was Japanese or possibly Chinese/Hong Kong  definitely Asian  and probably made in the 80s or 90s. Heres what I remember: The main character gets brutally beaten by another fighter in a really extreme and unforgettable scene. I clearly remember that during this beating, the villain punches the ground so hard that it creates a hole or cracks in the floor, and the heros head ends up inside that hole while lying down  and he keeps getting punched. After this scene, the hero is found by two other people (maybe monks or martial artists?) who save him and help him recover. They then teach him martial arts or train him intensely. After his training, the hero becomes very strong and starts defeating a lot of people. I vaguely remember that the setting of the movie had something to do with a temple or monastery, especially the place where the brutal beating happened. The overall color tone of the film was kind of yellow-ish or had a warm, golden tint  not super clean or modern looking. It wasnt comedic or fantasy like Kung Fu Hustle  it had a very serious and brutal tone. This movie has stuck in my mind for years, especially because of that intense scene where the guys head is in the floor crack, getting beaten. Ive tried searching online, but no luck so far. Does anyone recognize this movie? Thanks a lot!

1l7wjtd	Movie where the serving staff of a big White House bleed pastel colors-NOT PHANTASM	Hello, all. I have been following this sub for a while and finally decided to make a post. I am looking for a movie I watched with my father when I was very small (circa 1993-1994). It was a VHS dad had rented so it could be much older. So, let me preface this by saying that I have watched the fingers scene and the rest of Phantasm many times, and it is not what Im talking about. (I do love Phantasm though.) I honestly feel crazy, I have never met anyone who has ever watched this movie. I remember once, a long time ago (circa 2009-2010) I found a Yahoo answers post of a guy asking the exact same question, and also saying he feels like hes crazy = but that question has long since disappeared off the internet. The movie begins with two people making out in a graveyard overlooked by a big White House. (This is why I thought it might be Phantasm, until I rewatched it.) The only other thing I remember is a couple running through the mansion, and being chased by the staff (maids, butler). Everything in every room of the house was solid white. When they would attack the maids and butler, they would bleed pastel colors like blue, green or yellow. It was a thick pastel liquid. It looked different than the Phantasm fingers scene. I know its a long stretch and it could have been a cheap B movie that never made it mainstream or even at this point, something my brain has scrambled in memory. I have always thought about it though and for years after my parents divorce I would ask Dad about it and he remembered it but could never remember the name. My dad passed away two years ago. Two of his biggest loves were AC/DC and horror movies. Back before he and mother split up, he would wake me up after she went to bed and we would watch horror movies together. Including this one. Those are some of my favorite memories. I would love if I could find this movie and rewatch it. You guys are experts though and if you tell me it doesnt exist, Ill accept my mis-remembrance and go on about my life ===	Movie where the serving staff of a big White House bleed pastel colors-NOT PHANTASM Hello, all.

It was about a well-dressed man jumping the rotor blade's shadows of a wind turbine, as he seemed really bored. It was a green and sunny scenary. It was aired mid 00's. Can't remember much more since I turn it off because my family was about to leave the house for vacation. For curiosity's sake, any more information is appreciated.

I don't know if it's a movie or a TV show, but this kinda fat bearded guy is pushing a pig (which is called Captain or Commando) in what looks like a baby carriage, but then a bunch of ninjas jump out and start fighting him. The guy starts fighting the ninjas and it keeps cutting to the pig watching the fight, *but then* they reveal a panel of button's inside the pigs carriage and *the pig* presses a button that shoots out a metal staff and the fat guy guy does a bunch of stunts with the staff. Then the pig hits another button and like, *guns* pop out of the carriage and take out the ninjas. At the end they've beaten all the ninjas and the guy says ""Well, come on Captain, let's go"".

One of the teachers of the school becomes obsessed? likes? the main girls friend and theres this scene in my head where the teacher gifts flowers to this friend. And the main character confused about what was happening. Any help appreciated.	Residential schooling Hi everybody, Hoping someone can help me with this one thats been bothering me for some time.

He then takes off his belt and puts it around the driver's neck to make the driver bring the bus to a halt. The young man then gets off the bus and runs away while all the other young recruits cheer.

1l8800z	Indian movie about reincarnation, people sing and an older sister gets naked in front of her brother	Hi, I found this movie some time ago, but for the life of me I can't find it anymore. It's an old Indian movie I believe from the 50s, but maybe slightly more recent, surely not past the 80s. From what I can scarcely remember about the plot there's the womanizer that at a certain points sees his sister getting naked in front of him, changing his perspective on life and becoming a really religious man. In the meanwhile, the movie talks about some reincarnation(s) of, I believe, Vishnu. In a scene an (ill?) kid dies, but then reincarnates and comforts his parents. People sing a lot in this movie.

From what I can scarcely remember about the plot there's the womanizer that at a certain points sees his sister getting naked in front of him, changing his perspective on life and becoming a really religious man. In the meanwhile, the movie talks about some reincarnation(s) of, I believe, Vishnu. In a scene an (ill?) kid dies, but then reincarnates and comforts his parents. People sing a lot in this movie.

1ld05p8	1980s Movie featuring the 100-foot limousine	Been trying to find the name of the 1980's b-movie. It features the 100-foot limousine made by Jay Ohrberg. The car was used as a moving base for the bad guys, made up of little people, and there was even a mini limousine that would deploy from it. The good guy, IIRC was driving a Lamborghini Countach kit car.

I saw it on VHS as a child, left a strong enough imprint to look for it in my 40s.	1980s Movie featuring the 100-foot limousine Been trying to find the name of the 1980's b-movie.

1ko40bq	60s-ish Alien Invasion Movie	I saw a segment of a movie about 20 years ago with green or greyish some humanoid alien-type creatures arriving on Earth. I believe they were at least somewhat antagonistic. All I remember from the dialogue is one of the aliens responding to a human ultimatum or query ""I will consider"" in a monotone nasal voice. I mostly remember it because my friends and I who were watching it repeated this line to each other for years. But I have never had any luck at finding the name of the movie.	60s-ish Alien Invasion Movie I saw a segment of a movie about 20 years ago with green or greyish some humanoid alien-type creatures arriving on Earth.

It was sci fi and the main character was this Dad and the bad guys were these figures with like TV screens for faces showing weird distorted faces?? I think they were trying to kidnap his kids at some point?? I also remember the colors beings really washed out during certain points.

1k6qrxl	(Fittingly) Vague recollection of amnesia film	I seek the title of a film with an amnesia or perhaps simple deception component. Might have been up to 35+ years since I saw it ... At any rate, I recall a plot something like this: a man is travelling to help / meet a woman under stressful circumstances but doesn't meet her (i.e. it doesn't work out / she's not there / whatever) and he ends up absolutely distraught, wondering whether he's gone mad, fabricated her, etc. This is so vague a memory of mine it might be false / a dream, etc., but it has the feeling of one of those high-impact real events (i.e. a film watched IRL), so I'm tending towards that. Again, embarrassing if fabricated by my brain, or alternatively, obvious, but I recall the character stumbling around at the conclusion, absolutely bereft, confused (on a beach?). I think that's how it ends, and it really depressed me! I think it was quite well made - not some random B-movie. American. That's alls I gots, folks. Thanks!

1l9qk0v	Spanish language movie about a man who decided to kill his three girlfriends	Hi I've been trying to find a movie that I remember watching in Spanish class a long time ago, but cannot remember what its called. It is a Spanish language Black Comedy movie about a man who simultaneously dates 3 women because he takes pity on them for various reasons. When he finally finds someone he truly loves he decided to kill the others reasoning that they would feel to sad if they where left alone after their breakup. I don't remember when it was from, but I remember us watching it in around 2004 so its definitely an older movie, either late 90's or early 2000's.

1leymbe	Locked in a horse arena until they figure out a money laundering scheme	Hi All, I am watching the accountant 2 and a random memory of a movie/show popped into my head but I can't remember the name or actors. The scene is where a main character with impressive skills in money laundering/mob accounting goes to a new client who brings him to an indoor horse arena and gives him a test to create a money laundering scheme. The client puts the pressure on the main character by brutally murdering a random person in front of him to show him what happens if he doesn't perform to expectations. The client then locks him in the horse arena until he solves the test given to him. At first I thought it was the first accountant movie, but after searching google/YouTube I haven't been able to find any scene similar to what I described and I remember watching this described scene within the past 4-5 years so its more recent than the first accountant movie. Thanks in advance.

1l1yq4f	[TOMT][Movie][2000s?] A boy in a girls camp gets stamps for breaking rules  after 3 something bad happens	I watched this film as a kid, around 20132015, probably on Belarusian TV. I was about 5 then, and I cant get it out of my head. Ive been trying to find it ever since. Heres what I remember: - It was a live-action film, not a series, and not a play. Pretty sure it was a standalone movie. - It mightve been black and white  or stylized like that. - It was definitely not a Soviet film  it was very well-made, serious, and professional in style. - The setting was some kind of camp or institution, with only girls working: cleaning, laundry, chores, etc. - A boy ends up there somehow. He was about 12. He had to follow the same strict rules as the girls. - Whenever he broke a rule, hed get a stamp (not a tattoo) on his wrist or near his hand. - When he got his third stamp, a girl said something like thats it, youre done or youre screwed now. - I think there was a curfew he violated  I remember him sneaking out at night. - The film had a cold, strict atmosphere. Almost dystopian, or psychological. But I dont remember anything supernatural or fantasy-like. Thats all I remember. Ive searched and searched, but no luck. If anyone has even a vague idea of what this might be  Id be incredibly grateful. Thanks in advance.

1k60b1z	Horror Movie from awhile ago	Im desperate now. Ive tried googling, ChatGPT, IMDB advanced search and nothing comes up. I could also have some details wrong about this movie and be mixing it up with other movies cause I watched it in like 2017/2018. So if anything sounds familiar just shout it out. This horror movie has two girls as the main characters there's a big age difference. The youngest sister finds a diary in her new attic bedroom and it's from the previous occupant of the room. The diary is from a girl who was bullied a lot and died. Turns out that girl possess the diary and ends up possessing the little girl. There's a flash back scene at one point in the movie that shows how the girl died I think a bunch of kids from the high school attacked her or her boyfriend. Another scene which is towards the end has the older sister and her kinda boyfriend who I think killed the girl fighting the ghost possessing her little sister. The fight scene takes place in the attic bedroom. Theres a lot of stuff levitating and being thrown around and a big flash. This was kinda like a b movie and it was made somewhere in between 2000 and 2019. I'm thinking it was more between 2000-2010 just because of the jeans and clothes. The actors spoke English.

1lju9uq	Looking for the title of an indie post-apocalyptic film (20092018)	Hoping someone can help me identify this film I watched years ago. Id guess it was released sometime between 2009 and 2018. Its an indie film set in a post-apocalyptic world, but its not about the apocalypse itselfmore of a slow, character-driven story. It follows a group of friends living together in a house in upstate New York (?) after society has collapsed. They live off the land and try to survive, and the film focuses more on their interpersonal dynamics. Some key details I remember: "" One man takes on a leader role and sleeps with two of the women, creating tension in the group. "" A few people die, possibly from something like botulism and maybe a hunting accident. "" The final scene features someone playing a piano in the house.

1kq57nz	A disaster movie. I remember nothing else.	When i was a kid i saw a movie. I don't remember properly what it was about, but probably a disaster movie. There was a scene when a bunch of people in hazmat suit are investigating a room, and there is a computer where a dead woman is blocking the computers solar cell, and they move her, and the computer starts playing some video. Or something like that. And the womans body was turned really dry. Almost as if it was turn to sand but was still holding together. One of the lead actors looked a bit like the lead of the Odyssey mini series, or kinda like an older Bruce Willis with hair. Idek. Edit: I think it probably played during the 1990-2010s. Edit 2: I actually found it after years omg https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Beach_(2000_film). It suddenly hit me that the actor from Odyssey looked similar. Turns out he was literally in it!

1lgcvob	Mid2000s (possibly made for TV) about a high schooler who gets involved in demonic worship/dark magic.	Ok, this is driving me insane but also I only have vague memories of watching it at a friends house 20 years ago but I think it was a made for tv movie (possibly ABC/Fox family, somewhere between 2003-2005) about a goth/alternative high schooler who gets involved in dark magic so picture pentagrams on the school gym floor and so on and then something goes wrong and he might get possessed? I THINK the last scene is that hes shed the goth/alternative image.

1kfd98c	2 girls in kitten masks	I watched this movie on Netflix from around 2016-2019 (I just remember I was a teenager). But basically the movie was about a girl who moves to a new school and meets this girl. They become best friends and the main character starts to develops feelings for the girl she meets. Theres a scene where they are giving each other stick n poke tattoos when the main character discovers a kitten masks. The other girl shows her what these masks are for. Basically she likes to go live on websites wearing this kitten masks doing provocative/sexual acts for money. They start to sorta work together and perform acts on each other for their audience on this website. The second girl comes up with this idea of both girls meeting up with one of their viewers for money, but instead of actually go through with the acts they would blackmail the creep threatening to tell his family about everything so he would still pay them. This specific creep lies about being wealthy. My memory gets blurry around this point which is why im trying to find this movie. I dont remember exactly what happened on if he paid them off or what exactly but the second girl ends up telling his family anyways. This guy seeing how he lost everything because Im pretty sure his wife leaves him since he was trying to hook up with 2 underage girls. The guy ends up going after these 2 girls and theres specifically a scene of him chasing them through a convenient store with a gun. And the main character gets shot. Thats all I can remember from the movie but it seems like its been wiped from the internet. I remember it being a really good movie though so please help me find it !	2 girls in kitten masks I watched this movie on Netflix from around 2016-2019 (I just remember I was a teenager).

That then changes shape a number of times to a fluttering butterfly, I think a flower at one point, and other shapes, and morphs between the different shapes only as cartoons can. No dialog, just music. I think it's 60s, maybe 70s. This was on after whatever movie, late night (...I think it ended tge broadcast day for one viewing...yes, that ling sgo...) and I think the station used it to fill time. Only about 1-2 minutes long.

1lhqmf1	Looking for a witch movie (before 2016) with a specific salt-counting scene	Hi everyone, I watched a witch-themed movie many years ago (definitely before 2016), and I only remember one particular scene that stuck with me: A witch is about to attack someone, and the victim grabs a salt shaker and throws salt into the air. According to folklore, witches are supposed to stop and count every grain of salt. But instead of being slowed down, this witch starts counting the grains at an impossibly fast speed, following the salt through the air as it falls, counting each grain until the last one mid-motion. It was a really eerie and supernatural moment. Ive been trying to find this movie for years. Its some kind of action/fantasy/horror movie involving witches, but I dont remember the title or actors. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!

1le8sf6	Movie where woman is ran off the road and her daughter is taken.	Ok, so everything I search says this movie doesn't exist. It was a long time ago when I watched it and didn't get to see it all the way through and would like to rewatch it. It was an early to mid 90's flick (possibly a made for tv one) and involved an incident where a lady was driving with her young daughter in the car and was ran off the road down a hill, if I remember right. Said lady was unconscious and the individuals that ran her off the road were a couple that wanted a child and decided to kidnap the lady's daughter (reason for running her off the road). The couple rush to the vehicle and I believe the woman takes the little girl while the man douses the lady in alcohol and rubs it on her mouth making it appear to be a drunk driving accident when paramedics and law enforcement arrive on the scene. Like I said, it's been ages since I saw it, but do know it was airing on TV at the time. We didn't have cable nor satellite, so it would've been basic channels (if any of that makes a difference). I've tried a number of times, over the years, to find the name of this movie, but everything I've found either says it doesn't exist, that I'm remembering wrong or gives a list of movies that most definitely aren't it. Thank you for the help in advance.	Movie where woman is ran off the road and her daughter is taken. Ok, so everything I search says this movie doesn't exist.

1l8ffik	Fantasy from late 80's or early 90's	I think this was a movie, but I saw it on TV and may have been some sort of made for TV thing, or an episode on some kind of anthology. I would have seen it on TV in the late 80's or early 90's. The thing about it, it presented two different stories and it cut back and forth between them, even though the stories didn't directly interact or affect each other. One story (the one I remember more clearly) was a fairy tale kind of thing where a little boy and girl come across a witch who turns the girl into a bird and takes her captive. The boy goes on some kind of quest to get a flower from a mountain that is guarded by some kind of snow beast, to try to confront the witch and get his friend back. He defeats the witch, but the girl remains a bird, and he opens her cage and lets her free. The other story I remember far less is more a swords and sorcery kind of thing, about a traditional hero trying to rescue his princes/love interest from his enemy. He does, but he and the girl end up going their separate ways at the end. While the stories don't directly affect each other or interact, they are explicitly set up as analogues of each other. Comparing the boy rescuing the girl from the witch to the warrior rescuing the princess from his enemy. At the end of both, the hero saves his love, but must let her go free. I remember cutting back and forth between two versions of a similar story to be a novel story telling approach.

1kugi1y	Please find	MISSING FILM - Need Help Finding It! Hi! I've been trying to identify a film I watched a while ago but can't remember the name. I hope someone here recognizes it based on the following details: What I Remember: - Setting: The film takes place mostly in a barren, yellowish desert landscape. There's a single-story, isolated building by the roadside. At the beginning of the film, there's a ""For Sale"" sign in front of it. - Purpose of the Place: The building functions like a brothel, but with no physical contact. Men come in and speak with women located in various themed rooms via old-fashioned phones. The women can't see the men, but the men can observe the women. - Rooms: Each room has a different color and theme. I particularly remember one being pink. - Key Moment: In one scene, a man talks to a woman who doesn't recognize him at first. But then she realizes who he is from his voice and starts crying. - Mood &amp; Style: The film is quiet, melancholic, slow-paced, with a slightly futuristic or artistic atmosphere. - Visuals: Muted colors, retro visuals, old phones, and a 70s-80s aesthetic. - Likely an indie or festival film. Might have even been a single episode from an anthology series (like Room 104 or Black Mirror). - Probably released in the last 10 years. I watched it via a platform like Stremio. What It's Not: - Not Eyes Wide Shut - Not Cam (2017) - Not Ex Machina, Under the Skin, or Perfect Blue - Not a mainstream Hollywood production Not an erotic film - it's more emotional/psychological in tone If this rings any bells - even a title, actor, director, or specific scene reference - I'd be incredibly grateful. Thank you in advance for helping solve this mystery!	Please find MISSING FILM - Need Help Finding It! Hi! I've been trying to identify a film I watched a while ago but can't remember the name.

1lgbnhu	Frankenstein movie with a particular scene about a bride	Hi there, I'm looking for an 80s-90s movie (or early 00s), about Dr Frankenstein and his monster. I remember a particular scene where they're trying to create a bride to the monster, out of the cells of Dr Frenkenstein's wife/fiance; I think she needed to have her arm in a machine or something. But she can't endure the pain so the doctor turns the machine off which causes the monster to get angry. Or something like that. It might either be a very well-known movie, or some made-for-tv-crap. :) Thank you!

But she can't endure the pain so the doctor turns the machine off which causes the monster to get angry. Or something like that. It might either be a very well-known movie, or some made-for-tv-crap. :) Thank you!	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	1	56	508	565	9	90	99	8.89777777777778	7.7542500000000025	8.895238095238096	3	NA	NA	0	NA	NA	NA	2	2

1laanv7	Prison or military unit episode, sadistic officer and two buddies [Repost]	I'm looking for strange episode from 80's or 90's TV series. I watched it between 1999-2002. I checked all possible keywords on IMDB and PopMystic movie quote database. Unfortunately - no effect. It was 100% made in US. I don't remember a blood, so perhaps it was ""censored"" version and I'm almost sure that it was TV series in style ""JAG"" or ""Walker, Texas Ranger"". I remember only specific scene, where two men were in tough military unit. One of them was a well-built, tall guy, rather blond with long hair (someone like Jeff Daniells or Woody Harrelson). Perhaps, they are brothers or only buddies. The main character (or supporting character) also ended up in this unit (I think he resembled Ray Liotta, but I may be wrong). With his own eyes, he sees an officer say to a long-haired blond man: ""You're free, so you can go now,"" and lets him go as if on leave. The blond man walks calmly but confidently through the long corridor (maybe he even went through some kind of door, the kind with a photocell). &gt;!**The officer then treacherously shoots the unsuspecting prisoner in the back (it was sudden and lethal shot in the back).

1k7qu88	Animated movie with supernatural themes, perhaps a Halloween anthology	Back in 91 as a teenager, we had Showtime and an animated feature came on one afternoon in October. I recall it perhaps being an anthology, but I recall the last story: a guy in maybe the 1800s America goes to sleep and wakes up but doesnt recognize his surroundings. May be time displaced, but somehow winds up in a situation with a very ghostly looking woman being kidnapped in a stage coach by a couple villains. He eventually saves her but wakes up back in his time. Dont recall many more details but thinking it was Halloween themed due to the timing. Tried to narrow it down to several candidates, one being Rip van winkle but after looking at clips I dont think so. Any ideas?

1l4x5u0	Movie where old man gets his thumb torn off working on a tractor	Saw it as a kid, so it's a kid appropriate movie. The only characters I remember are a young boy and an old man, who I believe is a relative of the kid. The only scene I remember clearly, is the kid meets up with the old man, and he's injured. He was working on a tractor or some other farm equipment. He says a line something like, ""I was working on this &lt;equipment&gt;, and it took my thumb off."" The kid gets a belt and ties on the man's upper arm to help slow bleeding. And that's about all I remember. Any idea what the movie is called?

1lg5n0w	Movie about 3 heroes, one of them kidnapped, soft nudity	Hi, since now I apologize for my English, I am from Brazil! This is a B movie from 80s or 90s, what I remember was: FOR SURE: There were three heroes, they had some sort of suit something like Rocketeer, they fight some other race of humanoid-like enemies, one of them (with a mustache) is captured and taken to the enemy ship (or headquarter). Inside there, there is an enemy woman-humanoid that tries to seduce him then shows him her breasts, the hero says something like ""hey that's my patroller underwear"" to her. I watched it when I was a kid, so I turned off the TV for not be beaten by my mother for watching naked people. The alien enemies skins are all GREEN. NOT SURE: There are spaceships or giant robots involved. The heroes greeted each other with some sort of pose (like Usain Bolt's pose of victory) This movie was exhibited in the afternoon so it´s not a lot of nudity involved, sorry it was one of the few things I remember.

1lebub4	Looking for a horror movie where a woman lives alone in a vila close to the sea in either France, Italy or Spain and keeps seeing green and red monsters at night	Hey everyone, I'm looking for a horror movie I saw a few years back. I tried asking ChatGPT but no luck unfortunately :( Not sure when I saw this movie exactly, some time between 2018 and 2021 and if I remember correctly the movie must have been from the 2010s. Saw it on my computer from one of the not so official streaming sites lol. From my memory this was a French or maybe an Italian movie (could also be Spanish but I don't think so). It was about a young, dark-haired woman who went to a villa in either countries mentioned, close to the seaside. I remember there was a pool in front of the villa, lots of lush plants and you could see the seaside from the villa (the vila seemed to be a bit up on a hill or sth, typical for the French or Italian Riviera). I'm not sure why she went to this villa, I think it was originally her grandma's house. She probably inherited it from her gran who had just died. From my memory there was little to no speaking in this movie at all also almost no other actors? During the day everything is fine but at night she keeps seeing green and red monsters (her dead grandma?) from what I remember. I'm not sure what happened at the end. Man it's so frustrating, I know I was totally weirded out at this movie but I also kinda enjoyed it lol, so I would like to check this out again. CAN SOMEONE PLZ HELP ME? >z	Looking for a horror movie where a woman lives alone in a vila close to the sea in either France, Italy or Spain and keeps seeing green and red monsters at night Hey everyone, I'm looking for a horror movie I saw a few years back.

1kfd8c2	Not sure on release date or names of actresses or actors	There's two brothers. One plays a violin or viola and the other owns a bar. The brother with the instrument always goes into this record shop and asks for the same record every time but the store owner always says no, that he doesn't have it or it's out of stock. A girl comes to this small town on a bus and goes to the bar where the other brother works. She asks to use the bathroom and the brother tells her where it's at. She starts smoking weed in the bathroom and the brother smells it and tells her to leave, that it's not allowed. He asks where the weed is at and she lies and says there's no weed cus she already flushed it down the toilet. He kicks her out. Later in the movie she meets the brother who plays the instrument and she takes a liking to him as a friend. He develops a crush on her but never says it I think. The brother who's a bar owner says she's a bad influence and that she needs to stay away from his brother. Side note: these two brothers grew up with an abusive alcoholic dad. I think the violin was given to one of the brothers by the father and he kept it since then. The one with the violin is also disabled. There was an accident when he was a kid where he fell through ice and got trapped in the water and the water causes brain damage. I can't remember if it's a speech impediment or if he's deaf. Pretty sure he's the older brother. The younger brother who is a bar owner pulled the other brother out from water when he was about to drown and water got in his brain and messed in up or something. Later in the movie, the brother with the violin wanted to go see a movie shoot and he's in a telephone box. These other guys who always bully him push the phone booth on its side to mess with him and so that he can't get out and the other brother is called out to come and help. Fast forward, the girl is told once again she's a bad influence and then her and the brother who owns the bar have sex. Fast forward past that, she is walking down a road and a car pulls up and she gets inside and is later found dead. They hold her funeral in the house and the brother with the violin starts playing it. I must mention that throughout the movie, he never plays it once. Everyone wants him to play it and he never does until the funeral.	Not sure on release date or names of actresses or actors There's two brothers. One plays a violin or viola and the other owns a bar.

1kja1vj	Help me find the (Probably) German romantic movie	Hi everyone! I'm trying to find the title of a German film I saw years ago, most likely released between **2003 and 2015**. I only remember bits and pieces of the plot, but here's what I can recall: * The main character is a **young woman (2035)** who is standing at a **bus stop** when someone throws something at her. A man intervenes and defends her. He then strikes up a conversation with her, joking that hes her **guardian angel**. * Shes surprised and curious about his interest in her, but eventually they spend more time together and get closer. * At some point, she visits his **family** and realizes he's a genuinely **kind and caring man** who looks after a **sick family member**. * She slowly **falls in love** with him. * Near the **end of the movie**, she discovers that he actually **bullied her as a child**, which shocks and upsets her  especially because he **never told her the truth** about their shared past. * The final scene takes place in a **bakery** where she works. He visits her and says something like: *You used to be a nerdy girl with glasses,* and she replies, *And you were a chubby little boy.* They **reconcile** and its implied theyll be together. I'm almost certain this was a **German TV film or romantic drama**. It had a warm, emotional tone with a touch of humor.

Its in a contemporary setting, and there is some kind of demon monster flying around, I remember it being pretty spiky and dark. There is a scene where a dude is shooting it head on with a rifle and the monster just takes it without caring. Another scene (i'm not sure, but maybe it's a series?) when you see the (spiky) shadow of the monster approaching on a wall. There is also a point where a dude is crying pretty badly.

1ldt90e	Looking for a late 60s or early 70s British heist film.	It is Seven Times Seven. Actually an Italian film. Thank you u/Vexxt. While perusing an r/movies post about heist movies yesterday, I thought of a movie I watched on TV some 50 years ago. I think it opens with some sort of protest (or maybe a riot?) in an English prison. Anyway, a bunch of prisoners end up in the prison infirmary. I'm pretty sure this is set on July 30 1966 because the whole country shuts down to watch England play West Germany in the World Cup finals. The prisoners who were sent to the infirmary escape from prison, pull off the heist, and then break back into the prison, having set it up that no one noticed their absence. There's a scene where the police investigating the crime keep pulling up records of likely suspects,and, oops, they're locked up.

1k87qrw	Water anime	This is going to be very vague and Im sorry. I was maybe 3-6 when every week my dad would bring to to the local movie rental store (cant remember which one) to rent a specific anime movie. The only things I can really remember is it being very blue and there being some sort of water dimension. It was in Japanese and this wouldve been around 2008-2012 but I dont know when the movie was made.	Water anime This is going to be very vague and Im sorry.

1l7f3hj	Help with movie - like The Ruins	I've just seen a movie called The Ruins, and the whole time I was waiting for time in the film to go really fast while they were down in the hole but it never did. I've seen a movie soooo similar where a group go down a hole and time goes super fast down there, everytime they come back to the surface years have gone by but to them it was days. There were camera angles of the sky out of the hole going by and the sun setting and sun rising within like 5 seconds. Anyone help?

Near the end the action take place in their home against the typical 90s ponytail yuppie bad guy and his crew.

1kqchhy	Pls help me find the movie.	There's this scene where the girl stabs the guy in the stomach and he's holding his innards. The location is a hotel room and around the bedroom door. And to dispose the body, the female goes to a plumber/guy with tools and ask for a bonesaw/hacksaw. The plumber/guy with the tools jokes around and ask what does she need it for, she literally says the truth in her reply ie. to dispose a body. But the plumber/guy with the tools takes it as a joke and gives it to her. So that's the scene I remember. Saw this back in 2014. I thought it was ""Gone girl"" starring Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike but it wasn't the movie. Thank you.	Pls help me find the movie.

I just can't remember the title, I know there were a lot of cheesy low budget black comedies in that decade. Kind of reminds me of Next Friday.

1lf9fwc	What movie is this?	Maybe from the 80s or early 90s. A white guy is in (I think) Japan and he gets on the subway. He sees a guy touching a girl under her skirt. He talks about it to other men while having dinner. Then he tries to do the same to a couple of white high schoolers, but they start screaming, and he gets in trouble because of that.

1l7gwia	Looking for an action/war movie with a bus scene and defense of a building on a wasteland	Hi everyone, I'm trying to find a movie I watched around 2020 or 2021, but Im not sure about the exact release year (probably between 2000 and 2020). Heres what I remember: * The movie is set in contemporary times, not historical or sci-fi. * Its an action/war film. * The setting is bleak, with a kind of autumnal color palette at the start. * At the beginning, theres a short scene where a regular bus full of civilians is stopped by some armed men  possibly criminals or border guards. * The main character is a broad, bearded man around 40+, wearing civilian clothes but likely a former soldier or mercenary. * During the bus stop, he kills one of the armed men unexpectedly. * Later, the group (including a woman who is not the main character) defends a building/base on a wasteland or remote area. * The actors are not very famous, more unknown faces. * Its not a horror or thriller, but a straightforward action or war movie. If anyone knows what movie this might be, please let me know! Ive searched a lot but cant find it anywhere. Thanks a lot!

1ke04c2	Trying to find an airport anime scene	Hello I'm from France. My english is far to be perfect. I have to use a translator sometimes. (Srry) Im looking for a scene that Im pretty sure comes from an anime  not an isekai or reincarnation-type series, but more of a niche or underground animation. At some point, a character goes through a security gate and realizes the machine is talking. They end up getting stuck in the machine and gradually lose their mind (go crazy). I know this exists, but I just cant remember the name of the anime or series.	Trying to find an airport anime scene Hello I'm from France. My english is far to be perfect.

1ldcudf	Soldier with odd knife in his back	I remember a couple frames, showing a mysterious soldier among plenty of others in the process of moving around in a conflict context, maybe in a city, and that one soldier has a mysterious knife stuck in his back for some reason yet acts as normal as the other ones around him. The camera lingers on that oddity, showing that either that soldier or the knife or both are something special in the movie/series, before the soldier gets lost in the mess again. I cant even remember if the soldiers use guns or blades to figure out more context.

1kn62kr	Say name please	Hi, Im trying to identify a movie or TV series I saw someone watching on a plane. I only remember a specific scene: There were two women sitting on a fancy couch in what looked like a palace. One of them was wearing a tight black and white maxi dress, had black hair, and was wearing a tall hat. Next to her was a blonde girl with slightly wavy long hair and an innocent-looking face. In front of them stood two men who seemed to be talking. Suddenly, one of the men  who had a beard and was wearing an unbuttoned white shirt and maybe brown pants  ran away. The other man started chasing him. They both ran out of the palace and into a large garden. It looked like a recent production, not something old. The whole setting felt elegant or aristocratic.

1lbcm01	I've bee going crazy trying to find this!	It's a cgi animation movie, in it there are a family who live in a village, and there's also another dude either part of the family or a friend (let's call him bob). So the father of the family (let's call him dick) one day bans bob from the village because dick eats 2 pies everyday, and bob ate one of his pies. After talking to his wife about it he decides to go find bob and tell him he is forgiven (dick's such a dick). So after searching for bob, dick finds out that bob is the king of a town. How? Well bob has tamed a mechanical giant bird that everyone fears. Later we find out that the bird isn't sentient and is actually controlled by a remote controller. The previous king got tired of power and threw it away for bob to later find after being abandoned and decided to become a fisherman That's all I remember, I don't know how it ended, but not knowing the name of it bugs me really hard I hope someone has heard of it.

1lfgvaa	Vampire/Werewolf/Monster Movie?	Back in the late 90s-00s, I was flipping through channels late at night, and stumbled upon a scene where there was a woman (who at the time I believed was Samantha Mathis), in a white, flowy gown (i think), and she was running through a graveyard. It looked like the set of a play, or an older movie. Black backdrop, cheesy looking graves. She was chased by some monster, and her clothes were torn off. There was partial nudity (breasts). I cannot for the life of me even find anything that comes close to this, and it's driven me nuts for years (Mainly because once I found IMDB, I looked up Samantha Mathis, and pretty much ruled her out).

I think someone was trying to find her and maybe there was an evil queen and at one point she starts floating maybe as light as a feather? I have tried searching multiple times but havent been able to find it. Thank you!!!

My memory is hazy, but one scene stuck with me. A killer enters a house and kills a man downstairs in the living room. The mans wife is upstairs, sitting in front of a mirror, removing her makeup. She doesnt hear anything. The killer goes upstairs, kills her (I dont remember how exactly), and then smears something yellow and greasypossibly fat or something bodilyall over the mirror she was using. It was a very disturbing and visceral moment, and that image has haunted me ever since. Does this ring any bells for anyone? Would love to know what movie this is!

1l66pww	Help with title of the movie	I am trying to find a movie (possibly an older movie) about a woman who was either a judge or an attorney and she sentences a innocent man back to jail all because of his prior history. Anyway, the woman is awaken at night by sounds of someone on her patio, so she ends up calling the 911 dispatcher and just as she is about to confront whomever is out on her patio, she turns on the patio light and screams in horror as it turns out the felon she convicted and sentenced him to prison, finds out where she lives and chases her in the house. She was able to get away, but I need to know the name of the movie. Some hints here where she tries to escape by opening her garage door, but she's been having some issues with the garage door and she ended up reversing her black corvette out of the house and sped off into the night. Please help me find this movie as to it was on Netflix a few months ago, and now since its gone, you can't place the name or the face. It would all work itself out and hopefully, I would find the name of that movie.

1l8otm2	Movie Title	Hi everyone, Im trying to remember the name of a movie with a specific chase scene. In this scene, two people are involved in a chase one is pursuing the other. The person being chased had anticipated the end of a sports game (I believe its a baseball game), and waits just outside or near the stadium. As soon as the game ends and the crowd starts pouring out of the stadium, he uses the confusion and mass of people to escape. He grabs a cap and a polo shirt or some other clothing/accessories from one of the vendor stands near the stadium to blend in with the crowd and hide from the person chasing him. But even after the disguise, the pursuer still manages to spot him in the crowd, and the chase continues from there. I dont remember the actors or the title, but this specific sequence is stuck in my mind. Any idea what movie this could be?

1lk7vt5	90s hong kong movie i have been trying to find for a VERY long time	I saw this movie on a random night on my tv, its was a 90s hong kong movie spoken in either madarin or cantonese (pretty sure its madarin) i only remember a few details but the whole premise of the movie was that the city was on lockdown from protests and crimes and they would invade houses but no the ones with a yellow tag. The main character was a male and on the way he had a partner which was a female. I remeber a scene where a fat guy was harrassing this girl and thats where the main character saves and comforts the girl. The title is 4 characters long in simplified chinese. The whole movie is sad and depressing, not really thrilling but just really dark and sad. Watching it makes you uncomfortable (that sort of vibe). Sorry for little to no information i was really young when i watched it and i cannt remember anything. If you guys have anything quesions i try to answer them with the best of my abilties!	90s hong kong movie i have been trying to find for a VERY long time I saw this movie on a random night on my tv, its was a 90s hong kong movie spoken in either madarin or cantonese (pretty sure its madarin) i only remember a few details but the whole premise of the movie was that the city was on lockdown from protests and crimes and they would invade houses but no the ones with a yellow tag.

1l4vcg0	Movie with MRI scene	Recently our work break room tv was switched to something called the movie hub channel. There was a movie playing with the following scenes but there was no sound and I only got to see about 10 mins. There is a young woman with dark hair that is under going a MRI type test. The other people are a younger black guy, a middle aged white guy and a white woman also probably middle age. I didn't recognize a single actor. They seemed very concerned about the brain scan because it looked like all electrical impulses and not a normal brain. It looked like a fairly recent movie but I can't be sure. It just looked modern not like any of the Species movies and definitely not the CDC scene from TWD.

I looked for the channel schedule but had no luck.	Movie with MRI scene Recently our work break room tv was switched to something called the movie hub channel. There was a movie playing with the following scenes but there was no sound and I only got to see about 10 mins. There is a young woman with dark hair that is under going a MRI type test. The other people are a younger black guy, a middle aged white guy and a white woman also probably middle age. I didn't recognize a single actor.

1lc7ucu	What is the title of this movie???	I have been searching for years to figure out the name of this movie. I know for certain it would come on the Chiller channel on tv. All I remember is a group of people going to this mansion and this nerdy guy would come over and intercom and make them play these tv death type games for his amusement. There was a huge beefy muscular guy and the bad guy over the intercom was also filming them I believe. I cannot find anything about it anywhere and no it isnt Saw. It is like a pretty low budget type movie.	What is the title of this movie??? I have been searching for years to figure out the name of this movie.

1l3b581	Pre-1990 Sci-fi/Horror You must die so your family can survive	I remember this brief scene from when I was a kid and my dad was channel surfing. I saw as much as is described below, but then got too scared and asked him to switch it off. Always wondered what the heck it was. ___ ""On TV in the early 90s, but no older than maybe the early 70s. ""In color, but a night scene, so mostly dark, black, grays, and blues. ""Had a Science Fiction / Fantasy vibe to it. Based on the tone and quality, Id say it was a film, and not a television show from the time. ""A woman is strapped to the ground, screaming, on a rocky outcropping outdoors, on a slab with restraints like the old Frankenstein movies, while a lightning storm rages. ""A man who is seemingly her captor hovers calmly above her, and tells her something along the lines of You must die so your family can survive. He says this in a very reassuring tone. ""Lightning strikes whatever apparatus she is attached to, and she is transformed into a robotic metal humanoid shape, with a smooth spherical face with no features, and she is now presumably dead. ___ At this point Im freaked out, and tell my dad to change the channel.

1k6444p	Help?? Can't find movie	I can't remember what streaming service I watched this on. It was a foreign movie, I think the title was one word and it wasn't English if I remember. I think it was Japanese, Korean, or Chinese? Maybe Filipino. It's based around these teenage girls, they go into an all girls community/temple like thing. The leader is young and he holds like group prayers over them. The girls start getting possessed (maybe mimics?) and not acting themselves. He will pray over any girl acting weird but he's actually getting them cursed. He uses that to his advantage to have sexual relations with them. There was something about he hid his mom in a secluded room because she knew too much or something, and in the end a teenage girl kills him on the bridge that leads out of the community and there is the apparition of the god he was betraying there to help? Hopefully someone can find it, I want to watch it again.	Help?? Can't find movie I can't remember what streaming service I watched this on.

1l9quua	I think it was post apocalyptic	Typical hero's journey film where everything is dark gray, metal, and dirty. So that's why I think it was post apocalyptic. There's a scene where the male protagonist walks into a room/booth and engages with a therapist through a wall-mounted TV-ish screen, except the therapist appears on that screen as a geometric talking fox. See image below, except the fox was grayscale. It reminded me of the animoji things that Apple created, where the character moves its mouth, shrugs its shoulders, and does facial expressions to match the user in real time. Except it feels like I saw this movie 15+ years ago. I think after he left the room/booth, they flashed to the woman who had been the actual therapist. I didn't see it in the theater and it wasn't a blockbuster-type movie. Straight to streaming, probably. Good luck everybody!!

1kixy8c	Movie about teen witches (who are not witches)	I've been looking for this movie forever. It's a movie about a group of young girls who create a club around being witches. They are bullied and shunned by the people in their town, and one girl in the group commits suicide by taking pills, causing the group to fall apart. The entire plot of the movie though, is that there was no magic involved and they were never witches. They also made ""invitations"" into the group with a piece of folded paper that had a triangle and circle on it, almost like Harry Potter. I can't remember all of the details, but I can provide more if needed. If I remember correctly, the group was all girls around the age of middle schoolers or early highschool.

1kekswt	Live action movie about a magic stone, a lighthouse and a kid from 90s or early 2000s	Hi! I remember watching this movie as a kid 17 year ago or so on the tv, don't remember exactly if it was Boomerang or other channel. The plot is about a kid that has to go and search a magic stone that grants wishes (the stone shines and is white), don't remember exactly why but there is a lighthouse in the plot too and is very important. The kid is black haired and the town where he lives is very rustic (stone roads and so), like a italian port city. Sorry if my explanation is poor but I was 7 years old when I watched that movie and I like it a lot, it was very magical and heartwarming.

I hope someone here can help me. I watched it between 2020 and 2022 on Netflix, Prime Video, or Telegram, with subtitles in Spanish. Thing that I remember for sure: "" Its a movie (NOT a series), probably Korean, but it could also be English, Japanese, or Chinese. "" The main character is a man, a novice graphic designer or artist. "" He starts either freelancing or looking for a job and eventually gets hired by a cosmetics or advertising company. "" The office is modern with lots of glass walls. "" The main project is designing a poster for a fictional womens perfume. The poster features a model and a moon, with purple or blue tones. "" The model is an important character, she talks to the protagonist, and theres some jealousy from someone else. "" The final scene I remember clearly is the protagonist riding in a taxi, car, or bus, looking out the window and seeing his poster displayed large on a building in the city. "" The tone is light, not too emotional or romantic, more about professional growth and office life. I dont remember the actors name or many plot details, but I know its not a youthful or school drama, not about music. Does anyone recognize this movie? Thanks a lot in advance! =O Spanish: Hola a todos, llevo años intentando recordar una película y no logro dar con el título.

1l6zeaz	An older movie (possibly 80s or early 90s) about a woman who ends up in an abusive relationship.	The scene I vividly remember is the man drags the woman into a tattoo parlor (I'mm pretty sure they are in a city setting) and torments her by saying he's going to force her to get a tattoo against her will. I think one of the tattoos he points to and suggests is a ""tattoo of a bleeding heart"". What movie is this?

1kc1hyb	Movie about an alien mother and child/family that terrorizes a family in their home	Ive been trying to find out what a movie I swear I saw as a kid is. From what I remember (this was 20+ years ago) there was a family that lived in a normal suburban neighborhood. There were this little fuzzy(?) aliens/creatures that terrorized them and maybe kidnapped the families son. I think they hid and moved around through the vents and the chimney of the house. It definitely wasnt Dont Be Afraid of the Dark, the creatures in that dont resemble the creatures in the movie Im trying to find. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

1lih6xe	Romantic film with the cure themed main character	Hey guys. Many ears ago I watched a movie, that I hardly remember now, but I know I liked it a lot. It was sort of indie romantic maybe rom com to some degree. A bit allenish maybe too. Not sure if it was an american or european movie. The main character was young guy, with hair stylized like the Cure's Robert Smith. And he was sort of that sad guy persona, fallen in love in some girl. I think the film ended with him dancing (alone?) to Cure's Boys Don't Cry song. Also I think he had younger brother or brothers. It's not much, but maybe someone?

1kp7ga3	Hi. I cant remember much about it but There was a movie or show i saw as a kid. An alien came to earth and started eating ppl.	The main character (a kid, maybe 12 years old) was trying to stop it. The alien walked on 2 legs. Most prominent memory I have of it was the principal and I think a teacher were having an affair at the school. They got busy in the office after hours while the secretary left. Secretary went out to her car and the alien ate her. The kid was in the parking lot and watched it go down. I can't remember much else But I'm hoping someone can and can tell me the name of it. Had to be a 90s or early 2000s movie. I've been wondering what that movie was for over a decade but I can't remember the name. It was not ""star kid.""	Hi.

1liurz4	Looking for a movie or TV show where someone mentions tracking government activity through pizza orders?	I remember seeing a scene  maybe in a show or a movie  where someone said that you could tell something big was happening in the government (like at the White House or Pentagon) based on how many pizzas were being ordered. It wasnt the main plot or anything, just a quick line or clue during an investigation. Something like, theyre ordering a ton of pizza, somethings going down. I feel like it couldve been in House of Cards, The West Wing, Homeland, or maybe even a political movie like All the Presidents Men, but Im not 100% sure. It couldve also been from a documentary or a news segment. Does anyone else remember this or know where this line comes from?

Anyway two of them went upstairs to a bedroom, but not for that. One of them told the other that he had to swallow a balloon, which was un-inflated on a string, and to trust that he'd pull it out. When he went to pull it out, only the string came out. And the other guy was dead.	Early 2000s party scene. I saw a few minutes of a movie around 2002-2003, I think.

1l7argb	[1990s-2000s] Crime/Heist/Black Comedy/British accents	Looking for a movie I saw in the late 2000's at a friends house. My memory is that the main characters are 4 men, one black and three white, all wearing suits, and at the beginning one of the white guys has a briefcase or something stolen after being hit by a car with teenagers or something in it. The people in the car don't know what's in the briefcase but take it. Has diamonds or something in it. The guy remembers the license plate and the 4 men try to track it down. At one point, they are all having to go up to a house that has a lot of stairs, and the black guy kicks or hits one of the people in the house as they are leaving saying something like 'That's for making me walk up stairs!'. I think the dvd cover of the movie had a lot of yellow in it but I can't be sure. They all have british accents and pretty sure it is set in England somewhere but I searched through all movies and covers I can find online from 1990-2010 and can't find it so perhaps it is an independent niche movie. Edit: Additional info. I think, but I could be wrong, the movie opens with a daytime jewelry store heist, with the jewelry store being on a street corner.

1kcmctq	Late 90s/Early 2000s comedy - Teen with PC	Added nsfw because of the porn joke and spoiler because it involves a gag near the end. This memorys been bugging me for a while - I think the movie involves a house party or something like that. Theres a gag about this one teen character with a PC that his mother believes is for school and the father knows is for porn. Near the end he ends up finding a photo of his mother on a porn site and smashes the computer in the living room of the house saying something like what has been seen cannot be unseen. I think theres a house party or something because when he finds the photo theres a (homeless?) guy who was at the party that asks if he can print the photo. Does this ring a bell for anyone?

1ljlb6h	A mystery movie in a winter cabin	Hello everybody Around 2014-2015, might be year of production around 2010. I saw a movie that was about a recently dead grandfather that wasnt really dead. It took place over Christmas in a winter cabin, he had a granddaughter that was good in solving riddles and she was the first that discovered he still lived. It had a riddle with a music box that was disguised as hidden in the Christmas tree. They had to enter the melody into a not working clock on the wall and it opened and it had a key inside. It had hidden rooms and other such things. The grandpa was watching everyone on cameras and when she discovered him, she joined him and they worked together with her in disguise. I think it had something to do with inheritance or maybe they wanted to kill him. I also remember he had a very old butler helping him that was kinda shady in the end. If anyone could help me I would appreciate it, I have been looking for it for like 5 years.

1lelwcl	Old Black and White surreal horror film/tunnel monster/dripping man	I was at a haunted house in 2013, and they were projecting this film on the side of the building. It was a black and white horror (possibly 50s or 60s, but I started to think that it might be a more modern, like 80s or 90s, attempt at mimicking the classic style). There was a lady that climbed a ladder or something down into a huge cylindrical tunnel. There was a monster at the end of the tunnel, and it nearly took up the whole width and height of the tunnel. The monster wasn't humanoid at all, but it had a face. It was like a huge mesh of flesh and limbs. An insanely fleshy, nasty monster. I think I remember it charging through the tunnel. There was also this guy interacting with the protagonist, and he was dripping in oil or blood. He wasn't just wet. It looked like he was made of whatever he was dripping. His face kind of looked like chocolate melting. Just a consistent ooze. I remember the film being surreal af, and the only thing I could compare it to at the time was Carnival of Souls. Would appreciate any suggestions.	Old Black and White surreal horror film/tunnel monster/dripping man I was at a haunted house in 2013, and they were projecting this film on the side of the building.

It is possibly filmed in Scotland, England or Ireland. Action took place on a hill, seems like cold summer, cloudy weather, dark grass and the grey sea behind. Colours of this scene are grey and cold. Woman (similar to Keira Knightley, dark hair, taller than average, slim, white) comes out of the sea, up to the hill to dress(possibly). Then she meets a man(she's already dressed), who looks tall, slim, with dark, short hair and dark eyes and his eyebrows are placed low, close to his eyes, similar to Theo James and maybe Damon from vampire diaries, but he has blue eyes). They don't know each other, but his attitude is rather hostile. I remember there was a dialogue about her sight, glance. Won't tell the exact thing, but she looks at him and he at her and he says something sexist to her like ""A woman should not look in the eyes of stranger/man (without permission - maybe he added that at the end)"".

1kk9k30	Old 2d water color mini movie	I know for a fact that the mini movie exists. It's about a little lady who lives in a little house who's infatuated with a boy made of ice. Post of course includes spoilers! The ice boy takes her outside with him in an ice carriage with her being wrapped in thick blankets, but she can't stand the cold and either: dies or survives when the ice boy brings her back, I don't remember which. I was traumatized as a little kid, because the ice boy melts in the end and it's flowing red water color. No dialogue, just music like jinggles to indicate speech and mood. 2D, maybe stop motion , no clay figures. The ice prince had a spiky neck accessory, and I think he only came out at night due to the sun. I think the movie begins with a shot of the little girls house and the night stars lighting up with twinkle sound effects while her window lights up.

1kdxz25	Was this movie a fever dream?	Right. I have been desperately trying to remember this movie for at least a decade. I saw it when I was a younger child. Its highly likely it was a maid for TV movie aimed at children. The main protagonist are a group of children, one of whom is a cowboy. It is later revealed in the movie. He was only pretending to be a cowboy to impress the other kids. I believe he did some rope tricks in the movie, and I distinctly remember a scene where he put his ear to the ground to listen for danger. The children were being pursued by some sort of bad guys. Unfortunately, I dont remember them very well. It takes place in a modern setting, and the movie couldnt have been released after like 2010 at the latest. I just remember the cowboy kid saying all kinds of stuff like he knew what he was talking about and guiding the other children only for it to be later revealed that he was full of =©.

1k7usfc	Can anyone help me with this?	Ok, so I'm confident this is a kids movie I watched sometime 2016-2018 I think? It's about these 2 rich(?) kids who are out in this forest vacation or something with their parents (I think the children are friends). I dont remember a lot of the movie but I believe there is a scene where they are going white water rafting and a hole is poked in the inflatable raft by someone. Besides that scene all I remember is that the 2 kids had an adult they were close with and that the 2 adults worked together to abduct the children and a dog ends up saving the children. I know this is a very vague descripition and I wouldn't be suprised if the movie doesn't even exist, but if anyone might have even the slighest clue on what movie this is it would a great help.

ChatGPT wrote this for me, its probably pretty obvious. My wife has been on Tubi for a couple weeks searching for this movie. I would appreciate any help finding. She watched this movie sometime between January and March 2025, likely on Tubi. The plot goes like this: a group of about 7 longtime female friends go to a cabin. A year earlier, at that same cabin, the husband of one of the women was murdered. The group then tracked down and killed the man responsible for it. In the present, the women are visiting the cabin for the first time since it all happened. One of the women begins killing off the others, while trying to make the widow believe the man they killed is somehow still alive and coming for revengeso its part slasher, part psychological thriller. At the end, theres a memorable fight scene between the killer and a Black woman in the group, where they yell bitch at each other multiple times. That moment really stuck out. I think it was a lower-budget film but well done. Any idea what its called? Thanks in advance!!	Please help. My wife has been searching for a movie she saw but she doesnt know the title.

Im starting to think I imagined it. It mightve been a series but I think it was a movie. I only remember bits and pieces so stay with me, its kind of vague; - theres this brick like apartment on the ground floor? I think a younger woman (maybe a teenage girl) gets grabbed and dragged inside. Im not sure, I dont remember if it was British or German - she gets rescued and stays with family? Im not sure if its her family or someone elses family but she stays with one. Shes skinny and healing at the time but I dont remember what she looked like (going back and forth between blonde and brown hair) - I have a faint memory of her reconnecting with a boyfriend or a childhood boy she has a crush on or something like that but gets sad when she learns that he has a girlfriend or he rejects her - I think, towards the end of the movie, she gets kidnapped by the same guy in a mall? And then gets taken to a house somewhere where she gets out but the kidnapper is stuck inside while it burns down at the end of the movie. If anyone could help me find it, Id be so grateful, Ive been going nuts trying to figure it out while replaying the faint memories in my head. Ill add that it wasnt modern, maybe 2000s? Not older than that though, I possibly watched it 9-10 years ago?	Kidnapping movie, I think?

1l4f14g	Time travel, an author, and her spy great grandma	Not sure if this is a movie or a show. If it's a show then it was a single episode. The plot is basically about a woman who is a journalist/author/historian of some sort, and she is writing a book about her ancestor, who was supposedly a Mata Hari-like figure (a femme fatale spy who seduced soldiers and high officials to learn their secrets), during one of the World Wars I believe. The woman is having writer's block because (IIRC) she thinks that her ancestor may have been a double agent but she doesn't have enough evidence, and that's why she can't finish her book. The woman ends up time traveling to find out what happened to her ancestor so that she can finish her book. IMPORTANT INFO: I'm pretty sure the woman is not a time traveler herself. Originally, I thought this might've been some sort of Star Trek or Dr. Who episode, because I very much remember that she got there with the help of other people who actually do Technology Things. Once she gets to the past, I think she herself assumes the role of her ancestor, and goes and does the spy work, learning first hand what her ancestor did and how she did it. What I'm 100% certain about is the ending scene. The woman turns to the other characters and tells them that she's figured out how her ancestor smuggled info, and shows them how there's strips of paper rolled up and tucked into the curls of a young girl.

1ljh0ay	80s Poor woman pretending to be rich.	Saw a film on TV when I was kid in which a working class woman falls in love with a rich man and shes mistaken for being rich herself. The only scene I really remeber is shes invited to a rich social gathering/party and she has car trouble on the way. She stops at a gas station and checks the oil. When she finally arrives at the party she is forced to valet. During the party, her rich love interest notices oil on her face and asks what happened and she comments that she was checking the dipstick on her car and he immediately exclaims to everyone how down-to-earth she is. When she leaves, the valet brings her crappy car out right when her crush walks out and her crush sees it. She quickly lies and tells the valet that the piece of junk isnt her car and that she arrived in a blue BMW. They laugh it off and her crush leaves in his limousine. The valet returns and says he cant find a blue BMW and she admits that the old piece of junk was her car.	80s Poor woman pretending to be rich.

His friends basically call him out for lying saying that one of the animals he killed on the trip was not possible because it was to hard of shot to it. Then he gets super upset and ends up writing in blue marker or crayon some huge obscenity on the bathroom wall and the next scene is him with his mother talking to the head of the school. This is pre 2010 as I saw it when I was a small child. Really want to find this movie and or show.

His friends basically call him out for lying saying that one of the animals he killed on the trip was not possible because it was to hard of shot to it. Then he gets super upset and ends up writing in blue marker or crayon some huge obscenity on the bathroom wall and the next scene is him with his mother talking to the head of the school. This is pre 2010 as I saw it when I was a small child. Really want to find this movie and or show.

1l7m5h8	¿Qué película es esta?	Es live action. Es muy alucinante la trama. Es algo gore. E irreverente. La mire al rededor del 2014 solo una vez y jamás supe su nombre. Solo tengo marcadas algunas escenas. Primero escena: Comienza con el protagonista metiendose en problemas con un hombre caucásico muy grande y calvo, con una camisa roja de leñador. El protagonista compra un hacha o martillo, va hacia el tipo y lo mata con esa herramien, después devuelve la herramienta ensangrentada a la tienda, el dependiente la mira y sin problemas acepta la devolución. (Transcurre en un vecindario nevado) Segundo escena. El protagonista se ve acorralado, tumbado en el suelo y alguien apuntan su arma asia el listo para disparar, entonces el protagonista usa una especie de ""habilidad"" para viajar al pasado, al momento en que la bala que estaba por ser disparada... En la línea de producción de municiones, nunca haya sido ensamblada correctamente, provocando su mal funcionamiento y no sea dispararda, salvando su vida el protagonista. (El protagonista lo logra distrayendo al operador de la línea de producción diciendole algo así como: ""oye"" provocando que haga una pausa en esa bala y en vez de cargar pólvora, se meta una mosca dentro del casquillo. Tercera escena. El protagonista y alguien más, quizá su interés romántico... Se encuentran huyendo de alguna especie de enten, dentro de una patrulla de policía, conduciendo se encuentra un policía afroamericano. Aparentemente están a salvo mientras conducen... De repente el policía dice que siente rara su cabeza, hambos el protagonista y el tercer personaje se miran extraños, como sabiendo lo que significa y lo que está a punto de suceder. Entonces de inmediato se le incha y explota la cabeza al policía y choca. Cuarta escena. Me parece que es una de las últimas en la película... El protagonista logra comprender sus ""habilidades"" de manipulación de la realidad. Viaja a una especie de dimensión, donde hay una especie de culto y aparentemente todo es idílico. Alguien lo recibió y le explica parte de la trama. Después se encuentran en un campo de maíz o por lo menos en un campo abierto. De repente viene trotando y saltan un rebaño de chicas desnudas con cosplay de ovejas... Es todo lo que recuerdo de la película. Si, es muy random. Quiero volver a verla porque solo la Vi una vez y quiero verla ahora con una mente de alguien mucho más grande.	¿Qué película es esta? Es live action. Es muy alucinante la trama. Es algo gore.

1lcbysb	Actionish movie where the antagonist pulls up beside the protagonist in a car, stares at him for a second then hits a guardrail launching him off the road	In the scene referenced in the title, the star is being pursued by the bad guy in a car, at one point the bad guy pulls along side him and they have a brief staredown when out of nowhere the badguy hits a guardrail launching him off the road into the ditch, the scene is abrupt and a little funny in my opinion even if it wasn't intended that way. Any help tracking this movie down would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

1lf4wnt	Weird sci fi DVD I remember seeing at the Kennedy Space Center	In one of the gift shops at the Kennedy Space Center visitor complex were various DVDs for sale. One was this weird movie that I looked up later out of curiosity and found out was a weird dystopian sci fi film that iirc was about someone inventing anti-light bulbs (light bulbs that ""glowed"" dark instead of light) to combat light pollution. The box art was the device on a white background, which kind of looked like a black grenade. I saw this in 2014, I think the movie itself came out around 2011 or so from what I remember from my old searches for it online. I think some of the people who worked on the film were South American, possibly Argentinian or Chilean?

1l8d7i0	Looking for a horror movie or series episode where a girl stabs her sister after fighting over a doll (seen on German TV around 20102015)	Hi everyone, Ive been trying to identify a movie or TV series episode I saw about 1015 years ago on German television, probably sometime between 2010 and 2015. I only saw the beginning (or possibly a scene right after a commercial break), because my grandmother turned off the TV  she said it wasnt appropriate for kids. Heres what I remember 100%: * Two girls, around 10 years old, are fighting over a doll (possibly a Barbie or similar). * One of them says something like: Thats my doll! * They tug at the doll until it breaks. * Then one of the girls goes to a kitchen drawer, grabs a knife, and stabs her sister. * The scene takes place in a kitchen  I think the mother is sitting at the table too. * It was definitely in **German**, though Im not sure if it was dubbed or originally German. * Before the scene started, there was a warning like: **""Not suitable for children""**. * It probably aired on a channel that usually shows kids or family content  possibly **Super RTL, Nickelodeon, Disney Channel, or RTL**  but **very late at night** (around 11 PM). I dont know if this was the beginning of a movie, a TV episode, or maybe a flashback. It mightve also been part of an anthology or horror short film series. I dont remember any title, music, or character names  just that scene.

And a high rank military officer in a country house in the dessert	I'm looking for a movie set in LA in the 50s or 70s. The movie should be reasonably well known, I've seen it on TV. I know for a fact that a tall, a bit chubby but not fat, rather a massive figure (he wears a classic American suit with a hat, I think the suit was light blue and is middle aged) goes to a Californian multi-party house and has an affair with a younger woman. Maybe the house is light blue maybe the woman is a prostitute. He is either secretly watched or secretly filmed or films himself or is photographed. But I think he is secretly being photographed. Then I have another memory (maybe it's from another movie, but please tell me which one): A high-ranking military man is informed about something at a country house in a desert-like landscape like California and then drives somewhere with a few of his men in a jeep. The high military man is somehow involved in something and is one of the bad guys. Please help me I'm freaking out because I just can't place these memories but I know for sure I've seen this movie(s).

The movie mainly takes place in an apartment where a couple has to take care of (their neighbor's?) baby but he ends up dying (I think) out of neglect. So the main plot is just them trying to cover up the murder. The main girl's name I think it was Sarah? But I could be wrong.	Help me find this foreign movie.

I went to an at home daycare and the lady running it was Pentecostal and she would show us this movie of like these scary looking African tribal people that were like stick figures. Not like drawn stick figures but like the characters were made from actual sticks. I remember it being pretty scary and other kids crying every time she put it on. I can't seem to find anything about it. And with her being religious maybe it was some kind of religious kids movie? The characters had like locs and some had crazy tribal masks.

1lb5oay	Horror &amp; chase movie	I watched this movie when I was a little kid, but I think it was released sometime in the 2000s. The plot was about a group of boys and girls who end up in a farm. There was a creepy old couple living there  both disabled or possibly deformed. Some man (not part of the couple) was trying to kill them one by one. In the end, only one girl survives. She finds a car key and tries to escape. While being chased by the killer, she hides in a shed and gets into a large water container (or tank) to avoid being seen.

1l779al	Nordic crime film: A girl sees her dead twin on TV and yells Mom, Im on TV!	Hi, Im looking for a movie I saw part of as a child around 20102014 on Danish TV (probably DR1). I believe it was either Norwegian or Swedish. The part I saw is about two young girls, maybe around 89 years old, who are twins (or at least look exactly alike). One of them has died  possibly murdered  and is found in a forest, maybe in something that looked like a barn, an underground pit, or a hidden bunker. The scene I remember clearly: the surviving girl is watching TV in her living room when suddenly the dead girl appears on the screen  lying on her back with open eyes. The girl yells: Mom, Mom! Im on TV! The mother (or both parents) come in and are completely shocked when they see the dead child on the screen. It was a serious, realistic crime drama (not supernatural or horror), with adult police investigators involved. Definitely not a childrens movie. Does anyone recognize this film?

1lh9fnc	Crime movie, France or Spain, 1990s	I need your help in identifying this film: I saw the movie on German television in the second half of the 1990s, I think. It's about a young couple who are engaged in criminal activities. They end up being hunted by organized crime figures (and the police?) and escape by car. The scene I remember most vividly is a scene on a beach. The couple arrives at a deserted beach. The long-haired brunette girl stays behind, sitting in the dunes, watching her boyfriend walk towards the sea. Suddenly somebody is shooting at her boyfriend from behind her in the dunes. The bullets make an eerie, whistling sound. The young man gets hit and falls down, the waves washing over his body. The killers come out of the dunes, walk past the girl and towards the body. The girl follows them. I think it is a French movie, maybe Spanish, definitely European. Made in 1993 or later, I think. The brunette actress in the movie I am looking for looks a bit like Yekaterina Golubeva (from ""Pola X"")/Valérie Kaprisky/Maruschka Detmers. The style of the movie is similar to French movies like ""Tea In The Harem"" (Le Thé au harem d'Archimède) from 1985, ""Sound And Fury"" (De bruit et de fureur) from 1988 or newer movies in that style like ""Living On Love Alone"" (D'amour et d'eau fraîche) from 2010 or the Spanish movie ""Deprisa, Deprisa"" from 1981.

In the very next scene they are having sex. Man tells woman to turn around, and they start doing doggy which gets a bit intense. Meanwhile the man's phone rings, he abruptly gets up, answers the phone and prepares to leave. Woman, still in bed, looks at him with frustration.

All I can remember is a wizard like character playing a game of chess and I believe it's referred to as 3d chess because there are multiple boards floating above each other. Outside of that I can't remember a dang thing.	Animated movie from early 90s I have been struggling for years to remember this animated movie I used to watch.

1ld3gjm	Repost - creepy animated kids movie	I remember randomly watching this movie, because it was being broadcast on the danish kids channel called DR Ramasjang. It must have been around 2012-2014 as far as I remember. I dont remember the movie in its entirety, but I'll try to go through it as good as I can. I remember the movie being computer animated, but I dont think that it was very high quality computer animation. The movie starts out with our main character being a young girl who loves and looks up to her parents. I remember the girl sitting at a vanity with her mother, admiring how beautiful she thinks that her mother is. It goes on like that for a bit, with her loving and admiring her parents. But as our main character gets older she starts to think less and less of her parents. Now she finds them embarrassing, and annoying, she even starts to find them ugly, and gross. Later in the movie she gets a boyfriend, which is a huge relief for her because finally she can be around someone her own age. At some point her boyfriend gets a facial piercing, which inspires the main character to get one for herself. Her parents are however not happy with this, and this is when the movie starts to get really weird. Her father starts talking about how she can get her piercings for free, if she lets him pierce her face. He then goes on to demonstrate how he will do so, by laying the mother down on the dinner table, then taking a hand drill, and drilling screws into the mother's face. After that both of the parents start to chase the main character and her boyfriend around the house. Trying to escape from them, the main character and her boyfriend climb up the chimney of her house, but an explosion goes off in the background, and the movie hits a sort of reset. We then see similar scenarios where the main character and her boyfriend tries to escape her crazy parents, right up till a point where theyre once again climbing the chimney. The main character then comes to the conclusion that if she wants to escape her parents shell have to kill them, she then breaks the fourth wall and looks directly at the viewer, and then says something along the lines of, dont worry, its just a cartoon. I remember being really freaked out by this part. I dont really remember much of the movie after that, but I do remember seeing the end credits roll. I dont really remember what the characters looked like, but Im pretty sure that the mother wore a long green dress with pink dots. I also cant exactly say where the movie was from, but the version I saw was dubbed in danish. Im pretty sure that the movie comes from a western country, either that or its east European. I really hope that someone can help me find this movie, because Ive been searching for it for years now. I remember that the channel would broadcast lesser known animated movies. I for example do remember seeing the movie Anna and the Moods on the channel, which is a somewhat similar movie, but its definitely not the one that im looking for.

1kom92s	need help finding this horror movie	Hello guys so I'm trying to find a horror movie I watched one time on a tv channel, its an asian horror movie but not sure which kind of asian it is. Imma try to list down things I remember about it. So basically its a group of friends and then they're in a car. So the ending of this movie, as I remember it, is that it is revealed that the girl (the main protagonist) is already dead and was the one causing the scary stuff. And I also vaguely remember that there's a scene where two of the boy that's part of their friends entered a restaurant or something and they were trapped there and was killed which also appeared in the flashback when it was revealed the girl is the ghost all along and it played out differently. These are all I remember but not sure though maybe this movie doesn't exist at all and its just my brain playing tricks on me but if it does exist and if anyone knows what it is, please tell me what it's called. Thank you.	need help finding this horror movie Hello guys so I'm trying to find a horror movie I watched one time on a tv channel, its an asian horror movie but not sure which kind of asian it is.

I remember 2 specific things. 1. Thier dog gets stuck on the cieling on its back and is crying 2. To demonstrate the ghostly encounters one of them does a trust excursise type fall and is caught by nothing, just stops mid air. I belive it ends in some witches coven with them getting attacked.

1lekc1z	Looking for a 2D animated fantasy film	The animated movie started with a description of a magical beings. They were like spirital things in some sort of egg-shaped vessels. There were two of them. One was supposed to be for the good side, purely white, while the other was for the darkness. I think they gave some sort of strong powers to the ones that used them. The two side, good and evil, had one of each vesel. The good side had a male character, a royalty, as it's leader, while the evil one a female character. In the fires of their battle they fell in love. They also had a child, that is the main character. The male character died in the begining of the story and before his child was born. I think he died because one of the spirital beings had tried escaping it's vesel. The female character had to retreat back to the darkness, perhaps because she had no other place or maybe because she knew she wouldn't take care of their child, or she was banished. The child stayed with an uncle, adopted i think, and some sort of friend of his. They weren't human, some sort of creatures like the uncle was a cat, while the friend, female, was a puppy. Throughout the movie it was revealed that the child had become a vessel since he was born for the spirital creature of darkness. The uncle had died by the child's mother, who seeked to once again see her beloved by reviving him. She planned to use the power of both spirital creatures and sacrifice about 10000 lives. In the end her child managed to convince her in the final acts of her plan. In effort to return the sacrificed lives back, she exchanged her own. The two spirital creatures stayed by the child's side in the end. The parents were both mortal. Their romance was also in the discription of the movie. After that there is the scene of the some sort of festival, where the sister of the male character attends. The female character from the evil side appears at the festival, scaring them all and warning them of the damages she will cause. I think she had a nickname of something similar to ""Bloodthirsty"". After that she leaves and the sister contacts the cat-uncle. Please help me. \*\^\*	Looking for a 2D animated fantasy film The animated movie started with a description of a magical beings.

His parents take him to a rehabilitation center where he stays in a wheelchair. These are few scenes that I remember: "" Meets a girl who becomes his caretaker, and he falls in love with her "" Participates in group theater or reciting classes, including a scene where he blows air on her back and she pretends to be pushed forward "" Becomes friends with another guy who is nonverbal and communicates through a voice tablet. There was this very funny scene where the protagonist uses this tables to say few vulgar sentences and bad words. "" Has a touching/funny scene where they throw special rocks stored in a diaper into a lake or river "" Finds out at the end that the girl has a boyfriend while he pretends to need help from her to get into his chair, which makes him feel hurt and isolated Any help would be appreciated  Ive been trying to find this movie for years!

1lhukcp	Espionage/thriller I can only remember a few scenes from.	Movie is from 2000s or 2010s that has people held prisoner in a camp in the jungle, many of them are medical professionals, and when they are found there are trenches dug with mass graves. They were being held by a rebel leader in some place in the Caribbean or similar setting. The leader is betrayed by a woman and he murders her. I think she was a spy. It involves the CIA, and I want to say based on a true story. I think what Im remembering was only part of the plot. It seems like there was a lot more going on, and this part was just sort of a subplot. I could be wrong though.	Espionage/thriller I can only remember a few scenes from.

The story is about a red motorcycle that comes to life and talks to a boy who owns it.

In the end, the motorcycle falls into a large hole and loses its life, becoming just a regular motorcycle.

Al final, la motocicleta cae en un gran agujero y pierde la vida, convirtiéndose en una motocicleta normal.

One of them hits the Gardner to try and knock him out but fail and the whole scene was just so funny. I know this isnt much of a description but I figured it would be my best bet.

1l6vvto	Malaysian film where fat is the beauty standard	Ive been trying to find a Malaysian film from one of those videos that describes the entire plot of a film from start to finish while showing clips from it (specifically this video: https://youtu.be/__n0ZNw0fk8?si=pOrEPaYfBOWAoWix ). Its set in a world where fat is the beauty standard and thin people are marginalized. It shows how the female main character is affected by the pressure to be fat and how she tries to gain weight even though its detrimental to her health. Presumably its meant to be a satire of real-world beauty standards. The description says the name of the film is BE4UT1FUL W0RLD, and Ive looked for that and Beautiful World, but can only find a K-drama with a very different plot. Literally the only info I can find about this film is from this one video.	Malaysian film where fat is the beauty standard Ive been trying to find a Malaysian film from one of those videos that describes the entire plot of a film from start to finish while showing clips from it (specifically this video: https://youtu.be/__n0ZNw0fk8?si=pOrEPaYfBOWAoWix ). Its set in a world where fat is the beauty standard and thin people are marginalized. It shows how the female main character is affected by the pressure to be fat and how she tries to gain weight even though its detrimental to her health. Presumably its meant to be a satire of real-world beauty standards.

1ljix2a	Obscure 1990'es apocalyptic/adventure movie	The protagonist is a young boy aged 8-12. He lives with his mother and a dog. Something happens to the Sun, and the **sunlight on Earth goes purple/lilac**. Boy and his dog are on the race against time to retrieve some golden crystals and return them to the Sun. Yeah, I know it sounds weird. Or else, the life on Earth will be doomed. While in the process of searching for the crystals, the boy and the dog encounter raiders, robbers and anarchists. In the end, the boy and the dog end up in some vortex and return the sun crystals, but have to sacrifice their lives in the process to save humanity. The last frame of the film is that of the boy's mom, whose eyes are finally green despite being lit by the purple light, which is soon replaced by normal sunlight. The end. Also I believe the film had some mystic and magical elements, given the whole sun crystals and the vortex thing. Please help me find it, I've been looking for it for over 20 years!

1lg5xgr	Movie about killer apes	I saw a movie on TV about 20 years ago and it is probably older than that. I can hardly remember the plot and don't want to give too many details because I might mix things up. What I remember is one scene where two people from the group get a hand-cranked Gatling Gun and fight the killer apes (I believe they where in a desert hill looking area or so) I've done some research and found the following films. I only watched trailers and looked at the screenshots, but none of those seem to be what I am looking for at first glance: * Congo 1995 * Shakma 1990 * Primal Force 1999 * A\*P\*E 1976 * Bloodmonkey 2006 * Monkey Shines 1988 * In the Shadow of Kilimanjaro 1985 * and ofc not Planet of the Apes	Movie about killer apes I saw a movie on TV about 20 years ago and it is probably older than that.

1l4sl8f	Saw This Erotic Movie on HBO Pakistan Around 2004  Cant Remember the Name	Im trying to find the name of a softcore erotic film I watched on HBO in Pakistan, likely in October or November of 2003 or 2004, around 35 AM, during Ramadan. It was an English-language film with modern settings, a casual tone, and felt like something in the vein of Red Shoe Diaries or Emmanuelle  sensual but not explicit. There was no graphic sex or full frontal nudity  just breasts, butts, and softcore erotic scenes. Here are the two main scenes I remember vividly: =4 Scene 1  Red Lingerie, Whipped Cream, Voyeurism A woman is first shown coming out of the shower. She walks into her wardrobe and puts on red bra and red panties. She calls another woman (a friend or guest) to her room. Then, her boyfriend or lover arrives, and they start making out on the bed. He uses a tube or can of whipped cream, which he applies on her breasts, nipples, and stomach, then licks it off. The woman is giggling during the scene, and it has a playful tone. Meanwhile, the second woman is on a sofa, watching them: Shes sitting with her back resting on one arm of the sofa, and her legs stretched over the opposite arm. Her pants are down to her thighs, and she has one hand in her panties, clearly aroused. After the couple finishes and the man gets up to leave, he glances at the woman on the sofa. She looks back at him  they exchange a loaded, silent glance, and then he leaves. =4 Scene 2  Office Sex, Suspicious Colleague In a later scene, a woman is in an office setting with a man. The man is fully dressed, sitting on a sofa or office chair, but his pants are pulled down to his thighs. The woman is sitting on his lap with her back facing him. He takes off her blouse, and they engage in sex in that position. After the encounter, the woman gets dressed again and resumes her office work. A different male colleague enters and starts talking to her. During the conversation, he notices that her blouse is buttoned incorrectly, especially at the collar/neck, and becomes suspicious.  Other Key Points: It was not a full-on porn film  no penetration or explicit genitals shown. Had a light, sexy, casual vibe, not emotional or serious. Definitely not: Suburban Secrets, Behind Bedroom Doors, Fashionistas, Wild Orchid, Emanuelle, or any HBO Original Movie from 20032004. Very likely a licensed erotic film that aired during HBO's late-night adult slot. If this sounds familiar to anyone  the plot, vibe, actors, or even studio  Id be incredibly grateful for any lead. This scene has stuck with me for two decades now, and Id love to finally put a name to it. Thanks in advance!

1km8yod	Help for an animated film	Hi! I would need a hand to find this animated film, but it's been 17 years and I was 5 at the time = so what I remember might be a little distorted. Let's get started: I remember the beginning of the movie was set in the real world, where this farmers family was looking for a way to organize themselves and escape from an impending flood (I THINK, I don't know). The protagonist then, a ragged boy (important detail hahaha I remember he was all dirty), goes to bed worried that he won't even find the foundations of the house. In the morning he wakes up and he is no longer a boy in the human world but he is in this dark world and it has become a cartoon, I think the colors were mainly reddish and with dark tones. Here my memories stop, I have no more ideas of the plot except for some other details that could perhaps help, but I saw it in Italy and I hope it hadn't undergone cuts or changes. so here are some details that I remember vividly: - there was definitely a dark lord, it looked to me like a strange elongated shape that sat on the throne of his castle. - I also think there were some kind of sentries, I remember the owls but I probably just changed my memory - I remember this specific detail well but I wouldn't want to have combined two films, in any case there were some old ladies i think (always in the form of an imaginary character, I don't know what species they were) and I remember them embroidering, it made me laugh as a child that they were facing each other and passing the needle to each other. and stop, I've been racking my brains for years to find it!

1lgtzgr	A chinese drama or reel	can you help me find the chinese drama or reels with this plot: a woman was reborn and the empress takes her in to serve as her replacement or substitute during dates with the prince/emperor. the replacement is good at dancing and the emperor somehow notices that there is a difference between the brides she meets at morning and at night. the fake or sub empress gets pregnant so the mother of the real empress favors her. the ending goes like this: the real empress applies a cream that ruins her face and the fake bride actually ended up taking her place. she also exposed the corruption of the father and the emperor said he knows the truth all along due to the pendant he left her with.

1khgylg	Help me name this missing person/murder mystery movie/series PLEASE	So Im looking for this series, I dont remember all the details so apologies for that. But Im pretty sure its a series, and Im 95% sure it was a Spanish or other language just dubbed in English, where a girl Im pretty sure is called Lia like finds a way to travel back through time I believe in maybe the 80s if that makes sense? I cant remember how , anyway she becomes friends with her parents when they were young and becomes apart of the group/ band with her parents friends, because there also like a band I guess. any way, i believe the aim of her going back in time was to solve a missing persons case from someone in that group that went missing, the guy who went missing in the friend group I just remember him having really long curly black hair . At the end of the series I believe she found his skeletal remains in her current year thats she actually lives in . Surely someone would have had to watch this to, I cant find it anywhere. I could be wrong but I think some significant details in the movie are like the main characters who I think is named Lia discovers her mum was in love with the guy who went missing and there was maybe a cheating scandal where they kissed in a body of water and rocks. I also remember her going to a record/photo developing store a lot so thats a significant part of the movie. I could be wrong but thats all I remember, but if you recognise this please tell me what its called!! Dying to watch it again!! :)	Help me name this missing person/murder mystery movie/series PLEASE So Im looking for this series, I dont remember all the details so apologies for that.

It starts with a woman's body being found burned, and at the end, shows that she was picked up by another woman, and she is murdered because she had an affair with her husband? Then I remember the one who kills her burning her body and she takes off her shirt, breasts exposed. Again, sorry I don't have much more to add to this, but any help is much appreciated!

1lhcnpa	French mystery (?)	Hi, Can anyone possibly help with the name for this movie? It is a French movie that I saw about 10-15 years ago, and I can't remember the name of it. I only vaguely remember that it was about a woman who was either trying to get away from a man who was set to kill her - or to follow and confront him. There may have been some letter that convinced her she had to go on this journey. She met random people who would tell her strange things. There were many strange monologues and mysterious conversations, and I think I remember they revolved around some elusive person no one seemed to know much about. There was one particular scene the visual of which I remember almost exactly. The woman comes into the apartment. There is a sense of being tired of fear. Room with big farmhouse table with no table cloth and nothing on it but placed in a center a clear glass plate with halved pear or two. Soft, quiet light is falling on a plate. Everything else is in the warm shadows, including a man sitting at the table. He is calmly cutting a pear in half with a paring knife with a wooden handle. He does not talk. The woman sits at the table across from him. He finishes cutting the pear and places the pieces and the knife on a plate. The still life with pears looks very Rembrandt-like with the colors, and light and shadow contrast. I was captivated by the movie, and, particularly, that scene with the still life, but for the life of me, I can't remember the name. Thank you	French mystery (?)

1ld8j1u	Late 90s, new wave, Dutch/Turkish language art film about a quiet boy from a poor Turkish refugee family in the Netherlands	Possibly early 00s. I think it's mostly in Dutch (could be German) and Turkish. The little boy doesn't speak at all, either due to shyness or because he's taken a vow of silence in protest to having had to move suddenly to Holland or sth like that. So there's little dialogue, as the film follows this kid struggling to adapt to his new life. Spends most of his time at home doing chores, with his mum and baby sister, as they don't know the new language, while the father's out looking for work to make ends meet. Loner at school. Poor, dirty clothes. Never speaks up. In one scene he gets a NOSEBLEED, due to a fall or sth, and his classmate, a little girl, gives him her HANDKERCHIEF, which he returns later, washed and clean. Yada yada yada... the film ends with a FOOTBALL MATCH (soccer) at school, where he plays and has fun with the other kids. =%	Late 90s, new wave, Dutch/Turkish language art film about a quiet boy from a poor Turkish refugee family in the Netherlands Possibly early 00s.

1lb1dma	Horror movie chase scene	As a little kid, I watched this horror movie my dad put on. I only remember a few parts. This was back when TV had cable. I had Dish TV, and I remember the Syfy network aired a lot of scary movies, but this one stuck with me because I only saw the middle half of it. Here are the details I can remember: More than two killers (I think) are hunting a dad (or maybe a guardian), two girls, and possibly another person, trying to rescue a baby girl who was only a few months old. These killers looked like rednecks or hillbilliesdistorted, kinda like the characters from the Wrong Turn series. I remember an abandoned house or neighborhood, and it was daylight when the rescue mission started. The dad had cracked glasses and broken fingers (some might have been sliced off) and I think he had either a shotgun or a pistol. He peeked through a window in the abandoned house and spotted a killer walking around. He also heard the baby crying. I think there was a little girl trying to calm the baby down, and they decided to escape. The little girl seemed mute or barely talked during the ending. He spotted a trailer, and I think they got caught. They quickly barricaded the door and taped matches at the bottom of it to spark a fire. Then he turned the gas stove on full blast, escaped out a trailer window with the kids, and ran as fast as possible. The killer opened the door, and the trailer exploded. The explosion made a loud noise, so they ran all the way up a mountain. Another killer, armed with a crossbow or bow and arrow, started chasing them. At some point, the killer threatened, You better bring that baby back, or something like that. The little girl looked scared, so they kept going. The protagonist told the others to either hide or go ahead because he was too weak. He got trapped, tried to defend himself, and got hurt worse. Then the little girl returned and either helped with a weapon or distracted the killerIm not sure. The protagonist found a gun on the floor, started shooting, and killed the killer. They were relieved it was finally over and went home or something. Then the credits rolled. If anyone can help identify this horror movie I watched a few times thats stuck in my head at 12 am1 am, Id really appreciate it.

1lbtphh	About a quiet boy from a Turkish family of refugees in the Netherlands, ends with a football match at his school	Late 90s (possibly early 00s) new wave, art film about a quiet boy and his poor Turkish family seeking refuge in the Netherlands (could be Germany). Foreign language film. I think its mostly in Dutch (maybe German), and Turkish (or Kurdish). As far as I remember, the quiet little boy takes a vow of silence in protest and frustration of having had to move suddenly to the Netherlands, leaving his friends and their way of life behind (perhaps). So theres little dialogue, as the film follows this kid struggling to adapt to his new life. I remember the boy doesnt ever speak up in his new school, and is a loner. Poor dirty clothes.

Help me find this film please!!!!!	About a quiet boy from a Turkish family of refugees in the Netherlands, ends with a football match at his school Late 90s (possibly early 00s) new wave, art film about a quiet boy and his poor Turkish family seeking refuge in the Netherlands (could be Germany). Foreign language film. I think its mostly in Dutch (maybe German), and Turkish (or Kurdish). As far as I remember, the quiet little boy takes a vow of silence in protest and frustration of having had to move suddenly to the Netherlands, leaving his friends and their way of life behind (perhaps). So theres little dialogue, as the film follows this kid struggling to adapt to his new life. I remember the boy doesnt ever speak up in his new school, and is a loner. Poor dirty clothes.

1kco6c1	Horror movie	I'm trying to remember the title of a movie that seems to be set after 2005. It starts with a family of four or five in a silver or blue vehicle, who nearly crash but manage to dodge it.

I HAVE to spoil the ending cause it's something I remember and I'm sure it can help me find the film)	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	1	46	1043	1090	10	205	215	1.572727272727274	4.568478964401297	4.6637403993855635	1	NA	NA	0	NA	NA	NA	1	1
1leb5v5	What cgi animated movie had a bee and grasshopper fall in love? It was a kids movie, and may have been a remake or at least inspired by Mr. Bug Goes to Town.	EDIT: This was the movie: Tall Tales from the Magical Garden of Antoon Krings (Drôles de petites bêtes, 2017) I very randomly was reminded of a movie I had found it on amazon a while back, and now Im searching for an answer, because I cant find proof it exists anymore. Heres what I remember: Edit: It is definitely not Maya the Bee, or any of Mayas later films. I think that the story may have described itself as being based off of a fable? \- I think the movie poster had a bee and grasshopper sitting on a flower or something similar at night time and the cgi for the movie was pretty decent. Definitely a step above from some really low effort kids movies. \- From what I can recall from the plot, there were around three main characters, who were: a kind queen bee, a little girl bee, and a grasshopper. They lived in a small hive town in the grass, there was probably a villain, and I think the grasshopper was poor and maybe played a fiddle. At the very end of the story, (Out of respect for this subs rules, Ive marked this as a spoiler, even though I really dont think anyone will care, lol), &gt;!the little girl bee takes the queens place, and the former bee queen lives happily ever after with the grasshopper.!&lt; Thanks for any help on this.

The evil entity makes the kids go missing one by one and causes them to hallucinate by seeing ghosts. there's an old swimming pool that has no water outside where they saw a ghost of a child. I saw it in earlier 2000s and it might have been a foreign movie.	Whats the name?

In the final scene, hes expecting a client but its actually his wife or ex, dressed up, surprising him for a scheduled time together. They seemed estranged earlier in the film, and this is a romantic/sexy resolution. The planes a small twin prop, maybe with a curtained bed area in the back. Probably Hollywood, not older than 30 years. I cant recall actors or exact plot. May have been a subplot. Any ideas?

1lg717j	70s I think	I was at a family Christmas party in the mid 80s and an older cousin was kind of channel surfing and stopped on this movie a couple of times and at the time it had some of the most disturbing scenes I had seen, I was about 10. The movie was gritty and in a large city (maybe new york), maybe based around an apartment complex. One scene an old woman answers her door and a robber bust in and robs/attacks her I think. Her husband runs out and chases after the guy, and she shuts the door. He ends up banging on the door to get back in but she's scared and when she finally does her husband is dead. The second scene a young woman was babysitting(?) a young Asian kid and as they are entering the building someone charged in behind them to grape her. As bad as that is I remember her trying to protect the kid she was watching, telling him to leave when she felt the out come was inevitable, her telling him to leave while be attacked was really hard on my brain at that age.	70s I think I was at a family Christmas party in the mid 80s and an older cousin was kind of channel surfing and stopped on this movie a couple of times and at the time it had some of the most disturbing scenes I had seen, I was about 10.

1lcg6uz	Can you help me name the movie from this obscure scene description	My brother has a tune stuck in his head from (he thinks) an animated movie we watched while we were kids. For context, he was born in 95 and we are only a few years apart. He described the scene as below: A prince-like man, or just a sort of strong man figure, is essentially like skipping through the woods whistling/humming/singing a tune. An animal starts to sing back at him, and they go back and forth for a while. Then, he like kills the small animal or the animal suddenly dies. Again, this is a kids movie, so it was likely meant to be sort of funny  not horrific. Any ideas what it could be from??? I know its not a lot to go on.

The kids run over a rise or hill and spot only what I can guess are soldiers or some sort of bad guys. The soldiers are wearing like these tall round hats with tassles. The kids return home and warn the family. The whole family goes to hide in a basement or cellar. The soldiers enter and look around. One of the family members either is discovered or screams and a fight ensues. The soldiers end up massacring the family. I think maybe one or two of the family escape. I saw this movie maybe in the late 70's. The movie was in color. I'm not even sure I saw the whole movie, but this scene is burned in my mind. Ring a bell to anyone?

1l5pu6u	Trying to find this movie for years to watch again to no avail! PLEASE HELP	The film was a British independent drama. The plot involved three siblings, two boys and one girl, living alone in a small apartment after their mother dies and I believe to keep from getting taken from authorities they keep it a secret. In a key scene, the youngest boy climbs onto a stool, falls off, and breaks his neck. The older brother then buries his body to keep their situation hidden. The film had a bleak, realistic tone, and was likely made in the late 1990s or early 2000s. It was not a widely released film, and may have been a student film or a festival-only indie. I saw this at the UINLV college for a Sundance film screening I believe.	Trying to find this movie for years to watch again to no avail! PLEASE HELP The film was a British independent drama.

1kdf20s	Found footage horror w/ alien creatures poss spoiler of ending if that was the end of movie.	It was early 2000s when i watched this movie maybe 2006 to like 2009 for possible time frame. Couldve been on older syfy network. The movie followed a man and a woman either siblings or couple/friends who were recording themselves in a foreign country possibly Japan or France Im not sure. The two people speak English for sure but I cant remember the other language. Then these monsters start showing up and destroying everything, a scene I remember is theyre distraught and run into the street with concrete walls kinda off to each side with like the circle hole design towards the top of them like to separate a yard or store from the road or another building etc and the monsters arm looking like a tentacle/octopus arm slams onto the building and fence into the street and the footage cuts out. Its all I can remember and it drives me absolutely crazy each time it randomly comes to mind throughout the years.

Here's the most distinct scene I remember: - A middle-aged man, short and slightly balding, is in what seems like a lab or exhibition room. - He opens a curtain to reveal a machine (unclear what it does). - A group of reportersmostly East Asianstart taking photos excitedly. - The man gets upset and says ""No photo!"" in English (with a non-American, non-British accent). - He then takes one of the reporters cameras and throws it into a large metal drum filled with a bright green liquid. - Thats itI don't recall what happens before/after. **Additional info:** - Its definitely a comedy. - Dialogue is in English, but spoken with a non-native accent (possibly European). - No famous actorslikely a foreign production (European or Asian) trying English-language comedy.

1k4qozs	Joe &amp; A Girl? (2010s?)	Scrolling through TikTok and came across a clip from a movie but couldn't find anything to identify the film, it's really bugging me so I am hoping someone can help. There's a kid called Joey who tells a girl neighbour he is going to marry her which she finds creepy and tells him to stay away from her. Later we find them hanging out in a shed or outhouse where they are getting to know one another and he asks her if praying really works. She replies I hope so before asking what happened to his eye. He tells her that his sister threw a Barbie doll at him but it doesn't hurt. Jump to sometime later and he finds out he is being moved on from his foster home having been suspended from school for fighting and expelled. The girl hands him a scarf as a farewell gift and apologises about the colour to which he reponds that he likes the colour and that she should wait for him as he will find her, like he said, he wants to marry her. Stupidly lost the original video and can't find it again, was hoping someone might be able to help.	Joe &amp; A Girl? (2010s?)

1lj9c1k	Asian movie with a killing umbrella/peisan that I remember seeing as a kid in the early 2000s	Hi! I'm looking for a movie that I have tried to find from time to time for the last 10 years. Like an hyper fixation for a couple days, then forgetting about it for a year or two after finding nothing. It's a movie that I remember my father was watching when I was 8 years old at most, so it had to be released before 2004. He doesn't remember watching a film like that so he wasn't able to help me. I didn't see much about it, all I can recall is a fight scene in which (I think) a woman beheads another person with an iron umbrella quickly closing and opening it, and lots of blood coming out of the beheaded torso. I'm not sure if it was about samurais but it's very likely since my father always loved that genre. I'm not entirely sure but very certain it was filmed in black and white but I don't think it was very old for that time, more like a homage to Kurosawa's movies. Maybe it's from the 1990s or early 2000s. All I could find is a movie called Shadow from 2019 in which a weapon called peisan is used by one of the characters, and it's very similar to the memory of the umbrella I have in mind. If anyone can think of a movie that fits please share it with me, and if you can link a video with a fight scene that fits my description, the better. Thanks a lot in advance!

Its one of those cliche movies where the guy and girl are best friends and the guy is in love with her but she doesnt know it. Everything Ive googled keeps giving me Employee of the Month as my answer but Im positive it wasnt that movie. The main girl was brunette and the main guy was somebody that I remember looking similar to James Norton or Zach Gilford. One specific part of the movie I remember is that the girl was attracted to and trying to impress her neighbor. Another detail I remember is the guy and girl sitting in the grocery store after hours talking and hanging out and I think she puts her feet on him during that conversation.

At the end of the movie the older sister (or maybe it was her friend) sees new hot young sister and so does her boyfriend and they're shocked.

1l8d56p	Suche Horrorfilm (oder Serie), in dem ein Mädchen ihre Schwester nach Streit um eine Puppe mit einem Messer ersticht (deutsch, ca. 20102015 gesehen)	Hi zusammen, ich suche schon lange nach einem Film oder einer Serienepisode, die ich vor ca. 1015 Jahren spätabends im deutschen Fernsehen gesehen habe (vermutlich zwischen 2010 und 2015). Ich habe nur den Anfang (oder eine Szene direkt nach einer Werbepause) gesehen. Was ich 100/% weiß: Zwei Mädchen, etwa 10 Jahre alt, streiten sich um eine Puppe (vielleicht eine Barbie oder Ähnliches). Eine sagt sowas wie: Das ist meine Puppe! Sie zerren an der Puppe, bis sie kaputtgeht. Danach geht eines der Mädchen zur Küchenschublade, holt ein Messer raus und sticht ihre Schwester ab. Die Szene spielt in einer Küche, Mutter sitzt glaube ich mit am Tisch. Es lief definitiv auf Deutsch (ob Synchronfassung oder deutscher Film weiß ich nicht). Vor dem Beitrag kam eine Warnung: Nicht für Kinder geeignet oder so ähnlich. Könnte auf Super RTL, Nickelodeon, Disney Channel, RTL oder einem anderen Sender gelaufen sein, der sonst eher Kinder- oder Familienprogramm zeigt  aber eben spät abends (ca. 23 Uhr). Ich bin mir nicht sicher, ob es der Anfang eines Films, einer Serie oder ein Rückblick war. Es könnte auch eine Anthologie- oder Kurzfilmreihe gewesen sein. Ich erinnere mich an keine Titel, keine Musik und keine Namen  nur diese Szene. Wäre mega dankbar, wenn jemand das wiedererkennt oder einen Tipp hat!

Was ich 100/% weiß: Zwei Mädchen, etwa 10 Jahre alt, streiten sich um eine Puppe (vielleicht eine Barbie oder Ähnliches). Eine sagt sowas wie: Das ist meine Puppe! Sie zerren an der Puppe, bis sie kaputtgeht. Danach geht eines der Mädchen zur Küchenschublade, holt ein Messer raus und sticht ihre Schwester ab. Die Szene spielt in einer Küche, Mutter sitzt glaube ich mit am Tisch. Es lief definitiv auf Deutsch (ob Synchronfassung oder deutscher Film weiß ich nicht). Vor dem Beitrag kam eine Warnung: Nicht für Kinder geeignet oder so ähnlich. Könnte auf Super RTL, Nickelodeon, Disney Channel, RTL oder einem anderen Sender gelaufen sein, der sonst eher Kinder- oder Familienprogramm zeigt  aber eben spät abends (ca. 23 Uhr). Ich bin mir nicht sicher, ob es der Anfang eines Films, einer Serie oder ein Rückblick war. Es könnte auch eine Anthologie- oder Kurzfilmreihe gewesen sein. Ich erinnere mich an keine Titel, keine Musik und keine Namen  nur diese Szene. Wäre mega dankbar, wenn jemand das wiedererkennt oder einen Tipp hat!

1lcg7yq	Cartoon Short from 80s	I believe this is from the 80s, possibly an MTV short? Its a dark comedy. Theres a giant robot attacking a city that kills a generic looking super hero before he can help. A boy then takes over to fight the robot. He eventually opens a panel on the robots head to find its controlled by a cockroach, who he squishes. Searched online but no luck finding it. Anyone remember seeing this way back when?

1l8af69	These are your new parents""	Or something like that sentence. I remember this movie in which this couple (which I believe are the parents of this kid, though I'm not certain) introduces this little boy to another couple and tell him ""These are your new parents"", or something like that. Fast forward, the foster father is washing the kid in a bathtub with his clothes still on, and as such the child starts crying. The foster mother suggests that he stops washing him because he's scaring him. Fast forward again and it's obvious that this couple is facing issues, and the man (possibly the woman, not too sure) is an alcoholist and in this scene he smashes a glass bottle (likely alcohol) in the kitchen as he cries, and the woman hugs him. Many of these details could be wrong, but it's already a lot if I managed to recall these scenes, since it aired in the 2000s (at most, in the first years of the 2010s).

1l9b8gu	Looking for an old indie LGBT movie with non-linear storytelling	I'm trying to track down an indie LGBT film, probably from the late 1990s or 2000s, that I watched years ago on a streaming platform (though I cant recall which one). The story focuses on the romantic lives of 2 or 3 gay men, likely in their late 20s or early 30s. What really stood out was its unusual narrative structure. Instead of a single, linear plot, the film jumps between timelines/flashbacks/hypothetical scenarios. For instance, one scene might show two characters ending up together, but later it shifts to an alternate outcome, almost like exploring ""what if"" versions of their lives. It had a very emotional and introspective tone, playing with the notions of memory, choice and possibility.

1lexxtz	Anime from the 60s-70s	This was something that used to run on Nickelodeon, back in the mid 80s. It was an anime kinda in the Yamamoto style. Humanity is spread among the stars, in different systems named for constellations/ mythological names(?): there are peaceniks, militarists, etc., They fight amongst themselves, but there is a bigger threat coming after all of them - a sentient robotic race. It's wiping out civilizations and there is little to be done to stop it. Some heroes - I think they're kids(?) band the humans together, but the most militant race says they will defeat the robots; needless to say, they fail. The remnants of the spacefaring civilizations band together at a city enclosed in a bubble trying to rally, they fear the oncoming robots, There is a climactic battle where the last of the militant race appear and help even the odds, but the robots are stopped by the actions of the heroes, not the armadas. Any ideas? TIA!	Anime from the 60s-70s This was something that used to run on Nickelodeon, back in the mid 80s. It was an anime kinda in the Yamamoto style.

Two crimnals come to the door (dad and son maybe?) loooking to hide out. They connect with the daughter and find out how closed off she is. At the end of the movie it is revealed that the mother lost her original family in a car crash and kidnapped the other husband and daughter and keeps the original wife on a hospital bed watching the house on the cameras to torture her. At the end I think the criminals take place in the hosptila bed well she looks after the son.	Horro movie The plot of the movie is a mother keeping her daughter isolated in the country.

1larikh	Looking for movie	Hi everyone! Im hoping someone can help me find an old movie I watched as a teenager on VHS, but I havent been able to track down for years. Heres what I remember about the movie: Its a comedy featuring an African American cast. A single dad with two daughters (no mother around). The older daughter goes on her first date, and the dad gives her strict rules for the evening. The dad secretly follows her and her date throughout the night  from their home, to a restaurant, and even on a boat. Theres a scene in a bathroom and some involving a dog. At the end, everyone finds out the dad was following them and breaking the rules he set himself. The setting feels like a small town with music and a party atmosphere. The movie is from the 80s or 90s. If anyone knows the name of this movie or has any info, Id be so grateful!	Looking for movie Hi everyone!

The boyfriend cheats on the woman I think? and I think the 2nd male is conflicted about telling her or not.	Name that movie All morning I've been thinking about this movie.

1lhi029	I need help identifying an old Asian movie aired on Philippine TV	Im trying to find the title of a Asian movie I watched on Philippine free TV sometime between 20102019, possibly on ABS-CBN or GMA. It was dubbed in Tagalog. Heres what I remember: ûThe story is about two sisters living in a Japanese apartment. ûOne day, some men broke into their apartment. The older sister was raped, and the younger sister hid in the bathroom or a cabinet. ûYears later, the older sister is in a hospital or care home, supposedly with the mental capacity of a child due to trauma. ûThe younger sister works and studies to support both of them and also has a love interest, but she cant fully commit because of her responsibilities. ûThe hospital staff secretly know that the older sister is faking her mental condition, but the younger sister doesn't know. ûIn the final scene, the truth is revealed during a confrontation between the sisters near a hill or pond by the hospital. ûThe film had a blue-toned or grayish color palette, and I remember seeing train scenes, which makes me think it was set in Japan. ûThere were no graphic or mature scenesit focused more on the emotional and psychological aspects. The title might have been left untranslated or was in English, not a full Tagalog title. If anyone remembers this film or saw it on TV during that time, Id appreciate any help identifying it!

1l4ooug	Small Indie Movie	I'm trying to remember the name of this small Indie film from somewhere around 2010-2020. It was about a woman who I think gets divorced at the beginning of the movie and moves back to her hometown. She becomes a high school teacher and gets involved with a student. There is a scene I remember where she meets the student in a laundromat and she is wearing her old high school cheer uniform. I know it sounds it bit like a fever dream as I describe it, but I think I did see this movie and I can't remember the name.

1l6bssb	Vintage movie name	Hi all, Im trying to identify an old adult movie I watched many years ago  likely from the 1980s or early 90s. It had a full storyline, not just scenes. I believe it was French or European (though Im not sure). What I remember about the plot: "" A group/gang of people targets women by tricking them. "" One man in the gang fakes romantic interest in a woman and takes her to his house. "" During sex, a group of black-masked intruders break in and sexually assault the woman. "" Among the intruders, a female member also has sex with the man. "" The woman becomes suspicious of the setup later. "" She hires a spy woman, who pretends to fall in love with the same man to investigate. "" A similar setup happens to her, but this time she figures it out and exposes the gang. "" The whole gang is eventually arrested. "" I think the spys sex scene was shown at the start of the movie. "" The man was hairy, had a mustache, and the woman was well-off or wealthy. This wasnt just a single scene  it had a narrative arc, almost like an erotic thriller with adult content. Ive looked everywhere but havent been able to find it. If this rings a bell, Id really appreciate your help! Thanks in advance.

At one point he's with a blonde girl and they go to a club or something and they start fooling around in a bathroom stall, then a security guard or bouncer knocks on the door and they come out. The guard says something along the lines of ""as a man I congratulate you, but as a guard-"" and knocks him out. Then at the end he goes back in time and doesn't talk to the girl therefore preventing the events of the entire movie. I think the toxic girls name was Romona or something and she had red hair maybe.

1kp63gr	Can't Find this Movie/Show, and Only Remember One Scene	Roughly 15 to 20 years ago, younger me was aimlessly watching television when a scene came on that embedded itself in my brain. What I remember from the scene is it has 2 people, a man and a woman, who become remotely strapped to their chairs by another man, potentially the antagonist. The conversation they were initially having seemed pleasant until the surprise restraints. Next, a drill slowly rises from the man's chair and impaled him in the chest as he and the woman scream. I'm not sure if this is a movie or a show, and I'm sorry I dont have anymore details to share, but if someone can identify where this scene came from, it would be greatly appreciated.

I only remember one part of it where a woman with shorter hair came in to a room and held a human skull upside down, spoke into it and then put it back down and left in a hurry. The room seemed like a mud hut and the floor looked sandy.

The outside of the home is crappy. Its in this crappy, squished neighborhood with junk. Theyre kind of like these wooden townhouses. A car pulls up, a man walks out and is searching for the man in the attic; the owner of the house lies. Thats as much as I can remember. The cinematography has a beige and white aesthetic. I watched this movie between 2018 and 2020, but it may have been released earlier. I think it was in English and in color.

1k8nd88	Finding old forgotten kids movie	Hi guys, I drastically need your help. I vaguely remember this movie I seen when I was a kid back possibly between 2005-2013 and I can't remember much but here is what I do remember; A young boy finds this like creature who I think looked like the old style sugar puffs monster from the cereal back in the early 2000s. He found that similar looking monster in his shed and they become friends. For some reason I think he fed it like peanut butter and jelly or something like that. Then possibly there was a scene where the creature showed up at the boys elementary school and the boy rushed to bring it back to the shed? This is literally nothing to work with and so vague but I've been wracking my brain about this all day and ChatGPT can't figure it out at all. Please Help Me!

1la888l	I need help finding this 3D animated movie	I dont remember the plot, But i do remember two scenes from this movie, i remembered the character designs too except the third main character if she was even one, but she was too forgettable, I think the movie begun when I saw this giant buff asian man running to his home or smth, but he saw it burning down in the woods, then next scene the hulk guy was fighting some type of rock or robot monster it was either of those, on a floating spherical platform something like youd see on mario galaxy, and next i saw them in some kind of void or big cave and the scrawny overbite kid was arguing with the buff dude, its style was something like Kevin munroes tmnt (2007), at least I THINK its 3d, do you guys have any familiarity with the sketches/info?

1kiiahn	Ive Finally Found the BEST IPTV Providers in 2025  No More Buffering, No More Scams (Full Review)	If youve been searching high and low for the **BEST IPTV** service in 2025, I can honestly sayIve been right there with you. Ive spent years testing, subscribing, getting disappointed, getting scammed, buffering my way through major events, and dealing with services that vanish overnight. The world of IPTV is wild. But after going through nearly every possible option, Ive landed on four IPTV providers that consistently perform at the top. No buffering, reliable support, and massive content libraries. In this post, Ill walk you through my real-world experience with each of them so you can decide which might be the **best IPTV provider** for your needs. # What Is IPTV and Why Everyones Searching for the BEST IPTV Provider Before diving into the reviews, lets be clear: **IPTV (Internet Protocol Television)** is a streaming method that delivers live TV and on-demand content over the internet. Its gained huge popularity because it offers better content, more flexibility, and lower prices than traditional cable. But not all IPTV services are created equal. Some are packed with features but are terribly unstable. Others have great uptime but weak channel selection. Finding the **best IPTV service** means balancing quality, reliability, support, and price. # My Criteria for Choosing the BEST IPTV Services in 2025 Before recommending anything, Ive tested over 40 providers. My benchmarks included: * **Uptime and server stability** (Does the service crash during big events?) * **Buffering and stream quality** (Is it smooth on 1080p and 4K?) * **Channel variety** (USA, UK, Sports, PPV, Arabic, French, Latino, etc.) * **Video On Demand (VOD)** library * **Device compatibility** (Firestick, Smart TV, MAG, Android, iOS, etc.) * **Customer support response time** * **Pricing &amp; free trial options** * **Account security &amp; consistency** Now that you know what I looked for, here are the top IPTV services that made the cut. #  1. SkyHub4K  The Gold Standard of IPTV in 2025 If I had to pick just one service to recommend as the **BEST IPTV** option this year, it would be SkyHub4K. This provider has been a game-changer for me personally. **Heres what makes SkyHub4K stand out:** * **Ultra-stable streams** during major events like the Super Bowl, UFC, or El Clasico. * **Massive channel list**: 20,000+ live channels including USA, UK, French, Arabic, Spanish, German, African, Indian, and more. * **Thousands of VOD titles**, including the latest movies, TV shows, and even classic films. * **Full support for 4K, FHD, and HD**  crisp visuals with no lag. * **PPV and sports coverage** that rarely failsNBA, NFL, UFC, WWE, and boxing events included. * **No freezing**, even on hotel WiFi and mobile hotspots. * **Works on Firestick, Android TV, Smart TVs, MAG, and mobile apps.** **Personal Experience:** Ive been using SkyHub4K for over two years now, and its the only IPTV service Ive renewed continuously. Its the **most reliable IPTV** Ive used during international trips too. The customer support team is fast, and the setup is super beginner-friendly. If you're serious about quality and want the **best IPTV experience**, SkyHub4K is a top contender. #  2. LunoTV  Best IPTV for VOD and User-Friendly Interface LunoTV might not be as flashy as SkyHub4K, but in terms of VOD content and user interface, its seriously impressive. It feels like a hybrid between Netflix and a premium live TV service. **Why LunoTV ranks high:** * **Modern, easy-to-navigate interface** with fast content browsing. * **Large on-demand catalog** with updated movies, series, anime, and kids' content. * **Live TV lineup** covering all the essentials  sports, news, entertainment, international. * **Solid uptime** with little to no downtime or crashes. * **Compatible with all major IPTV players** including Smarters, XCIPTV, and TiviMate. **Ideal For:** If you watch a ton of VOD content and want something that feels smooth and professional, LunoTV is one of the **best IPTV providers** youll come across in 2025. **My Verdict:** Its one of the few providers where I actually find myself browsing the VOD library regularly instead of just sticking to live channels. It works beautifully on Android boxes and Firestick too. #  3. Focus4K  Best IPTV for Sports, PPV, and HD Quality Are you a sports fan? Like, hardcore sports fan? Then Focus4K is going to be your dream come true. This service was clearly built for sports lovers. **Focus4K Highlights:** * **Extensive sports coverage**: NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB, F1, Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Ligue 1, UFC, WWE, and PPV events. * **No extra fees for premium events.** * **Fantastic HD and Full HD quality**, even on lower-speed internet. * **Smooth experience on Smart TVs and streaming devices.** * **Fast channel zapping** and nearly zero buffering during games. **Why Its One of the BEST IPTV Options in 2025:** When I used to rely on cable or free streams, Id miss goals or rounds due to buffering or lag. With Focus4K, I watched the entire 2024 World Cup qualifiers, UFC 300, and even live PPVs without any interruption. If youre mainly in it for the sports, Focus4K is the **best IPTV service for live sports in 2025**, hands down. #  4. IPTVFusionZone  The Rising Star With Killer All-Around Performance IPTVFusionZone is a newer service but its quickly becoming one of the **top IPTV choices** in the community. Its a well-balanced provider that checks all the boxes: stable streams, rich content, and responsive support. **What Youll Like:** * **All major channels in one place**: US, UK, Canada, France, Germany, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, India, and more. * **Surprisingly strong VOD section** that gets updated frequently. * **Clean, minimalist interface** without ads or confusing layouts. * **Fantastic for families**  great mix of kids, news, sports, and general entertainment. * **Supports multiple connections** if you want to share with family or use it across several devices. **Best Use Case:** FusionZone is perfect if youre switching from cable and want an IPTV solution thats stable, clean, and doesnt feel overwhelming. Its a solid all-arounder and may surprise you with its consistency. # Final Thoughts: Which One Is the BEST IPTV Provider for You? Heres a quick breakdown to help you decide: |IPTV Provider|Best For|My Rating (P out of 5)| |:-|:-|:-| |**SkyHub4K**|All-in-one IPTV power, reliability|PPPPP| |**LunoTV**|VOD lovers, modern UI|PPPP½| |**Focus4K**|Hardcore sports fans, PPV|PPPP½| |**IPTVFusionZone**|Family-friendly, clean interface|PPPP| No matter your needssports, movies, international content, or just stable IPTV with no headachesthese four providers have something solid to offer. In 2025, the **BEST IPTV** isnt about having the flashiest interface or the biggest marketing campaign. Its about **stability, value, and consistent quality**, and all four of these providers deliver exactly that. # Frequently Asked Questions About the BEST IPTV Services in 2025 **Q: Are these IPTV providers legal?** A: IPTV legality depends on your country and how the service is structured. Always do your own research and use a VPN for privacy. **Q: Can I watch IPTV on Firestick or Smart TV?** Absolutely. All four of the services above are optimized for Firestick, Android boxes, Smart TVs, and apps like IPTV Smarters or TiviMate. **Q: Do these providers offer trials?** Some offer short trials or 1-day access. Youll need to contact them directly to confirm, but its worth trying before committing. **Q: What internet speed do I need for smooth IPTV streaming?** At least 15 Mbps is ideal for HD content. For 4K, aim for 25 Mbps or higher. If youve been on the hunt for the **best IPTV provider** and are tired of spinning the wheel with sketchy services, I highly recommend giving one of these four a shot. Youll finally be able to watch what you wantwithout interruptions, buffering, or getting ripped off. Let me know what you're currently using and how it's working for you. If you've tried any of these, Id love to hear your experience!

1kgd0d6	What is this Black Mirror-ish movie?	I watched a movie a while back. I think it is foreign (not made in USA). It is about a family who lives in the forest or some kind of ""outcast"" area. The mother actively protests the technology the society uses. She moves to the city where she has a job as a lawyer. She plans to use her job to help bring down the technology company. Meanwhile, her daughter starts the public school and sees that everyone is depended on some kind of tech that I believe is on their wrist. It projects holograms, and has to be installed in their body. The girl feels left out and want it, so she goes through a series of people to find someone who can give her a stolen or bootleg one. He installs it for her, and I think they end up sleeping together. Basically, she leads him on. Later, she ends up outting her mom out and getting her arrested. Has anyone seen this? If it weren't for the fact my husband watched it with you I would think I hallucinated the whole thing.	What is this Black Mirror-ish movie? I watched a movie a while back.

I recall a dramatic movie, with a family (possibly) little girl with a bunch of stuffed animals including a sock puppet similar to the attached photo. I believe it is a live action movie.

1kk4560	Title Please: 1982 Made for TV or Miniseries Set in a remote Canadian town, a mysterious illness spreading after a chemical spill from a derailed train.	ChatGDP suggested ""The Silent Fall"" (not the more recent Silent Fall) but I can't find and trace. The movie was released around the same time as ""The Day After."" The plot is essentially about a very small town where the population come down with a mysterious illness, later discovered to be airborne fumes from a chemical spill from a derailed train. An army officer (policeman/doctor?) visits from a nearby town to assist, but he's aware of the fatal consequences. If I recall, one person didn't catch the disease and they tried to find out why.

1lic7po	Not sure about the genre, but it could be an 80's or 90's movie	Hi, everyone. There's a movie I wanna find, but there's a problem. I only watched a single scene as a kid back in the late 90s. The only thing I have is a description of the scene based on what I remember (which could be skewed given that it's been almost 30 years since I watched the scene), but I wanna give it a try. The scene starts with a blonde woman and a girl going into a grocery store to buy something for the girl. Moments later, a gang of robbers with clown masks and guns/shotguns show up on motorcycles and try to rob the place. The woman and the girl hide, but then the woman tells the girl to stay hidden. She then goes and ambushes the robbers one by one using some martial arts and acrobatics. She finishes off the last robber with one of the shotguns. She leaves the place with the girl, and that's all I remember. I tried looking everywhere for it with no luck. Hope someone here has seen it as well.

1kb38vy	Help finding movie for a friend	Sounds familiar but cant recall. Told her I'd try to help find it ""90s to early 2000s vibes. Mountain/suburban town. A daughter comes home from school to find her moms car in the driveway with the windows down and her purse and the groceries still in the passenger seat with ice cream melting everywhere. She searches but cant find any sign of her, and her father who I believe was home but in his office doesnt know anything. A big point of the movie is the dad is pretty much consumed by work and not mentally present. They report the mother missing and they search for her, the father actually taking time from work to be there and the adult daughter coming back from the city with her bf/husband to be with them. The movie centers around the teen daughter who eventually feels like she is the only one who isnt giving up and is still looking for her mother, while her father seems to be moving on with someone else eventually. Theres also a scene where she is talking with the sisters husband and he lets her kiss him because she's kind of been led on by him. When she brings up being together he's suddenly all uh no your a kid and I have a life in the city and that makes her spiral more. Eventually a woman who knew her mother takes her far out of town to what looked more like a kind of hippy/boho small town that was much less white than where she lived and brings her to a greenhouse shed/trailer where her mother is sitting and making art completely different to how she was before. She tells her mom shes excited to bring her back and they have this emotional talk about how the mother isnt going back to where no one even noticed her most days and everything she did. How she gets everyone including her husband has already moved on and continued life without her and I think calls out the daughter for being the same way and now only caring that shes gone. She couldnt live that way anymore and it was time for her daughter to move on and decide what she wanted in life since she was getting ready to graduate highschool anyway. But she isnt because shes been skipping school this whole time and is about to fail if she doesnt pass the make up tests the school is giving her because of her circumstances. I think she fails anyway and has to learn how to deal with everything.""	Help finding movie for a friend Sounds familiar but cant recall. Told her I'd try to help find it ""90s to early 2000s vibes.

1ldtr7q	please help!	Hi! Im trying to find a movie I watched around 2023. Its a romantic comedy in English, relatively recent, with a light, happy ending. It seemed to be American (not British or Canadian) and might not have been officially released in Brazil, since I watched it through alternative means, not on any streaming platform. Heres what I remember: Two young professionals (around 25 years old) who meet shortly after both breaking up with their exes. The story happens over just a few days, probably over a weekend or holiday. Its set in winter, with lots of snow, and the setting feels like a small town. There are scenes in a fancy place  white, very bright, warm yellow lights, where the male protagonist is wearing a suit. One specific scene: the guys ex refuses to use his toothbrush. Another scene: the two main characters share the same toothbrush, as a cute and intimate gesture. Theres a moment when they ride a kind of sled-taxi (probably a local winter transportation). At some point, theres a power outage, and the guy makes candles using oranges, which really stuck in my memory. Other details: I dont remember any specific soundtrack. It didnt feel like a big blockbuster, but not fully indie either. The tone is light, cozy, cute, and the ending is happy. I would really appreciate any help! This movie has been stuck in my head, and I cant remember the name no matter how hard I try.	please help! Hi! Im trying to find a movie I watched around 2023.

1kcc9g0	Quien??	TW: dead children I watched a movie on my JetBlue flight yesterday. It was a Spanish-language film, from Argentine production companies. Probably made within the last 3 years. It was a long Spanish name, I think it started with ""Qui.."". Maybe quien? It was about a woman named Tamara, who left a cult and is staying with her mother and her sister.

It was a Spanish-language film, from Argentine production companies. Probably made within the last 3 years. It was a long Spanish name, I think it started with ""Qui.."". Maybe quien? It was about a woman named Tamara, who left a cult and is staying with her mother and her sister. The cult leaders name is Raul. There is a missing newborn who was burned alive.

Theres also a scene where a man is at a park, about to light himself on fire, and two female officers stop him. I think in another scene, one female officer gets hit by a car.

I don't know if this subreddit is for that, but I need help finding a movie. I don't remember its name or exactly what the plot was about. I only have a vague memory of having seen it when I was a kid. My only memory is of a specific scene where the protagonist was inside what appeared to be a bunker containing artifacts from myths and legends like Noah's Ark or the Loch Ness Monster and that sort of thing. The protagonist walks away from the place and the movie ends. Does anyone know if this movie is real?

1kdzq7o	The First IPTV Service That Actually Works	After trying a ridiculous number of IPTV providers over the past few years, I was about ready to throw in the towel. It was always the same story: "" Buffering during live sports "" Channels dropping out of nowhere "" Outdated on-demand content that doesnt load "" Zero support when things go wrong "" Sites that vanish without warning Honestly, I figured IPTV just wasnt reliable. Then I found [https://smartsgi.com](https://smartsgi.com), and it completely changed my expectations.  25,000+ live TV channels from around the world  including sports, news, PPV, and premium content  100K+ movies and series  with libraries from platforms like Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, and more  Flawless playback  no buffering, even during high-traffic events  Works with all major devices: Firestick, Android TV, Smart TVs, iOS, MAG boxes, etc.  24/7 live support  and yes, they actually reply  Upfront pricing  no hidden fees, no shady lifetime plans Setup took less than 10 minutes, and Ive had zero issues streaming on both Firestick and Android TV. Everything just works. way cheaper than juggling multiple streaming apps and still missing out on live sports. If youve been burned by unreliable IPTV services like I have, SmartSGI is definitely worth checking out.

1lclt0q	Horror short movie in black and white about a delusional surgeon	Hi! Im looking for an indie Latin American psychological thriller/horror short that Ive seen about 10 years ago. It was hosted for free on a site dedicated to the film, probably made by the director. It was shot in black and white, around 10-15 minutes long, with an unsettling vibe and eerie cool music. I think the title had ~philia in it, maybe referencing a fetish related to surgery or amputation. The story was told from the point of view of a doctor/surgeon who saw himself as a generous, selfless man. He had an MTF trans nurse, a beautiful, cheerful, provocative woman that he called his masterpiece, saying he had done her reassignment and cosmetic surgeries himself. One day, a wounded criminal with a bag of money showed up and threatened him with a gun. The doctor tried to calm him down and offered to help, but the man ended up dead. Other things happened, but I cant remember. (Spoilers from here) The twist was that the doctor wasnt a real surgeon at all. He was a delusional psychopath, maybe a drug addict. The nurse wasnt anything like how he saw her: she looked very masculine and botched from bad surgery, and she hated him because he was threatening to cut off her hormone pills if she ever tried to leave or speak out. The scene with the criminal also played out differently. The man was wounded but not aggressive, he basically handed over the gun willingly. The doctor then shot him and stole his money. Did someone know what Im talking about and ever saw this short?	Horror short movie in black and white about a delusional surgeon Hi!

Did someone know what Im talking about and ever saw this short?	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	1	64	1493	1558	11	267	278	8.009090909090908	7.829411764705885	8.16454375389732	0	NA	NA	0	NA	NA	NA	0	2

1k320aw	Creepy liminal movie, Big Comfy Couch astetic	Hey everyone, I'm trying to track down a very strange movie I saw on TV late at night sometime in the late 1990s or early 2000s. It felt North American and had a really unique and unsettling atmosphere. The visuals were colorful but also creepy, and the settings often felt like liminal spaces. There was a strong sense of artificiality, almost like a theatrical stage production with children's show colors, and it gave me a similar ""off"" feeling to an adult version of The Big Comfy Couch, but with an underlying unease (though not overtly disturbing like Eraserhead). The scene I remember most clearly is a courtroom with a black and white checkerboard floor. A young woman with an unusual, almost clown-like or theatrical appearance was standing in the middle, being sentenced by a judge on a massive, oversized podium. All the props in the courtroom looked cheaply made and were brightly colored. I also vaguely remember there being some singing that wasn't sad or depressing. Does this incredibly specific combination of details ring any bells for anyone? I've been trying to remember this film for years, and any help would be hugely appreciated! This has been driving me crazy for years, I saw some liminal AI art on Instagram that brought this memory back	Creepy liminal movie, Big Comfy Couch astetic Hey everyone, I'm trying to track down a very strange movie I saw on TV late at night sometime in the late 1990s or early 2000s.

He tries to steal a kiss and she freaks out and shuts him down, calling him a freak.

Then the mom dies and kid has nobody but these two semi-adults. One thing I do remember clearly is one of the college guys is talking to his ex girlfriend and says ""I..."" and his friend chimes in and says ""love you"" and the first guy then repeats it absentmindedly and says ""love you"" but ends up correcting himself and launching into this speech telling his ex-gf he's actually ambivalent about her.

1lbfoir	Seeking out title of a 90s action movie with erotic thriller elements	The first time I saw this movie was on cable in the mid-90s, and I don't quite remember if this movie was an out-and-out erotic thriller or an action movie with erotic elements, but IIRC the basic premise is this: a brunette lady who's a journalist or just an amateur photographer takes photos of a murder/scandal or takes possession of incriminating evidence of something, and comes into contact with an arrogant, feisty cop (with black or salt-and-pepper hair). In fact, the opening credits is a montage of the brunette taking said photos in black and white. Although they banter at first, at some point there is a torrid love scene where they passionately make out in her kitchen or bathroom, knocking over dishes or other props to the ground, and she straddles him while he carries her to the bedroom or pins her against the wall, and the whole thing ends with her riding him after he lowers her bra straps or tries to unhook her bra. THEN, the day after, she tries to leave the cop behind for some reason, only to be attacked in a parking lot by a stranger, and the cop magically comes to the rescue and knocks out the assailant (possibly with martial arts, or slamming his head on a car hood?). I remember nothing else after that. The last time I encountered this movie was either in 2002 or 2006 while some other family members saw it on TV (boy, was that awkward), so I assume that it may still be in circulation, but stupidly, I didn't bother to take down the name. But, seriously, any leads on the title is greatly appreciated, or at least any tips on how to make ChatGPT or A.I. generate the actual title	Seeking out title of a 90s action movie with erotic thriller elements The first time I saw this movie was on cable in the mid-90s, and I don't quite remember if this movie was an out-and-out erotic thriller or an action movie with erotic elements, but IIRC the basic premise is this: a brunette lady who's a journalist or just an amateur photographer takes photos of a murder/scandal or takes possession of incriminating evidence of something, and comes into contact with an arrogant, feisty cop (with black or salt-and-pepper hair).

The movie is from the perspective of a young, black girl who wears braids and glasses - she lives in a motor home and has conversations with her adult neighbor. A memorable scene is her sitting to watch TV inside the trailer home and the Ad mentions the illuminati on the TV. The trailer and the girl are quirky and eccentric.

1kjgcrv	[TOMT][Movie][Animated] Looking for a dark, realistic animated film (1980s2000)	Hi everyone! Ive been trying to remember the name of a full-length animated movie I saw years ago, possibly in the 1990s or early 2000s. Heres what I recall: * It was a **realistic 2D animated film**, not stylized or cartoonish  characters looked like real humans. * It was **dark and serious in tone**, but had small bits of humor. * The **setting included a castle**, but there were also **trains, cars, and early firearms** (like muskets and knives), so it wasnt purely medieval. * There was **no fantasy or magic**. Everything was grounded in reality. * Possibly took place in **Scotland** or had Scottish-like visuals. * There was **a scene where wine was used to poison someone**. * Someone **fakes their death** in the story. * At one point, **a castle window or stones collapse on a person**. * A **train appears** in at least one scene. * Theres a **hunchbacked drunk man** who **falls down stairs into a wine cellar**. * I watched it with a **Finnish dub**, so it was likely released in Finland on VHS or DVD. If this sounds familiar to anyone, Id really appreciate the help. Ive ruled out things like *The Castle of Cagliostro*, *The Black Cauldron*, *The Thief and the Cobbler*, etc. Its not fantasy, and not overly stylized. Thanks in advance!

1k9f4hq	Need help finding a movie with young Brendan Fraser	SOLVED The Twilight of the Golds ------ It's a movie I watched recently, but it came out when Brendan was starting his career in acting I believe - it was a movie where he played a gay character and his family did not accept him. I believe it started with us finding out that his sister was pregnant and they (scientists?) have the ability to see that the child was like 95% likely to develop the 'GAY' trait and the movie was I think basically about whether or not it's okay to abort the baby because the baby \*might\* be born gay and Brendan's character was really upset with the way his parents and sister was reacting to the situation. It's definitely not Gods and Monsters or The Whale but it was an older one that I think Brendan filmed around the same time as Gods and Monsters. I think it had 'Golden' in it's title, like ""the Golden"" something. I was a really good movie and I wanted to watch it again. It's not in his filmography, it's like they wanted to hide this movie or something (maybe he and his costars just didn't like it at the time or it wasn't popular? which is understandable because of the message but I think it was a beautiful movie)	Need help finding a movie with young Brendan Fraser SOLVED The Twilight of the Golds ------ It's a movie I watched recently, but it came out when Brendan was starting his career in acting I believe - it was a movie where he played a gay character and his family did not accept him.

1kkm4p6	Looking for a film with Dr. Dog's ""My Old Ways"" as soundtrack	I watched a film around 15 years ago. It was about a shy man who liked a woman named Laura. Theres a scene at night in a bar where hes writing in a notebook, and there's a voice-over saying something like, ""And why Laura? Is she beautiful? Is she smart?"" In another scene, hes riding a commuter train or metro, and the song ""My Old Ways"" by Dr. Dog is playing. Does anyone know what film this is? It was an indie film, not very well known, and I think it didnt have great ratings. The lead actor was also the director.

1lbhnee	Movie where, at the end, the protagonist pushes a guy out of a protective circle toward a demon	Live-action movie. I watched it a very long time ago, at least 6 years, probably more. The only thing I remember it's near the end, where the protagonist (I think) fights a guy inside a protective circle, protecting them from a demon which has taken the body of a woman (I think it's the protagonist's wife). After the fight, the protagonist pushes the guy outside the circle, in the direction of the demon, then the demon bites the guy's head. Because of the fight between the two, blood was spilled, staining the circle and creating an opening for the demon to enter. The last thing I remember was someone saying that demon was one of the weakest of hell. I'm unsure of this, but I think this whole scene was taken in an underground room, similar to a crypt, or, at least the colors of it resembled a crypt, a yellowish tone with walls of stone.

1kdxmf9	I can't seem to find this movie	I saw a clip of a movie a few months ago on Instagram and now I can't remember which movie it was. The movie itself was black and white. The scene took place in a bedroom and there were two characters on the bed; a lady and a man; they looked like they were together, and in the scene, they started out sitting on the bed. The lady was in the middle of the bed, the man sitting on the edge, and then the lady shifted forward and almost like burrowed herself, idk if I'm explaining it right... like she moved forwards, moved the guy's arm and sort of made him hug her. I don't remember if they said anything. It was this very cute and soft romantic scene (nothing dirty), and I would really like to know what movie it was. P.S I'm assuming it was a movie... but it might be a tv show...

Can you please tell me the title of a thriller / drama movie from the '90 which includes a sex scene from behind involving a male and a female actors? As far as I remember she was wearing something white, I guess a shirt or a tight white swimsuit or something like that (I'm not sure). Again I'm not sure but as far as I remember the scene was taking place in the evening under the rain and she was probably leaning on a fence in the garden of a villa. I thought the movie could have been Wild Things but I've watched it last night and it wasn't that one.

A group of men are car pooling during a rain storm in LA and a bag of cash drops off from an improperly secured cash delivery truck. They decided to split it. Only to find out the next day that the guards on the truck have reported that they were robbed to cover their mistake.. This changes the situation dramatically. I think the driver was shown as a henpecked husband and generally unhappy with life. Any help greatly appreciated.

It was on Tubi or some website about a couple who move into the husbands childhood home. The new wife was asian I think and the husband was white. The old wife appears to the new wife pretending to be a maid but she's actually a ghost. Everyone in the town also gives the new wife a really dirty look always until she finally finds out the truth in a library. The husband had an affair with his old wife's sister once too and he attempts to sell the house at the end leading to him getting shot.

The clothing is like The Brady Bunch. I remember there were siblings, a blonde boy and a blonde girl (also styled like Brady Bunch), the girl has long blonde hair and like short a-line dress in bright orangie colors. I'm not sure but I think their parents had died.. and the detective? Policeman? who tried to solve it, watches over the kids over the years. They had a big shaggy dog, I think? It's set in New England or maybe England. (thinking wooded areas, I can see him walking down a hill in woods). He comes to check on the teenage kids, and finds the girl humming, and acting almost like a child, drawing childlike crude flowers on the wall with her fingers, with what looks like blood. I think there's a bathtub or maybe a sink full of blood.. and he has the realization that the children likely killed their parents. I've been trying to find this movie for YEARS. It's very vivid in my mind. I've enlisted friends to help me, and none of us can figure it out. I don't know if it was part of a compilation, an old made for tv movie. Bear in mind, I would have only had access to ABC, NBC, CBS, PBS, and the brand new FOX from a tv antennae, and likely watched this as a child during an afternoon. Anybody, please help? I'm not crazy, I know I've seen this. I might have details wrong, but the flowers on the wall are so vivid. Thanks.	HELP? This has haunted me for YEARS. Horror film, 1960's? 1970's?

1k3rra9	Anyone recognize this movie?	Hi there! Im trying to find the name of a movie I watched sometime around 20102012. Ive searched everywhere but havent had any luck identifying it. It was a live-action movie, not animated. The plot went something like this: A boy, probably around 11 to 13 years old, visits a nursing home with his school as part of a class project. I clearly remember one scene where an elderly woman from the home was supposed to be paired with one of the girlswho was a friend of the main boybut the old lady didnt want to, so the boy ended up being her partner instead. At first, the woman was kind of grumpy or difficult with him, but eventually they formed a special bond. She had been a singer or performer when she was younger, and she would tell the boy that she was a bird and that he had to make her a feather coat. The movie kind of revolves around the boy looking for feathers to make it and, along the way, learning about her past. At some point, its revealed that she had a son who died by suicidehe jumped off a balcony because he believed he could fly. Near the end of the movie, the old woman sings one last time, and then she turns into ashes. Its impliedsymbolically or maybe even literallythat she was a phoenix, which also explains why her son believed he could fly. I dont remember any character names or actors. I think the boy wore glasses and had light-colored hair. Im not sure where the movie was mademaybe it was a European production? Any leads, hints, or names would be super appreciated. Thanks so much!

1k795q4	Help! Childhood Animated Movie about the Apocalypse and an Insane Knight	Hi everyone! This is my first time posting, but this movie has been bothering me for the last ten years. When I was a kid (c. 2010) I remember watching an animated (old fashioned hand-drawn fantasy) movie where there was a prophecy that a disaster would occur unless the MacGuffin could be recovered, but that there was *three* signs that it would occur. First: That animals would begin dying Second: That men would lose their minds Third: (Can't remember this one well) That the sky would break open There's one specific scene I remember of the main character (a young boy) who was on a foggy, broken bridge, and heard a conversation happening in the distance. He called out for help, but as a knight rode up, he realized that the knight was talking to his own hand (the second sign). Eventually the hand began to argue with the knight, and attempted to strangle him. Please help!	Help! Childhood Animated Movie about the Apocalypse and an Insane Knight Hi everyone!

1knkkdw	Please help me find this film, Medieval Fantasy R-Rated	I wanted to know which film is this- Medieval, Fantasy, R-Rated, idk from 2015 or before. The main lead is a knight and he teams up with some wild different kind of individuals(maybe non humans as well) to probably save the world. I just remember the R-rated stuff so I will shoot it straight. One, one of the man in the team laying with probably dozens of naked women in brothel or something. Two, the female protagonist offers sex to the male protagonist as he saved her life, as some ritual which the female protagonist has or something. Also this scene is maybe in the film that towards the start a lot of knights are somewhere and most of them get killed where the main protagonist (most probably was a newbie then) loses his father or someone close ... So he kinda sets off for his revenge.	Please help me find this film, Medieval Fantasy R-Rated I wanted to know which film is this- Medieval, Fantasy, R-Rated, idk from 2015 or before.

The rich guy that seduces the woman from the main couple was at his car and a had found his next victim. He does malicious look implying that he would do the same purposal. That was a clever ending because it was actually showing that the purposal was a unexceptional thing for the rich guy. The actual ending has a very diferent meaning, as the rich guy really likes the woman, but now i'm wondering from what movie I have that memory. The plot could be completely different from Indecent Purposal. Does anyone knows which movies end like that?

1ljya07	Movie where man travels to hell, grim reaper shows up at mans door	Im trying to remember a movie I saw on premium cable (maybe Cinemax, Starz, or HBO) around 19982000, late at night. It was 100% live-action and either R-rated or not rated maybe. There is a scene where the main character travels to Hell, I believe he was either looking for someone or was told he had to go? The set in Hell was extremely crude (I think on purpose) and there were topless women. I feel like he was actually being given a tour. Another scene involved a different man who was having intercourse with a woman. When they finish he says something about getting another pair of sweat pants. When he gets up someone knocks on his door and he goes to answer it. Its Death/Grim Reaper, and hes there to take him away. The movie felt almost spoofy or campy. It wasnt horror or thriller I dont think. It was probably an indie film. I dont remember any character names. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thank you.

1licmh5	Horror Movie from 90s ?	So I can only remember one scene from this movie. It's a group talking in a relaxed setting which then cuts to a man who's somewhere that's burning. It then shows feet are stuck to the floor by a gooey substance then his head catches fire. The scene ends with a skull on the ground in the burning area. Any thoughts?	Horror Movie from 90s ?

The creature (could've been a spider), visible as a lump under his skin, crawls up his abdomen and out his mouth. Two other people (probably the main protagonists) brust open a door and use fire to kill another (monster/spider) woman that's in the same room. Guy on the couch is dead by then.

1kcd5a3	Someone wakes up from stasis-- NOT Passengers	Having a conversation online and someone mis-remembered the end of the film Passengers, with Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence. He said that she ends up alone, the only one awake on the ship and lives out her days by herself. She adds decor and a garden and things to the ship that the other passengers find when they wake up, but she has already passed away of old age by then. I remember this. I do not remember Passengers. Someone told this person that this is definitely not how the film ends. But it IS the ending to something because I remember it so much better than literally anything in Passengers. Except my anger at Crisp Rat. Help.

1koews8	80 or 90s creepy movie with never ending green fields and a white church?	In the movie all I can remember is a girl being chased by a man who may or may not had a disfigured face. There was a white house or church building in a huge green field that I believe she ran to. The rolling never ending green fields really stuck with me on top of the scary man chasing her. I saw it as a child and always wanted to watch it all the way through. I believe it may be a British/UK movie due to the accents but I could be wrong.	80 or 90s creepy movie with never ending green fields and a white church?

Any help tracking this movie down would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

Me and a friend of mine laughed about it and imagined what kind of world we are heading for, in which VR is getting bigger and bigger and at some point all the weebs in the world will be sitting in a VR masturbator chair and living out their wildest dreams. I remembered a scene from a movie in which a person is sitting in a similar construction and is interrupted in the middle by a phone call. Which movie does this scene appear in? I think the character was some kind of professor and I think he was called by the main character. The scene begins with the viewer first experiencing the perspective in VR and then the VR curtain falls when the call comes and you see the person hanging in the strange construction.

1kj3eg6	Cant remember the movie	I cant think of this movie I watched as a kid. All I can pull apart is at the very beginning of the movie that someone is driving down the road and all of a sudden either and assassin on a motorcycle but more that likely on a helicopter comes on the passenger side of the vehicle and is lowered upside down on a wire and opens fires on this car and person killing them. I now believe that the killing was made to look like a violent car accident. The film is then about a protagonist maybe child or nephew of the person killed trying to find answers. He does find the vehicle in a junkyard to discover bullet holes and finds out it was a targeted attack.	Cant remember the movie I cant think of this movie I watched as a kid.

1k5qykb	Is this Horror movie even real?	I dont even now if this movie is real or I just lumped it together with other movies. This is what I remember I could be a little off on some details so any suggestions will be helpful. This horror movie has two girls as the main characters theres a big age difference. The youngest sister finds a diary in her new attic bedroom and its from the previous occupant of the room. The diary is from a girl who was bullied a lot and died. Turns out that girl possess the diary and ends up possessing the little girl. Theres a flash back scene at one point in the movie that shows how the girl died I think a bunch of kids from the high school attacked her or her boyfriend. Another scene which is towards the end has the older sister and her kinda boyfriend who I think killed the girl fighting the ghost possessing her little sister. The fight scene takes place in the attic bedroom. This was kinda like a b movie and it was made somewhere in between 2000 and 2015. Im thinking it was more between 2000-2010 just because of the jeans and clothes. The actors spoke English.	Is this Horror movie even real?

1knmgb9	Horror scene: Mans head is stuck above ground in a cave while water rises and he drowns	I remember a horror movie I saw (definitely released before 2014 but it might be very old movie and it can be even black and white movie) with a very disturbing scene. A man is trapped in a cave  his entire body is stuck **under the ground**, and **only his head is visible above the surface** through a narrow hole or pit. He's completely stuck in that position, unable to move. Then, **water begins to slowly fill the hole**, rising up around his head. Since he cant move, he starts to drown as the water level keeps rising. While this is happening, the **villain (possibly a demon or a person in costume)** stands across the cave and just watches the man die. I also remember the cave being filled with stalactites and having a very eerie, damp atmosphere. Ive been trying to remember this movie for years. Any help identifying it would be amazing.

He's completely stuck in that position, unable to move. Then, **water begins to slowly fill the hole**, rising up around his head. Since he cant move, he starts to drown as the water level keeps rising. While this is happening, the **villain (possibly a demon or a person in costume)** stands across the cave and just watches the man die. I also remember the cave being filled with stalactites and having a very eerie, damp atmosphere. Ive been trying to remember this movie for years. Any help identifying it would be amazing.

1kc7qcu	Old movie finder	Hi! Help identifying an old movie I watched on VCD as a child Hi everyone! I'm trying to remember the title of a very old movie I watched years ago on a VCD (it had 2 discs). Ive been searching for it for a long time but cant find anything that matches. Heres everything I can remember: The main character is a petite blonde woman with short hair, and she looks very innocent, almost like Mama Mary in terms of beauty. She wears a blue and white maid-like outfit, sometimes with a Victorian maid hat or a napkin/handkerchief on her head. The setting feels like it's in the 1800s or early 1900svery old, vintage, and maybe European. The visual filter is dark, bluish-graysimilar to Van Helsing (2004) or Les Misérables in mood and lighting. She is often seen cleaning the floor, sometimes with blood on it. One memorable scene has her in a place that looks like a butcher room with raw meat hanging. The setting includes a large house, castle, or church. Im not sure if the man in the story is a priest or the owner of the house. The film is not horror, more like thriller or suspense. I dont think the language is English. The film poster (as I recall) mostly featured the woman alone in her maid outfit, with a blue-toned background. Please help if this sounds familiar! Id really appreciate any guesses or ideas.

At the end, he is able to play well and surprises everyone with a drum solo. Not sure how oldnthe movie is, I just remember watching it when I was younger. I just turned 20, to give a frame of how young. (Another detail, when shown he can't play infront of people, he's put on the cowbell for his band class) Everything I look up comes up with Whiplash, which is indeed, NOT what I'm searching for lol	Can't remember a movie All I remember was its a school setting, kid is really good at playing drums but can't preform infront of people and is mocked for it.

I believe it was a thriller/horror, and I was much too young to watch it. The image of the machete intersecting the woman's hand is burned in my memory, but I don't exactly remember what the movie is about. I think she and someone else were on a sailboat in a tropical location, possibly stranded, hence being forced to survive on coconuts. Any ideas?

1kdt4y0	I have been searching for a beautiful Scandinavian film for many years. Can you help?	I saw a film in maybe 1993. It might have been Swedish. In the story, a young man is taking horses to sell. He takes a young woman who was burned on a stove by her father. The father pursues the couple, until they kill him in self-defense . The young man and woman fall in love. She dies in childbirth during a storm when the man goes to help the horses and leaves her. The story is set in the modern day with the young man now old and trying to reach the hut where she died. In a flashback sequence he relives that night and the kettle sings again (as it does at mystical moments)  this time he chooses to stay with her. He is found dead by his children. The film is narrated in part by the young woman. I remember it as a hatful of dreams but I have never been able to find out anything about this film. Not even Perplexity! Can anyone help?

1kc17uw	I'm looking for a romantic drama movie from 2010+? I have some hints but can't remember the name. Please help	Hello. I've been having trouble sleeping for a year now because of the title of a movie, but I only have a few hints because if I knew more, I would figure it out. The story is about two people who meet at a party. I know she's a florist because she helps him design the garden in the house he bought with his girlfriend. I know the preview of the movie is in the park on the bench. I know that love has flared up between them, but the last shot of the movie is right there on that bench, where I think he gives her some kind of gift and she lets it there as she leaves - she announces that she is going somewhere to study art or something. And I also know there's one scene where he's arguing with his girlfriend about the couch because they didn't pick it together. I would be incredibly grateful if someone could help me get this worm out of my head once and for all. Thank you to everyone who read this and I hope you have a wonderful time.	I'm looking for a romantic drama movie from 2010+? I have some hints but can't remember the name. Please help Hello. I've been having trouble sleeping for a year now because of the title of a movie, but I only have a few hints because if I knew more, I would figure it out. The story is about two people who meet at a party. I know she's a florist because she helps him design the garden in the house he bought with his girlfriend. I know the preview of the movie is in the park on the bench.

1k776mv	What movie was this ? or was it even real Giant Sturgeon in lake (Comedy)	My son and I swear that we saw a movie about a couple who move to Minnesota (or perhaps Wisconsin or Michigan, a great lakes state) on arrival all the neighbors are very friendly and keep bringing cooked sturgeon as a welcome gift ""Here I made you a sturgeon"" At one point the man jumps in a lake and comes face to face with a giant, scary looking sturgeon. The film was a comedy as I recall, I remember seeing most of it, as does my son. We think the film is at least 13 years old, based on where we lived at the time. Is this a mandella effect ? We have searched every film base, google, IMDB and cannot find any trace of the film. We also cannot remember who was in it. My youngest son, a film buff, says he has never heard of it as does the wife. But my son and I think it is a film we both watched .

He meets an old couple at their house and asks if they have seen a lady in a green dress.

The man returned to where the house was to find it had burnt down and vanished. We are unsure if we saw it on talking pictures tv or film 4 in the UK a few years ago but are unsure if this was a British or American production and was made circa 1940-1950s. current searches online suggested this could have been a b movie/ made for tv/ full length anthology episode if anyone can help we would be really appreciative.

So things don't go well and they start killing them one by one with the killer leaving some kind of messages about crimes that the guests had committed before.I think the crime of one of the women there was that she accidentally killed her daughter-in-law by electrocuting her.Everyone wonders who the killer is but in the end I think it was the woman who actually invited them to the island.I don't remember what her whole idea was but it had to do with the fact that her husband (maybe her father? I know it was someone close to her but I don't know exactly who) was an incredible artist but he dressed differently and when he had a heart attack on the street everyone thought he was homeless and didn't do anything.If an ambulance had been called sooner he would have survived or at least that's what she thinks.Her entire monologue was basically about how people are selfish monsters and that's why she decided to start killing people who haven't met justice for their actions.How she found out about the crimes of the people on the island, no idea but that's all I remember from it.That and a machete that I'm sure they used to kill a few people. Thank you if you read all that and for any possible information. English isn't my first language so I'm sorry if there's mistakes:)(the series/movie was in English but i still suck at writing)	Can't remember the name of the movie/series I want to watch a series/movie I watched years ago, I think it was around or after 2020/23 but I can't remember the name of it.I remember this from the plot - a group of strangers are invited to a mysterious vacation on a tropical island.The place they stayed wasn't big like a hotel or anything.

1l6gxzz	[MOVIE][2000s] Rom-Com where a woman and a man (a pastor?) switch briefcases, leading to her finding an adult toy during a work presentation.	Hi everyone, I'm trying to find a romantic comedy I watched sometime between 2000 and 2011. The specific scene I remember is a man and a woman bumping into each other on the street, causing them to drop and accidentally switch their identical briefcases. The woman goes to her job, which I believe was in some sort of creative field, possibly a car design agency. During a professional presentation, she opens the briefcase to show her work, but instead finds an adult toy. The twist is that the briefcase belongs to the man she bumped into, who I think was a pastor or a counselor. He had the adult toy to recommend to a couple he was advising to help with their marital issues. Does this sound familiar to anyone? I've been trying to figure this out for a while. Thanks for the help!	[MOVIE][2000s] Rom-Com where a woman and a man (a pastor?) switch briefcases, leading to her finding an adult toy during a work presentation.

And two guys fighting against a third who was from their military unit, but in dreams and they need real guns and ammo. One scene, one of the two guys is asleep on a couch, shooting holes in the ceiling as he fights in dreamland. He runs out, where his bud hands him another couple mags and he's back at it. The only other scene I -think- I recall is at the end the unit is all together again in the jungle, as if going back in time, or maybe the whole thing was a dream. The two remember what they went through, and that their 'brother' is a madman and they just smoke him. Any of this sound familiar to anyone, pretty please?

Then, the lady is diagnosed with a terminal illness and she apparently wants the guy to shoot her while they are making love? And he does. Does anyone know what movie this may be? It could be that she's remembering several different movie plots at once, she's been known to do that. This plot is so wild, I'm actually curious to know if this is even a real movie. TIA!

This black guy goes to the store to buy ingredients for catfish enchiladas and when he returns to the house the old lady who lives there suddenly passes. I think the old ladys name was Cookie and she had a necklace with a C on it which was later revealed it was C for casino, not Cookie. What is this movie??

1kbg5pm	Does anyone know this series:	Does anyone know this series? The series is about a boy. He moves into a new house near water. The boy finds a door (or a mirror) what leads to a different time(hundred years or so back). Time when a town that is now under the water is still up. One person they befriend from that time is mute, blind. The film also showed how they had to protect their home from demolition. One scene is where one of the friends pretends to have rabies to scare away the people who want to tear down the house. The series should be in German, Swedish, Norwegian or some similar language to those. And it it pretty old movie. There were phones, but old phones	Does anyone know this series: Does anyone know this series? The series is about a boy. He moves into a new house near water.

1ljnh27	Searching for a movie for many years	Hello! A while ago (early 2000s), I had rented a movie where the main character is a male teen/college age student who is doing a video project for his school with a camcorder. He stumbles across a serial killer doing something in an alley and the killer threatens him unless he agrees to follow him around recording what he does. Eventually the killer kidnaps a waitress and takes out her eyes and puts them in a jar or something. I think the killer has a series of tunnels. I just remember what this movie was called.

A scarf tied over her head with oversized sunglasses and nude red lipstick. Her body draped in a loose orange floral mini dress. She advertises as any other famous fake psychic. Huge billboards and TV specials. That's until while filming for a show. She noticed a small boy that has a candle holder bludgeoned into the side of his temple. Seeing this she gasps in horror. Having not seen a ghost for quite some time now. Takes place in the 80s the child is from the original colonies pre revolution.

1l57cst	RomCom not well known	About 10 years ago when Netflix was just getting off as a streaming platform, i by chance watched a romcom movie on it. A few weeks later we canceled Netflix and Ive always wondered what the movie was. My memory is fuzzy so Ill do my absolute best to describe it. Main character is a woman. Early in the movie, I feel like her and some friends and brother arrive at either (a) a family vacation home (b) vacation cabins/resort. I have always believed that they were there for a wedding. I also want to believe that something involving her ex-boyfriend was happening (my strongest idea is thats were there for his wedding). Here is the absolute strongest memory I have. They are at some kind of party (like maybe either a day before the wedding celebration or the reception?) here she is talking to her gay brother and confides that all she wants is what he and his husband has. He reveals to her that their relationship has fallen on hard times and (I think) they are getting a divorce. She says something like if you two cant make it.. who can? Its nothing like Family Stone or Wedding Date. If it was made in the last six years.. its definitely not it.

1lejgqr	Random small budget film	Based in the U.K. - somewhere coastal. Initial scenes are about a male gangster who drives a jaguar (potentially called Ray) - sent to kill someone I believe. He meets a young woman - sparks a friendship - she works in a local cafe where she skates around. They are friends only. Later in the movie, he jumps into the local marina and swims a little bit wearing his suit. He then later goes to his brothers house - accidentally shoots the family cat. Thats all I can remember!!! I saw it around 2016-2017. Can anyone rack their brains as to what this movie was called? The gangster had long slick hair and I swear he was called Ray	Random small budget film Based in the U.K. - somewhere coastal.

My elementary school librarian showed a short movie with a character named Tippu (Tip pooh) puppy who has this weird hoop toy that he spazzes out over. I literally remember nothing else other than being creeped out by it and wondering why she kept showing it to us every week. This was circa de 1994. I went to school in a super small town, so there is no telling how old it was. It was in color. I am guessing 1980s.

Its all so violent, and all of this biting then cuts to a scene of her drowning in a flood of blood. Its driving me nuts that I cant find it anywhere, all I can remember is it went viral the way it was just a scene without any context, probably to scare off people (it was low res when I watched it).

1kgabg3	I need help finding a movie I watched when I was a kid	I need to start by saying that I don't have much information, since I watched it a long time ago and I was about 5 years old. But if you have any suggestions, I would be very grateful. Part of the story or plot: I don't remember much, but it's about a little girl who travels with her father. He's a movie director and goes on this trip because he's going to film something in that place, and ends up taking his daughter. There's also a little boy she meets there. Characters or actors: There's the little girl, the father, a little boy she meets there (who I think is also a ghost) and ghost nuns. I think the little girl is blonde. Memorable scene: There are two scenes that I remember. One is when she was watching the production/filming of a scene and sees a man on the balcony and he smiles at her, and then he falls/jumps off the balcony. She gets scared but when she looks there's no one there and she later discovers that it was a ghost. The other scene, she and the boy see a group of nuns dancing in the forest at night and also realizes that they are ghosts. (It's been a long time since I watched it, so these 2 scenes could be from different movies, idk). Where/how I watched it: I watched it on TV (Brazil), maybe on a channel that showed religious movies, and low-budget movies. I don't remember any well-known actors in the production of the movie. I believe it is a foreign film (maybe European). Time: I watched it between 2003 and 2005, but it could have been made in the 80s/90s or even before that. Genre: Light horror and drama. With a lighter and more spiritual approach than horror I have the impression that the scenes were filmed in old places like monasteries or convents, mainly because of the scene with the nuns. I put this information on ChatGPT and it gave me some movie options, but it's none of them: \- The Convent (1995) \- The Other (1972) \- The Watcher in the Woods (1980) \- The Innocents (1961)	I need help finding a movie I watched when I was a kid I need to start by saying that I don't have much information, since I watched it a long time ago and I was about 5 years old.

The beginning(i think the beginning?) Is where this teenaged boy gets dropped off at a unmaintained looking mansion, (i think by his aunt) and so he goes inside....it was a little blank for me here so I'll continue with the middle of the movie. He meets this demon that looks like a giant head made of fire attached to the fireplace, and the demon is trying to get him excited enough about a glamorous future he could have as a famous songwriter and musician, i think he gets a icky feeling and leaves the room i dont remember, but he finds the ghost of his mom, who warns him to not sign the demon's contracts, at all. He goes back to the fireplace room, the demon shows him a super fancy amazing guitar, the teen plays it a bit, demon grinning horrifically then suddenly, he finishes a note and throws the instrument into the fireplace, destroying it. The demon is really mad, and begins burning the place down in a fit of rage. The teen escapes, but the place is burned to the ground.

1l9hkdk	Ninja\Samurai\Japanese Movie	I remember one scene in particular: Ninja type guy wearing a large, stereotypical Japanese hat (jingasa?). Crouched, kneeling on the floor. Black hat, with a large black cloak and mask covering his mouth. Very dark room, relatively small, traditional Japanese style, all wooden beams and panelling. I think there was two Important Protagonists in the room, discussing if the currently available ninjas were good enough for some particular job, or if one of the guys new, female ninjas were really better. He has to prove he's good by getting out of the room but there's a couple of female ninjas\assassins there to stop him doing so. He whirls around, big dramatic cloak ruffling sound and crouches. There's metal claws on wire thrown to climb quickly, lots of quiet noise in the darkness meaning there's things happening, severed fingers rolling across the floor, all done very quietly. He doesn't make it out. Absolutely can't be certain of a year, but I would have seen it circa 1995 or before.

I think I rented it from Family Video in the early 2010s but it was likely filmed between 2000-2010. It was an indie film that was a drama about the end of the world or like some big event coming that is suppose to be disastrous. All I can really remember is at the end the disastrous events ends up that people start floating off the earth. I think some have ropes on keeping them from floating into space.

1lfsh3p	Low Budget 00s Slasher	I dont have a lot of information, but I hope it rings a bell for someone. It likely came out in the early 00s, but could be earlier. I rented it around 2007 or 2008. The killer is a man with long greasy hair and a goatee. Maybe it took place in the 70s!? Big maybe though. His motivation for killing is to get revenge for something that happened at a big outdoor party years ago. I think the crowd was rich and snobby and rejected him, or maybe he caught his girlfriend cheating with a rich guy? Thats pretty much all I remember plot wise. The scene I remember most is a car crash/flip because it was so funny! The film and the quality of the moment the car crashes is completely different than the rest of the movie. Its as if they didnt have a stunt budget so they found old stock footage of a car flipping and edited it in. It was so obvious and cheesy, and pretty much the only reason I vaguely remember the movie at all. Thank you!!

I dont remember the actors' names, but the tone was **dark and tragic**, like a twisted romance/crime drama. Any help in finding the name of the movie would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance.

1lfff3s	Help me identify this blaxploitation movie!	I do pest control and today while I was spraying a house there was a movie on the tv. I couldnt exactly watch the screen the whole time so I can only describe small bits. Looked like a blaxploitation comedy or at least a movie heavily inspired by the blaxploitation era. It seemed to be the beginning of the movie and opened up with narration from a radio announcer discussing various topics eventually stating something along the lines of *insert unknown political figure* is tolerant of homosexuality as long as they dont do it around him. This is stated as what appears to be a very feminine black man enters a ladies room on the side of a building. The person who I assume is one of if not THE main character appears and he is a black man with a big poofy afro. He along with several other characters all meet up in some sort of locker room where they are changing into (or maybe changing out of) orange jumpsuits. Thats about all the info I have. It looked like it could be a 70s movie or a 90s movie made to look like the 70s. But it seemed really funny and Im interested in watching whatever it is.

1l5xhy9	Movie where a man fondles another fat mans chest, almost as if he is using an arcade machine	Sounds very weird, I know.

1kgck9s	Name of this movie	All morning I've been thinking about this movie. I think it was a romance movie with 3 main characters. 2 Males that I believe were colleagues. The one is a jerk who starts dating this woman. The other is a kind man who befriends his girlfriend and doesn't go to clubs. If I remember correctly he joins her book club and is the only male. The boyfriend cheats on the woman I think? and I think the 2nd male is conflicted about telling her or not. I want to say is mid 2000's? I could wrong on that. All 3 people have brown hair I think.

1kcjx3w	Please help me find this movie	Hi everyone, I need help remembering the name of a thriller movie I watched a while back. Here's what I remember: Plot Summary: The movie revolves around a female lead who is incredibly manipulative and very smart. She plays mind games with the male lead throughout the film, causing a lot of tension. At one point, there's a scene where a door is rigged with a bomb to target a specific person. The male lead is caught in a dangerous situation, with the female lead pulling the strings behind the scenes. Ending: The male lead ends up in jail. But, just before the movie ends, the suspicious male lead receives a book/document containing the female lead's school group photo from when she was younger. This happens with the help of the jail administration. After viewing the photo, he realizes that her identity was completely different from what he had known throughout the movie. The big reveal at the end is her true identity. Relationship: I think the male and female leads are husband and wife, though I could be mistaken about this detail. Genre: It's a thriller, and theres a lot of suspense and mystery surrounding the characters and their motivations. The film ends on a shocking note that ties everything together. Has anyone seen this movie? What is its name?	Please help me find this movie Hi everyone, I need help remembering the name of a thriller movie I watched a while back.

1kgqj9n	Laboratory Incineration Scene?	I am looking for a scene to a movie/TV show, which I have completely forgotten in which there is a man in a hazmat suit working with some kind of chemical or biological substance in a modern-looking laboratory. Eventually, he looks at his glove and sees a black substance on it and realizes it is eating through his glove and causing it to melt. This is when an alarm goes off, alerting him that a contamination has been detected and to decontaminate immediately. He rushes out of the room and starts taking everything off when the lab door seals behind him. It is here that the loudspeaker announces that the lab will be purged/burned or something. The scientist screams ""NO!"" and runs to the door, trying to open it, but it is too late. The lab is flash burned, burning all of his work before his eyes. I think it is a newer movie/show as the effects looked very good. What am I thinking of?	Laboratory Incineration Scene?

The film ends with the main woman in the countryside who is helped by a cop, where he notices the tattoo when she bends over: It now has a flower on top of the original tattoo - a flower growing from the dirt since the original tattoo looks like a patch of dirt.

The plot takes place on a road like the famous Route 66, where a husband, wife, and daughter are driving in a car. It's dark. A car with 4 bad guys in it appears behind them and they start harassing them while driving and then they stop them and the problem begins. The main bad guy has long blonde hair and they kidnap the mother and daughter and leave the father in the dark on the road without a car. They decide to come back for him but they can't find him (he hid in the desert). There's also an old sheriff in the movie, who has lung cancer. He decides to help his father catch the bad guys and later take revenge because they raped and killed both his daughter and mother. The father was hesitant about taking revenge, but the sheriff initiated it because he has lung cancer and will die very soon and doesn't want injustice. At the end of the movie, the last scene is in a cabin, the father finds the main villain and comes to kill him but hesitates. Then the villain says something very derogatory about his wife and daughter which provokes him and he pulls the trigger and kills the main villain. He comes out of the cabin and falls to the desert floor. That's all I remember.	Help me find a movie Come on, find me a movie based on the following details and scenes.

She runs to a small town? Pub? Bar? No one wants to help, it's like they are all on the killers side, they ignore her cries for help. The girl hides in the toilet (old school toilet with a tank on the top and a chain) the murder is close by and she escapes through a small window in toilet. I remember watching Eden Lake afterwards and thinking it was a rip off of that film. Reminds me of how I watched Rec first and quarantine afterwards.

We saw it on TV, around 2012 - 2016 (the movie may be older) It was a children's story, but when I saw it I was scared The plot that I remember: It was about a young boy, he lived with his parents in a cottage in the woods and there were beehives everywhere outside their house. The boy was probably adopted, he looked a bit like a bear, or he later turned into a bear, and his parents disappeared (I think the ones he lived with didn't like him very much) He was very sad and probably went looking for them. He came across a man and he trapped him in a trailer, later they went somewhere together and a big whale asked them about their most secret wish. the boy was probably afraid of bees the cottage was very simple, only wooden furniture the man was probably from the circus it's a similar vibe to: kuky se vraci 2010 or bear story (gabriel osorio) 2014 bear story has a similar story to the movie i'm looking for, only this was a children's fairy tale i think it was definitely over 30 minutes long I've been searched for this movie for a long time and I can't find it. I would be very grateful for every comment. I searched on Google, asked people on Facebook groups, drew what I remember, messed around with chat gbt, a million word combinations, and failed	film from my childhood Hi, please help me find a movie from my childhood.

1kjcgcp	Friends and I have a collective memory about a movie but cant remember the title	We believe this is an animated movie featuring woodland creatures, probably released between 2005-2012 We have a vague collective memory of a scene where several characters are gathered and an announcement is made that someone baked cookies or brownies. The response from all or at least one of the characters is an emphatic TIIIIIIIIGHT!!! We think the Tight sayer/s includes a bear. We think the cookie/brownie baker may have been a Grandma? Maybe a character named Beaver? Anyway this is where things get very hazy and unreliable. Ive started going through movie candidates and we can rule out Open Season (2006) and Over the Hedge (2006)& but their sequels are still possibilities I guess. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Deliver us from this nightmare.

I remember one scene where the lead male and female are together on a bed, she is naked besides a big ribbon tied around her chest, as a gift for him, he pulls open the ribbon and chases her playfully under the sheets (then maybe some guys come in with guns)? I think they may also have been a scene where the main lead is trying to find/chase someone and they disappear/turn into a bunch of leaves or newspapers on the street.

1liz82i	Movie that used ghostbusters scene	I saw a movie (possibly some series) couple weeks ago that used a scene from ghostbusters 84. Its the scene where they first go to the firehouse looking to buy it. The outside shot where the realtor voice is telling them about it to be exact (like a 4-5 second shot) i assume bc of copyright or whatever, the shot was mirrored so everything was backwards but as a fan of gb i instantly recognized the scene. And now i cant remember what movie or possibly show it was from! Ive googled this and nothing comes up. I only use hulu, tubi, max, and pluto at home and ive search all these services for this movie amd cant find anything i think itd be in. Obviously it would have to be made after 84 and i think itd have to be a time period piece. Anyone?

1keaj4h	Action movie from 80/90s?	Only remember bits of one scene because I watched it 20ish or more years ago. Fight scene in what was maybe an abandoned building. Western action movie probably as it was a fist fight between two men. I think at least one of them had longer dark hair. The room they fought in was somewhat dark with maybe a shot of a wall fan in it. The building had a stairway on the outside that was used by a character in a back alley. This wasnt the final scene in the movie. Going to take a wild guess that the building was maybe reddish in color. I think maybe the protagonist was a cop type character. I watched this with my late father growing up and would really like to rewatch it. Thanks!	Action movie from 80/90s? Only remember bits of one scene because I watched it 20ish or more years ago.

1l1b4me	Can anyone help me figure out the movie?	Hey, I've been trying to figure out a movie that I watched when I was younger (late 90's/early 00's). I've been looking for years with no success and I'm starting to believe I made this movie up. I remember watching this live-action fantasy movie on VHS, probably from the 1980s or 1990s. The plot involved a boy who is grieving the death of his mother. He constantly watches videos of her on a small portable TV  I recall a scene where his teacher gets annoyed with him watching it in class and possibly confiscates it. The boy ends up befriending three small magical beings (possibly dwarfish or goblin-like) who are trying to stop a rich villain from opening a box that contains something evil. When the box is opened, black tendrils emerge and infect people with evil. I think the teacher may have been working with the villain but changes sides later in the movie. Theres a twist where the villain is actually revealed to be one of the magical beings in disguise. The film ends with the boy coming to terms with his mothers death  possibly with the teacher beginning a relationship with his father  and the boy throws the portable TV away in a garbage truck, symbolizing him moving on. I recall it being in english, but I can recall for sure if it was dubbed or not. Any help would be very much appreciated. Thanks!	Can anyone help me figure out the movie?

1k6kfuj	Need help finding a movie I remember nothing about...	...I know, I don't exactly have much to go off of here. The ONLY thing I remember is some hooded monk/priest character who wasn't even a main character and all you could see was his nose and for whatever reason he scared me as a kid. There may have been several of them, maybe a cult/convent? It might have been one of those straight-to-TV movies, saw it in the early to mid-90s and therefore remember nothing about it. Creepy hooded monks/priest with big nose...that's all I got for you guys lol. I don't remember any actors, the plot or even the genre though I'm fairly certain it wasn't horror. Suspense maybe? You can probably understand why trying to Google this has proved unsuccessful.	Need help finding a movie I remember nothing about... ...I know, I don't exactly have much to go off of here.

1ledyhm	amish thing with woody harrelson?	i watched it anywhere from 2018-2021, it was this amish or country type of family where woody harrelson played the father, there was an older sister too which im pretty sure was the mc, and a bunch of siblings. they were redheads, and one scene i distinctly remember is when they go visit the grandparents and the father (harrelson) walked in on the grandma raping the little brother (harrelsons son). the father yells at her and she tries to excuse it by saying she was only fixing his underwear. its implied that she touched on the father like that too when he was younger. the vibe of the movie was pretty depressing, real country christian white trash type shit. couldnt recognize anything like it in the list of woody harrelson movies	amish thing with woody harrelson? i watched it anywhere from 2018-2021, it was this amish or country type of family where woody harrelson played the father, there was an older sister too which im pretty sure was the mc, and a bunch of siblings. they were redheads, and one scene i distinctly remember is when they go visit the grandparents and the father (harrelson) walked in on the grandma raping the little brother (harrelsons son). the father yells at her and she tries to excuse it by saying she was only fixing his underwear. its implied that she touched on the father like that too when he was younger. the vibe of the movie was pretty depressing, real country christian white trash type shit. couldnt recognize anything like it in the list of woody harrelson movies	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	1	33	739	773	5	130	135	7.600000000000001	52.60666666666667	28.006751824817517	4	NA	NA	1	NA	NA	NA	3	6

1lf725h	Baseball anime	So my cousin's high school team had a pitcher throwing a no-hitter into the 7th inning and they gave up an error, and through high School shenanigans the runner scored without a hit and they lost the game. I remember years ago where I saw an anime where this same thing happened. Except instead of it being a no-hitter it was a double perfect game. The one pitcher struck out on a wild pitch and got on first, then stole second and third and then scored on another wild pitch so it was a double perfect game but one team still won. Can someone help me find the anime this came from?

Theres a pool for water therapy, one of the girls was admitted to this facility and needed water therapy.. 2-3 of her friends try to get in to stop it. The girl slips/falls into the pool with the pool cover still on and I believe she drowns? Her friends warned her about this beforehand (like its dangerous to be alone) and she didnt listen. Theres also a scene where the girls are outside of the facility. There could be a big glass window on the facility?	Horror movie, maybe early 2000s?

So I was sleeping on the couch when I was about 9 and woke up to my dad watching a horror movie (I think it was a movie, could have been a t.v. series), but I only saw about 15 minutes of the film, and it gave me nightmares for years. The scene I woke up to was a bunch of adults trapped in a large white dome with hexagonal shaped doors that all led back into the same room (yes, like that iconic Scooby-Doo scene).

1knj8nk	Cant remember this film	Im looking for a movie I saw on Netflix. A young guy, maybe around 20, becomes a millionaire by smuggling money for rich people (possibly set in Monaco). He gets the job by driving a drunk guy home and calling him unreliable. He ends up having an affair with the wife of the rich guy he works for. He buys a Porsche, lives the high life, but eventually the woman he had the affair with betrays him and he goes to jail. Someone calls one of the rich guys an insatiable plonker. It was an action/thriller on Netflix around a year ago. Purple themed. Any ideas haha	Cant remember this film Im looking for a movie I saw on Netflix.

1kizzv8	Was this a movie or was I shown porn as a kid???	Hi! Throwaway account because... yeah. Ive been trying to figure out what movie this scene was from. I watched it as a kid probably around 2006? I told my friend about it today and he was like are you sure it wasnt just porn? And I couldnt say for certain& Anyway, now its driving me crazy!

Im trying to identify a movie scene I saw decades ago, I was maybe 5-7 so the gory scene burnt into my memory. Now trying to find the source of that scene cus morbid curiosity. * The setting seemed **dystopian**, maybe part of an arena or death game. * A **man is strapped to a table** (maybe asian?), and a **spinning saw blade** or similar device is slowly descending toward him. **The room was bright white** with the man on the table and audience contrasting it with deep black. * There's a **crowd of onlookers**, who are **cheering and waving money**, seemingly betting on how long hell last. * The man **pleads for his life** as the blade gets closer. * Eventually, the blade **cuts him in half**, and the **table splits apart**, pulling the two halves of his body away from each other. * The tone was serious, graphic, and violent, not a comedy or parody as far as I remember. Then again I only saw 5 second of it. * Maybe it's not from a mainstream movie, but the special effects looked too good for a straight to dvd/tv movie. * Like most teens, I went through a lot of horror films, Texas Chainsaw, Saw, Final Destination, Friday the 13th, etc etc so its likely not from that group. (But not 100%) It felt like a dystopian action or horror film, but I cant recall any actors or titles. Any ideas?

1kgos11	Movie Ive been struggling to find for years	Removed: Ban Evasion I've been trying to find this movie I saw only once for the past seven years. It's definitely an obscure movie and I've surprisingly seen one other person on TOMT looking for it as well. It came out around 2006-2010 and I remember watching it on Directv. It most likely didn't get any sort of theatrical release and I'm unsure if it was ever released on dvd or if it was on television only. The premise of the movie was extremely strange and the protagonist was a pedophile but the movie seemed to romanticize it and kind of brushed past it. He lives with his mother and he's a complete loner, she tries to set him up on a date with a friend of hers and they all drink wine together in the mother's living room. As they're drinking he suddenly goes quiet and pukes all over the floor. In another scene he meets a really young girl who's wearing a pink wig and skateboarding in front of her house. He sits down and talks to her for a while and they both get along and as the movie progresses they start dating. He tells his mother about his new girlfriend and pulls a photo of the girl out from his shirt pocket. His mom laughs at the phot and asks him if it's a photo of her when she was young, he tells her it's not and says it was a current picture of her. The mom gets visibly upset and faints. I remember the movie ending with him going to visit the girl at her house and he's told that she's in the hospital. He goes to see her and she's laying in the bed without her wig on and they talk for a while before she dies. After that he starts running through the rain and almost gets hit by a car. Afterwards I think he shoots himself and that's where it ends. Seven years ago I randomly remembered seeing this movie and thought ""holy shit that was a really weird movie, what was that?"" And I haven't been able to find anything since. I always wonder if the company that produced this wiped any existence of it because of the insane premise of the movie lol. I really hope someone can help me solve this, thanks!	Movie Ive been struggling to find for years Removed: Ban Evasion I've been trying to find this movie I saw only once for the past seven years.

1klgn2i	Please help me find this mystery movie	Hey! This is going to be such a vague list of things I remember about this movie but it has been bothering me for years and I dont even know why! I have tried to use AI to help me find it to no avail! I think the film could have been made for TV broadcast but Im not sure. Possibly released between 1989-2011? Id bet on it being from pre 2009 though. I saw a film probably around 14 years ago on UK Television. The general gist of the movie was a tumultuous mother/daughter relationship where the mother was convinced that the teenage daughter was going to get pregnant. There was a scene where the mother walked in on the daughter sitting on a boys lap and absolutely freaked out. I think the characters were supposed to be American but that may not be correct. I know that this is basically nothing to go off but I would really appreciate any help at all! TIA	Please help me find this mystery movie Hey!

1kh0yoy	Short body horror about couple becoming conjoined. Watched on mainstream streaming service	With the movie Together coming out this year I was reminded of a horror short I watched years ago as a random click on Netflix or Prime. I believe the couple goes to sleep in the same bed and then wakes up with part of their bodies fused together. There is a Spanish shirt called Dos that is the same concept but not the one I'm thinking of - Dos is much more dramatic whereas this one is more subdued.

1ko7ubu	Asian revenge movie	Ive been searching for this for years, but all I have is the following. A guy gets out of prisons after serving time for a yakuza (I think) related crime. Hes sitting in a dark bar drinking whiskey and getting quite drunk when his old gang (I think) shows up. It becomes clear that he has no intention on going back to his old criminal ways (I dont remember exactly why). So one of the gang members puts his cigarette out in the guys drink whereupon the guy without hesitation finishes his drink, cigarette and all, to show hes not afraid and doesnt care. Thats the start of this revenge tale. I dont remember the reason for his revenge quest. Maybe he unwillingly took the fall for someone by doing time, but Im not sure. Nonetheless hes working his way closer to the guy/guys responsible. Its a very colourful movie, lots of small clubs with colourful light. I think I remember him dancing allot and I think hes drunk the whole film. Dancing, drinking and killing. I think the movie is from the 90s, could be earlier. Not sure of any actor or director. Not 100% sure its Japanese. So, what I remember is basically a guy finishing his drink with a cigarette in it and then dancing and drinking his way through colourful clubs, probably killing on his way but definitely seeking revenge on the guy in charge. Please help!	Asian revenge movie Ive been searching for this for years, but all I have is the following. A guy gets out of prisons after serving time for a yakuza (I think) related crime.

1lju9vl	Foreign abduction movie where abductor tries to make the victim marry him?	I want to say the movie was in Spanish? I watched it on Netflix a number of years ago. What I remember is this woman gets abducted on a run through her neighborhood by a guy who has been watching her(?) on her route everyday. He keeps her locked inside, tries to make her fall in love with him, tries to get her to agree to marry him, and I want to say she ends up escaping at the end. I believe the house had a big wall surrounding it with a gate (kind of like a villa). I've been trying to remember the name of this movie for years, but as I don't speak the language and it's been several years, I don't even know where to begin in trying to find it again and my searches have been no luck.

1l5w5n7	Movie Asian?	What movie/serie is this? Hello, I once watched a movie or serie, I think it was Korean. Almost sure. There was heavy drinking in it. Not drinking to necessarily enjoy oneself, but to make a point. It was about loyalty, betrayal, changing sides etcetera, and when the higher-up wanted to make a point and the subordinate prove his loyalty; the higher-up/boss would pour whiskey till the glass was almost full. In short; movie about power, politics also I guess, in which making someone drinking excessively was essential to make a point/demand proving their loyalty.	Movie Asian? What movie/serie is this?

1la5arq	Looking for a 1940s/50s ish	I have this memory when I was a kid at my grandparents house late at night of an old black and white movie on tv of two kids in Rome getting separated at a young age, they are sleeping in bed and wake up to a man coming into their room. He has a whip and hits them across the arms with it leaving a matching mark on them both. One of them faints, he kidnaps the other one. They later find each other as adults by the mark, and are thrown into the coliseum running from lions in chariots. I fell asleep before I could finish it. Does anyone know what movie this is?

It was mainly about a women and his captor a man who kept her in a room. But there was some huge psychological twist about her or her origins (she was a clone? A robot? This is the key here) Usually kidnapping type movies are dark and gritty but this one I remember had a 70s vibe to it with a very light room with white walls. Her room was more like a 70s 1 or 2 bed apartment. Its possibly foreign as I watched the IFC channel a ton back In the day.	Distinct Psychological thriller - 70s 80s I can see it in my head!!

1l8apqg	Movie I saw late 90s/early 00s, girl shoots herself in the stomach	I was a child and only saw a little bit of the movie, so my memory of it might not be the best. It was on TV, so it was maybe a bit older, but I have a feeling it was made in the 90s. Could be wrong tho. I have a memory of a scene where a girl or a young woman dressed in a white dress is standing in a garden next to some apple trees or something. She has some kind of a tiny gun that she shoots herself with in her lower stomach. You can see a red spot appear on the dress, but she didn't die or anything. Next scene I remember, she is in a house, sitting in an old bathtub and her mother is angrily washing her and takes out the bullet. My memories might be horribly warped, but that's what I remember lol. I've been trying to figure out what this movie was for years so hoping someone recognizes it.

He main character was a white guy (maybe a soldier?), who somehow ended up in an alien desert (maybe crashed ship? Walked through portal?). The alien race is enslaved I THINK by their own people. Theyre tall, taller than a human but smaller than a Navi. I believe their skin is pale greens. They had sort of smooth face (I think???). Theres a scene in the movie where the protagonist is found by the alien race and taken against his will. They chain him up and start feeding their offspring a weird liquid that gifts them language? The guy tries to resist it but he is force fed it, then hes able to understand the aliens around him. Another scene theres a female of the species having her back whipped, her father is afraid for her because theres no more unmarred skin on her back. one more disobedience and theyd execute her. Im sorry for this mind fuck of a description- I watched it when I was little and can barely remember it.

A criminal on the run from mob hitmen gets arrested after a brawl where the female cop gets knocked down.

1ld0b6l	Early 2000s romcom?	Hi everyone! Im trying to remember the name of a movie I saw a few years ago. Its about a guy and a girl who work at a grocery store together. Its one of those cliche movies where the guy and girl are best friends and the guy is in love with her but she doesnt know it. Everything Ive googled keeps giving me Employee of the Month as my answer but Im positive it wasnt that movie. The main girl was brunette and the main guy was somebody that I remember looking similar to James Norton or Zach Gilford. One specific part of the movie I remember is that the girl was attracted to and trying to impress her neighbor. Another detail I remember is the guy and girl sitting in the grocery store after hours talking and hanging out and I think she puts her feet on him during that conversation. Really hoping somebody knows what movie Im talking about, I want to show it to my boyfriend	Early 2000s romcom? Hi everyone! Im trying to remember the name of a movie I saw a few years ago. Its about a guy and a girl who work at a grocery store together. Its one of those cliche movies where the guy and girl are best friends and the guy is in love with her but she doesnt know it. Everything Ive googled keeps giving me Employee of the Month as my answer but Im positive it wasnt that movie. The main girl was brunette and the main guy was somebody that I remember looking similar to James Norton or Zach Gilford.

1lia7bh	Asian Horror Movie	I think this one will be easy. Asian horror movie, foreign language, very tropical jungle setting, follows essentially a witch doctor older lady who worships a deity or a demon at some giant rock statue, her niece or something ends up getting possessed by a different demon, niece ends up getting lost somewhere, she tries performing rituals with her deity to locate the niece, ends up finding the niece but shes too far gone so she asks a different witch doctor to help, the niece ends up being watched at some house but the possession is getting worse, i think she cooks and eats a dog ? They lock her in a closet or something with seals while a ritual takes place off site, the ritual will fail if the seals on the closet are broken or the door is opened, idiot watching her ends up opening the door and the ritual goes completely wrong. Btw, there is one scene where the rock statue is decapitated. I believe symbolizing the spiritual defeat of the deity by the hands of the possessing spirit.

1lblp5v	Laboratory stalker	Very long shot here but I'm trying to name a film I caught late one night a few years back. It was a fairly low budget film about a loner/creepy guy who worked with a woman he was obsessed with or possibly even stalking. He ends up killing her and I think putting her body in the laboratory or clinic that they worked in. I think it's from around the early 2000's although could be later. It had a very cold and clinical feel to it if I remember correctly. Any help very much appreciated!

1l8w79t	Help me find this adult movie  Cinderella porn parody (20002010)	If its not for this subreddit just delete it Hi everyone, Im trying to find a very specific porn parody movie based on the Cinderella fairy tale that I watched around 20072010. It had a strong hardcore vibe and a full-length storyline with multiple explicit scenes. Heres everything I remember about it: The main character (Cinderella) was a white blonde woman with medium breasts, dark eyes, and a very distinctive black beauty mark above her right (or left) side of her upper lip. The stepmother was a white woman, and the stepsister was a black woman (multiracial casting, which was pretty unique for that time). The movie was set in a fairy-tale style, with castle-like settings and period costumes. There was a scene where the stepmother and the black stepsister had a gangbang with two men. After the ball, Cinderella wore a beautiful white dress and performed oral sex on the prince, who then searched for her by the famous slipper. There was also a white wizard character who looked more like a 90s pimp and added a humorous tone to the movie. The movie was definitely full hardcore, not softcore. It was a full-length adult movie, not just a scene compilation. Possibly produced by smaller studios known for fetish and parody films like Devils Film, Pleasure Productions, Exquisite Films, or Heatwave. Ive searched through IAFD, AdultDVD Empire, Reddit, and various adult movie forums but havent been able to find the title or cover art anywhere. If anyone has any idea what this movie might be called or where I can find it, Id really appreciate the help! Thanks a lot in advance!

1kjix0q	Trying to remember a kids movie, possibly a Disney TV movie, about a mean dogcatcher who steals dogs from neighborhoods and a group of kids, teens, I think who are trying to stop him.	All I really remember is the movie is older. I'd guess it came out in the 70's, 80's or early 90's. I know the movie isn't Beethoven but I think there is a similar scene from that movie in the movie I'm trying to remember. That scene is when Beethoven's in the cage, surrounded by other dogs, in the warehouse waiting for the vet to euthanize him before James Grodin's character frees him. This movie had a group of kids, 4 or 5 of them trying to stop the dogcatcher and save the dogs. I don't remember the dogcatchers reason for rounding up all the dogs. I believe he was taking all the dogs in the neighborhood to some kind of kennel/warehouse type building. I think in the beginning of the movie one of the dogs escapes, the group of kids adopt him, and then later they see the dogcatcher recapture him. I believe that's what starts their journey, Also I remember the dogcatcher was a bald headed man. It may or may not have been a TV Disney Movie, like when they aired the The Disney Sunday Movies on tv, like Mr. Boogedy.

Any help would be appreciated. If I was to guess the year I would say anywhere between 1982 to 1995, give or take and absolutely wouldnt be after 2001.

This is a B movie from 80s or 90s, what I remember was: FOR SURE: There were three heroes, they had some sort of suit something like Rocketeer, they fight some other race of humanoid-like enemies, one of them (with a mustache) is captured and taken to the enemy ship (or headquarter). Inside there, there is an enemy woman-humanoid that tries to seduce him then shows him her breasts, the hero says something like ""hey that's my patroller underwear"" to her. I watched it when I was a kid, so I turned off the TV for not be beaten by my mother for watching naked people. The alien enemies skins are all GREEN. NOT SURE: There are spaceships or giant robots involved. The heroes greeted each other with some sort of pose (like Usain Bolt's pose of victory) This movie was exhibited in the afternoon so it´s not a lot of nudity involved, sorry it was one of the few things I remember. I am trying to find this movie for 15 years so any help is appreciated!	Movie about 3 heroes, one of them kidnapped, soft nudity Hi, since now I apologize for my English, I am from Brazil!

1l8czu7	Please Help	I remember as a kid I was watching a movie with my family, but I can't for the life of me figure it out. It's like Dune with the giant sandworms. And in the beginning they're in the desert in a vehicle thats like a golfcart. Pretty sure they were sent there or were trying to see whats in the area, but got ambushed. And was chased into a nest like cave with giant spiders. Then more of these caved started to show up, they were poisonous too. I also remember one got injured and had to just fire from a rock or something to seal the wound. And was then saved from a helicopter. i forget the rest of the movie till they eventually go to a castle with a dragon to stop like a code so they can escape like a virtual reality or something.

1ks843o	Movie with a seance/ medium scam to steal money.	I'm trying to identify a supernatural thriller/mystery film made sometime between 2010 and now. It had dark comedy elements and featured mostly unknown actors. The plot centers around a grieving man who lost his son. Hes manipulated by a woman claiming to be a psychic, who lives in an old mansion. She's clearly running a scam, exploiting his grief to take his money. A notable and strange detail is that later in the film, someone is **poisoned via a large emerald ring that is crushed to powder**, which stands out as a key plot device. The movie wasnt a major theatrical release, maybe indie or direct-to-streaming. The overall tone was eerie but also satirical at times.. Any help would be appreciated!

It was about a guy who was about 40 years old, who lived with his elderly mother in a newly built soviet style concrete high rise block of flats, typical of that era. He got involved in some bad things and could not come home for dinner, probably died or got arrested. His mother kept waiting until the night with a dinner ready for him, sitting by the table. In the last scene we see the lights on that block windows turning off as everyone goes to sleep only to be left with just a single window with the lights still on. What movie was that?

Another scene: the mother asked her son to go ask the father for money for tea, and the Dad picked up dirt from the ground and put it in his hand. The characters spoke Arabic, and the women wore hijabs. I think it may have taken place in Lebanon, Syria, or Afghanistan. Any ideas? Thank you!

His reply is along the lines of a man relying on himself sometimes.

She had a daughter or a sister that the detective grew close to and sympathized with I think because she was younger. To his shock She eventually told the detective she had murdered her and also held up a bag with a fetus inside of it because the woman she murdered was pregnant and she cut her baby out of her.

1li6xk4	¿Alguien recuerda el nombre de esta película de vampiros?	Hola, estoy buscando el nombre de una película que vi hace varios años, pero no logro recordarlo y me encantaría volver a verla. Recuerdo que trataba sobre un niño que se convierte en vampiro. De pequeños, él y una niña humana hicieron un pacto de amor con sangre, cortándose la mano y dejando una cicatriz como símbolo. Pero al padre de la niña no le gustaba esa relación, así que una noche golpeó brutalmente al niño, casi hasta matarlo. Mientras el niño moría en el bosque, otro vampiro lo encontró y lo transformó. Años después, la chica regresa como adulta (unos 20 o 30 años) al lugar donde vivieron. El niño, que sigue teniendo la misma edad porque es vampiro, la reconoce gracias a la cicatriz. Ella también lo reconoce, y recuerdan el pacto que hicieron en la infancia. No recuerdo si estaba en español original o doblada. La vi en DVD hace tiempo. ¿Alguien sabe cómo se llama?	¿Alguien recuerda el nombre de esta película de vampiros?

1leyock	Twins but one is evil	I have this very vivid memory of this movie scene and I cannot figure out what movie it is from. I dont remember my age when I saw it but I know I was under or about 10, so definitely in the mid 90s, though the movie could be earlier than that bc I saw it on tv. There are 2 blonde child sisters, they are most likely twins. The scene is at a church, the good twin is locked in a coffin (or box) and the room is filling with smoke, definitely on fire. Shes screaming and kicking and trying to escape. The evil twin goes into the church (full of people) for her First Communion. Im assuming this is the event and that its Catholic but I grew up Lutheran so I cant say for sure, because she is in a white dress, with a lace white head piece (that looks like a napkin, its flat and resting on her head but its not a veil) and when she proceeds into the church with the other kids, they go to the front, kneel, hands in prayer, and take a communion wafer. The scene keeps flashing between the girl in the burning coffin and this girl getting communion. There is definitely a sense that the evil twin put the good twin in the coffin and set it on fire and that she took the good twins spot in the communion line. Thats all I remember, possibly because I heard a parent heading towards the tv room and changed it quick. Please help me, its been driving me bananas that I cannot figure out what this movie is! Update: Alice Sweet Alice!! You all rock! I found the movie on Prime and found the scene, definitely slightly different than I remember but my poor traumatized kid brain filled stuff in and completely blocked out the creepy yellow slicker. Thank you!!!	Twins but one is evil I have this very vivid memory of this movie scene and I cannot figure out what movie it is from. I dont remember my age when I saw it but I know I was under or about 10, so definitely in the mid 90s, though the movie could be earlier than that bc I saw it on tv. There are 2 blonde child sisters, they are most likely twins. The scene is at a church, the good twin is locked in a coffin (or box) and the room is filling with smoke, definitely on fire. Shes screaming and kicking and trying to escape. The evil twin goes into the church (full of people) for her First Communion. Im assuming this is the event and that its Catholic but I grew up Lutheran so I cant say for sure, because she is in a white dress, with a lace white head piece (that looks like a napkin, its flat and resting on her head but its not a veil) and when she proceeds into the church with the other kids, they go to the front, kneel, hands in prayer, and take a communion wafer.

1lcjg6v	Bizzare 80's Sci-Fi Animation	I remember seeing this bizarre Sci-Fi animation, I think it was from the 80s or maybe later, not sure. Anyways, there was this scene where some sort of space-trooper or mercenary was dying, bleeding out, maybe? in a red pool of some sort of liquid. He was wearing some sort of distinctive headgear, and unbeknownst to him, it had become stuck in the trigger well of some rifle just under the surface of the water. He was trying to get up and was unable to- but ended up jerking the rifle's trigger, causing it to spurt out bubbles from below the water. The man still hadn't seen the rifle, but noticed that when he tried to dislodge his head from whatever was in the water, it would begin to bubble softly. So he would simply nod his head, and watch the water bubble up, and he began to smile, laugh even. In the face of death. The scene was beautiful and it really stuck with me, but I have no idea what it was from. Post accompanied by illustrations from my memory.

1klmwbl	Canadian absurd comedy	I watched this one over the pandemic on Prime. I remember most of the details but being that I'm fairly sure it's a Canadian indie film, it's been hard to find. The main character is a young man who cleans houses (poorly). He awkwardly bikes to these jobs carrying all his gear. One of his customers is a blind guy who he routinely rips off. He's incredibly weird. There's a scene early on where him and his friends are wrestling in the living room and taking things way too far. He meets a homeless girl and since his parents are out of town he lets her stay with him if she helps him with his cleaning business. The girl ends up drinking enough booze to give herself alcohol poisoning. The climax takes place at an army recruitment office.	Canadian absurd comedy I watched this one over the pandemic on Prime.

1l4dqzs	60s/70s movie about teenage couple	Watched a film years ago on Netflix about a teenage couple who'd fallen in love. I thought I remembered that she had gotten pregnant and was sent to a convent. Her boyfriend rescued her (by either storming in and taking her away or something to do with the window in her room), they ran away together and got married. The film then took a depressing turn and got kinda dark. All I remember is the boyfriend hitting the woman at some point during the film and it seemed like they were living in a shitty apartment in a city like New York (I remember lota of dark alleyways) I feel like it was a low budget 60s/70s American movie. I also think both main characters had dark hair.	60s/70s movie about teenage couple Watched a film years ago on Netflix about a teenage couple who'd fallen in love.

1lfjr9c	Help IDing horror movie reference in game.	Here's a weird one. This is a scene from a game (Kathy Rain 2: Soothsayer) that references a few movies with posters. We've got Bram Stoker's Dracula and Edward Scissorhands. Then a third poster that I cannot place. The game dialogue references it as a zombie movie from 1973, that received a remake (presumably in the 90s). The game is set in 1998, and references Edward Scissorhands as having ""just come out,"" so the timeline isn't perfect. It's possible it's a generic stand-in for film cliches (the characters have a little back and forth about the original vs remake, movie snob stuff), but it also looks super familiar to me. My initial thought was Zombi, but I couldn't find a matching poster and the others are pretty 1:1 pixel recreations. Zombi is '79, but again, the timeline is a little funky. Help me out, here. I don't wanna write it off as a made-up prop for the scene without exhausting my resources first.	Help IDing horror movie reference in game. Here's a weird one.

1ljxj8m	I can't sleep without finding out the movie =-I	I'm looking for a recent Arabic film (post-2010) in which a painter stays at a hotel, only to discover that all the other guests are also trapped there, unable to escape. The only way for anyone to leave is if all the rooms are occupied. The protagonist is the last guest, and after being drugged and covered in honey (not killed), he is sacrificed in a ritual by the other guests. He then becomes the new manager of the hotel, bound to wait for new guests to fill the rooms, continuing the cycle. There is also a significant scene where the old manager shows the protagonist a jellyfish, using it as a metaphor to explain that they, like the jellyfish, are immortal, trapped in an endless loop. Additionally, all the guests are weird and eccentric, with one lady bringing a puppet of her dead son, treating it as if it were alive. The artist promises her to draw a picture of her dead kid. The child died cause he tried to run away from the hotel and she is very disturbed due to it. There is also a female guest a very good looking one, the artist tries to start a sexual relationship with her but fails, at that He doesn't know that she is like 150 years old, as once trapped into the hotel u don't age just like a jellyfish The movie ends as him being the new manager and letting in new guests The morning breakfast in that movie used to fresh honey and bread	I can't sleep without finding out the movie =-I I'm looking for a recent Arabic film (post-2010) in which a painter stays at a hotel, only to discover that all the other guests are also trapped there, unable to escape.

1lfzzai	Help me to find this movie	A film about a teenager who is beaten and robbed by a group of thugs on a local playground. Later he practices boxing and takes revenge on them one by one, beating them up. He meets one of them on a sports field and the other in a store. I only saw a fragment of the film somewhere on Facebook. The first guy he took revenge on was also beaten with a sock filled with money or rocks. The title may have included the word ""rhinoceros"", but I'm not sure. Most of them, if I remember correctly, had dark hair and darker skin like from Morocco or Turkey, but the setting is Europe or the States.

1livoem	I can't remember the movie/series name	I want to watch a series/movie I watched years ago, I think it was around or after 2020/23 but I can't remember the name of it.I remember this from the plot - a group of strangers are invited to a mysterious vacation on a tropical island.The place they stayed wasn't big like a hotel or anything. It was more like a wooden villa and they had a pool (I think they killed someone in it if I'm not mistaken). So things don't go well and they start killing them one by one with the killer leaving some kind of messages about crimes that the guests had committed before.I think the crime of one of the women there was that she accidentally killed her daughter-in-law by electrocuting her.Everyone wonders who the killer is but in the end I think it was the woman who actually invited them to the island.I don't remember what her whole idea was but it had to do with the fact that her husband (maybe her father? I know it was someone close to her but I don't know exactly who) was an incredible artist but he dressed differently and when he had a heart attack on the street everyone thought he was homeless and didn't do anything.If an ambulance had been called sooner he would have survived or at least that's what she thinks.Her entire monologue was basically about how people are selfish monsters and that's why she decided to start killing people who haven't met justice for their actions.How she found out about the crimes of the people on the island, no idea but that's all I remember from it.That and a machete that I'm sure they used to kill a few people. Thank you if you read all that and for any possible information.

1lbdwrt	Movie about a relationship gone way wrong.	My wife is trying to find a movie, I've never heard of it. We can't find anything about it (so I low key think she made it up). It's about a guy and a girl who are dating, and she handcuffs him to the bed for sexy times - however, it's revealed he perceives the relationship as ""just fooling around"", and she thought they were getting serious. So, in an attempt to get him to commit to her, she leaves him handcuffed and sort of attempts to 'Misery' the guy. Eventually her friends get involved, murdering him becomes a topic, and things spiral out of control. I'd be happy to watch it with her. Sounds funny. But at this point I think she made it up.

In a later scene, she hits one of the men responsible with her car, gets out of the car and shows him a picture of her daughter and says her daughters name. She then says something along the lines of ""run away if you can"", then gets back in the car and reverses over him. The end of the movie takes place at a mansion (likely the same one as earlier in the movie) she has a shootout with a man and finally kills him, then she chases the younger woman from earlier in the movie. The younger woman falls on a tiled patio area and the protagonist aims her gun at her. She plans to kill her because she is the daughter of the man responsible for her daughters death. The two of them talk and the younger woman reveals her own dad did awful thinfs to her when she was younger. The father turns up and points his gun at the protagonist, but the younger woman tells her father she will kill her. The younger woman stands aiming her gun at the protagonist, then at the last second she shoots her father. The protagonist jumps on top of him and repeatedly stabs him until he is dead. I didn't watch the entire thing, I just saw my dad watching part of it when visiting their house but my Google searches are coming up fruitless, to the point it seems the movie doesn't actually exist.

It is about a boy whose mother has Alzheimers and he has to learn how to deal with it. He finds joy in a seemingly abandoned art installation in the forest of different colored bottles hanging from ropes or wires. Near the end of the film, he finds out his mother has gone missing and he finds her at their old home. He is happy because a part of her is still in there.

The dancing becomes increasingly frenetic and fun.	two teens meet, dance I briefly saw this clip on insta of a 1960s black-and-white movie scene. Two young teens meet on the street.

1kdcrld	Haunted by: Couple attacked in a trailer in cold weather	So I remember watching a movie but not finishing it and it's killing me I don't know what it is. The scene I remember: There's a couple in bed - for some reason I remember them being emmy rossum and Jon Bernthal - but it wasn't them She is wearing a giant coat, with no pants, presumably because they're in such a cold place, and he's in boxers maybe. The other thing I feel like I remember is that they appeared to be in an rv or a trailer or something. He gets up and opens the door to step out of their bedroom into a common area. For some reason there's like 3 to 5 guys in this room, who he knows. They catch sight of her in bed in a GIANT COAT through the open door, and although main guy does nothing to escalate, and is clearly wary of these men, they attack him. Not only this but they manage to knock him out and SA her. She tries to fight them off, but can't. When he comes to, he pulls them off her, and they all just kind of start in on him, but he's doing his best. In the meanwhile she is able to make a run for it, and the whole time she's leaving through the door of the trailer or the rv or whatever, he's looking at her and she's looking at him and there's this vibe that tells you that they both know he's about to die. But the fact that she was SAed is his fault (maybe) so it's okay. I know, really weird random and dark but this scene, the emotion as she leaves in the end, it haunts me.

My memory is probably not the most reliable, but if any of this sounds familiar I would like to know what you think! I remember watching tv with my dad as a kid. One night we were looking for something to watch. We stop on a show or movie. A psycho man (and who I believe was his daughter) kidnapped an old man in a grocery store parking lot. The old man wakes up in a dim room, strapped to a chair. The psycho goes on about god or whatever. He then says that god was mad at him, before beating the old man to death with a hammer or axe. My dad covered my eyes and quickly changed the channel. But I remember being intrigued and curious ever since. Im still very curious where this scene came from.

The first part that I saw but did not see the continuation was about an advanced race of aliens that that notice an asteroid that is going to destroy earth. The deliberate as to saving earth by diverting the asteroid but the leader asks to send one of them to Earth, Florida, to better understand if earth is worth saving. Then there were scenes of kids with a nanny and the mom fires the nanny and calls for a new nanny, this time a male. Everyone confuses the new alien thinking it is the new nanny. The alien saves one of the kids from drowning and later heels another when she was hurt playing soccer. It was somewhere on a fire stick but not whick app. It had a low budget feel but seemed very recent. I can't remember the name and I want to see the other part or the continuation.

1kfp56x	Dragons, Goblins and violence.	A movie that's a faint memory from my childhood. All I remember is: the movie starts off with the main group of characters(3 people at least) being attacked by a goblin (I don't remember if the evil creatures in this movie were goblins orcs or something else) and then the attacker is taken out by another character with an arrow. There are 2 talking (i think red) dragons in this movie a male and female, the male is I think the main villain while the female appears to be confused(but they are a team), at some point the villains kidnap children who the female dragon thinks are her children , then at the finale fight the male dragon burns an army and one of the protagonists tells the female dragon ""look [males name] is killing your young!"" They have a fight and I don't remember anything else. The movie is 3d animated and old(maybe late 90s to mid 2000s) , it was also very violent and scary to me as a kid.	Dragons, Goblins and violence.

1ld3f13	Repost - creepy animated kids movie	I remember randomly watching this movie, because it was being broadcast on the danish kids channel called DR Ramasjang. It must have been around 2012-2014 as far as I remember. I dont remember the movie in its entirety, but I'll try to go through it as good as I can. I remember the movie being computer animated, but I dont think that it was very high quality computer animation. The movie starts out with our main character being a young girl who loves and looks up to her parents. I remember the girl sitting at a vanity with her mother, admiring how beautiful she thinks that her mother is. It goes on like that for a bit, with her loving and admiring her parents. But as our main character gets older she starts to think less and less of her parents. Now she finds them embarrassing, and annoying, she even starts to find them ugly, and gross. Later in the movie she gets a boyfriend, which is a huge relief for her because finally she can be around someone her own age. At some point her boyfriend gets a facial piercing, which inspires the main character to get one for herself. Her parents are however not happy with this, and this is when the movie starts to get really weird. Her father starts talking about how she can get her piercings for free, if she lets him pierce her face. He then goes on to demonstrate how he will do so, by laying the mother down on the dinner table, then taking a hand drill, and drilling screws into the mother's face. After that both of the parents start to chase the main character and her boyfriend around the house. Trying to escape from them, the main character and her boyfriend climb up the chimney of her house, but an explosion goes off in the background, and the movie hits a sort of reset. We then see similar scenarios where the main character and her boyfriend tries to escape her crazy parents, right up till a point where theyre once again climbing the chimney. The main character then comes to the conclusion that if she wants to escape her parents shell have to kill them, she then breaks the fourth wall and looks directly at the viewer, and then says something along the lines of, dont worry, its just a cartoon. I remember being really freaked out by this part. I dont really remember much of the movie after that, but I do remember seeing the end credits roll. I dont really remember what the characters looked like, but Im pretty sure that the mother wore a long green dress with pink dots. I also cant exactly say where the movie was from, but the version I saw was dubbed in danish. Im pretty sure that the movie comes from a western country, either that or its east European. I really hope that someone can help me find this movie, because Ive been searching for it for years now. I remember that the channel would broadcast lesser known animated movies. I for example do remember seeing the movie Anna and the Moods on the channel, which is a somewhat similar movie, but its definitely not the one that im looking for.

Trying to escape from them, the main character and her boyfriend climb up the chimney of her house, but an explosion goes off in the background, and the movie hits a sort of reset. We then see similar scenarios where the main character and her boyfriend tries to escape her crazy parents, right up till a point where theyre once again climbing the chimney. The main character then comes to the conclusion that if she wants to escape her parents shell have to kill them, she then breaks the fourth wall and looks directly at the viewer, and then says something along the lines of, dont worry, its just a cartoon. I remember being really freaked out by this part. I dont really remember much of the movie after that, but I do remember seeing the end credits roll. I dont really remember what the characters looked like, but Im pretty sure that the mother wore a long green dress with pink dots. I also cant exactly say where the movie was from, but the version I saw was dubbed in danish. Im pretty sure that the movie comes from a western country, either that or its east European. I really hope that someone can help me find this movie, because Ive been searching for it for years now. I remember that the channel would broadcast lesser known animated movies. I for example do remember seeing the movie Anna and the Moods on the channel, which is a somewhat similar movie, but its definitely not the one that im looking for.

1l593ht	not the oceans movie	I couldve bet money on it that this took place in one of the oceans movies but it does not. I distinctly remember a scene where the group of guys were hanging out in the backyard (of a nice house) talking about how sad it was that there friend had passed away and all the fun they used to have. some how they get to talking about doing one last thing in honor of that friend or in revenge for that friend? I really thought it was the old guy Saul (I literally said RIP when he showed up in Oceans Eleven =- how rude of me). While watching Oceans Thirteen (light spoilers ahead I guess, the movie did come out in 2007) Reuben does have a heart attack but he gets better and ends up participating. Now I am racking my brain trying to recall what movie I thought I was thinking about. I dont think it was a war movie, nor do I think it was any of the Fast&amp;Furious.	not the oceans movie I couldve bet money on it that this took place in one of the oceans movies but it does not.

1la7qzs	Movie with gems and jewels falling from mountain rock	So, I remember watching a movie pre-2005. On TV, in Canada. The thing that I most remember is a mountain pass of some kind bewitching people, with gems and jewels of all kinds falling from the rock as the people were bewitched. I think it was set in medieval times or middle ages or something, there were swords, it wasn't in English I don't think, and I think there was a woman named Milena/Melena/Malena. I most remember people riding horses into the mountains and through the pass, with the gems and jewels falling. This movie has, on and off, driven me mad as I try to remember what the movie could be.

I think it was about former soldiers that are being repurposed for new jobs. They have to do wellness reports to prove they wont become traitors and are fit to keep working. The main character meets a female character and together they work against the organization they are serving. At the end of the show the main character sneaks off base (I think by train) to an old space ship graveyard to steal parts. When he gets there hes ambushed because the female character betrayed him. I think the main character was a scientist and maybe they did some sort of memory wipe? Please help Im struggling so much here.

The older sister was raped, and the younger sister hid in the bathroom or a cabinet. ûYears later, the older sister is in a hospital or care home, supposedly with the mental capacity of a child due to trauma. ûThe younger sister works and studies to support both of them and also has a love interest, but she cant fully commit because of her responsibilities. ûThe hospital staff secretly know that the older sister is faking her mental condition, but the younger sister doesn't know. ûIn the final scene, the truth is revealed during a confrontation between the sisters near a hill or pond by the hospital. ûThe film had a blue-toned or grayish color palette, and I remember seeing train scenes, which makes me think it was set in Japan. ûThere were no graphic or mature scenesit focused more on the emotional and psychological aspects. The title might have been left untranslated or was in English, not a full Tagalog title. If anyone remembers this film or saw it on TV during that time, Id appreciate any help identifying it!

Once he got there, his buddies refused to let him in out of fear of being affected by what he just set off.

1lif14y	2005 - 12 Animated kids Trains related movie	Animated kids movie. Around 2005- 12 Animation is similar to polar express. Storyline: Opening: Bunch of kids run and sneak into a train station.

The other scene was when she was in a house and it was closed off. There were news reporters outside and lots of people wondering what was going on in the house. The main girl was inside hiding under a desk. There was a phone on the desk and it rang and she reached up from under the desk. When she was about to grab the phone the blue demon came and smashed her hand preventing her from grabbing it. The blue demons looked asain people with black eyes. I thought Hailey cuoco was the main actress but I might be wrong. I remember this scaring me so much as a kid and want to rewatch as an adult.

And the movie ends with the superpowered guy turning on the scientist and destroying the lab. The superpowered guy may have been named Frank.

The passenger next to the protagonist is a cable sales rep (electrical/phone/data cablesvarious types of cables) who demos his insanely long, ultra-durable cables and just wont quit. Later in the film, the hero actually uses that same long cable to solve a problem (maybe to anchor something), but I cant remember exactly how. A few other clues: Shouldn't be James Bond or Die Hard (or any of their sequels). Not an Italian film  should be international/Hollywood. The salesman is very insistent and carries some cables as samples with him on the plane. Does this ring any bells? Thanks in advance!

The character performs shows where she claims to talk to the afterlife when she doesn't, in a scene she is pulled up by a stage trick to make the audience think she's levitating before she falls from a malfunction. She travels from city to city doing these shows. Theres a scene in a hotel room with a bowl of crystals. The tone is not horror, maybe drama or mystery? The movie is set between the 1920s and 1940s.

1kq4lw2	[TOMT][Movie/TV Show][2000s?] Scene where boys line up to pair with girls at a danceone gives a thumbs up, another gives a thumbs down	Hi everyone, Ive been trying to remember the name of a movie or TV show I watched years agoprobably sometime in the 2000s, but Im not 100% sure. There was a scene set at what I believe was a girls boarding school, and there was a formal dance or social event happening. Boys from a nearby school arrived and were lined up opposite the girls, and they were pairing off one by one to go into the dance area. Heres the part I clearly remember: One of the boys gets paired with a girl, and after taking her hand, he subtly puts his hand behind his back and gives a thumbs up. Another boy does the same but gives a thumbs downlike a secret signal to the others about whether he liked his partner or not. Some of the other boys laugh in reaction. It was a quick moment but really stood out, and Ive been racking my brain trying to figure out what its from. Im not sure if it was a comedy, drama, or maybe even a teen rom-com. Any help would be seriously appreciated!

The movie ends with the computer continuously speaking and printing 'I want to die.'

The two scenes I remember from the TV trailer: \- Scenes set in medieval times, in a medical college where the students are discussing the four humours. \- A modern-day detective scene where one detective is holding a padlock and saying that it hasn't been cut through, but bitten through It's entirely possible I'm combining two movies in my head, misremembering the name, various other Mandela effect things.

1lg68cw	Minimalistic all-talk sci-fi with three actors	I saw it on TV before 2005. Maybe it is not a movie, but an episode of an anthology series. There are only three characters in the movie: 1. a test pilot recovering after a crash, he has some problems remembering stuff. He also cannot believe he survived the crash. 2. a psychologist or something like that who is asking questions about what happened 3. a nurse, Everything takes place in one or maybe two interconnected rooms. When the pilot is remembering his last flight, there are come TRON-style CGI (grids, etc.). It ends with the pilot opening the door out and discovering there is nothing there.

You cant get very close to it for some reason. Only one girl is able to get close to it. Pretty sure it was sandy there. I think the next scene is a cut to that girl as an adult.

Then one day he lets her up in the living room and tells her she can go. Instead of running she says she wants to stay with him. He gets upset and forced her to go. Screaming at her to leave. She eventually does and gets picked up. Once shes with the police she ends up finding out the guys a serial killer who does this with women normally. Except usually theyll run when given the chance and she didnt. So he let her go. The movie ends with him chasing down his next victim.	Kidnapping thriller movie? So I watched this movie awhile ago.

1k5dzzg	Indie horror mockumentary?	EDIT: I TRACKED IT DOWN. It was called Long Pigs! Thank you to those who commented. The movie's premise is that a serial killer allows two(?) film makers to follow him and document a day on the life. One of the first scenes has them all in the killer's basement, with him showing off how he dissects a woman's body. At the time, I wasn't able to watch past that. It had a sort of satirical tongue-in-cheek feel to it, like it was supposed to be just another casual documentary but about horrifying subject matter that doesn't fit the tone. I remember the whole thing was available on youtube but I can't remember the title for the life of me. It might have had something to do with butchering, but I'm not 100% on that.

1klmiua	chinese? language movie with female protagonist who gets pregnant	I saw this movie when I was a kid on an airplane while looking over at my mothers screen and have had dreams abt it ever since. Def a drama, I remember it being so tragic, I dont think it ended well for her (maybe she dies or disappears or gets sick or smth but it was a very hard realistic ending) I think it involves a woman and her childhood friend but there might have been a love triangle as well. There is a sex scene where they are outside in a body of water. Because of this she gets pregnant very young and I think has to raise the child on her own. At the end we flash forward in time a bit, and there is a reunion of sorts. someone either the mom or the child runs into a man who could be the father or someone they thought was the father? Not exactly sure, but I think this reunion happens at a train station for some reason My memory of the plot is VERY murky and its possible that Im remembering details that were added in my dreams lol so some of this might be off. The pregnancy and the sex scene is the only thing Im certain of bc it was my first time seeing ppl have sex in a movie and I was traumatized by her accidental pregnancy =- I vaguely remember the lighting/filter being a cold greenish hue for some parts. Im pretty sure its a Chinese movie& it could have been another Asian country but my mum speaks Cantonese and mandarin and usually doesnt like watching foreign movies (bc reading subtitles). So likely Chinese, but not necessarily mainland China, just Chinese speaking diaspora I cant have been older than 10 (20 now) so its definitely a movie from before 2015 and after the 90s.	chinese? language movie with female protagonist who gets pregnant I saw this movie when I was a kid on an airplane while looking over at my mothers screen and have had dreams abt it ever since.

Theres also a scene where the evil alien baby is running to towards someone with a spear? The baby looked humanoid but was completely hairless, had big black eyes, sharp teeth and always looked wet. This memory has been stuck in my mind for decades! Please help, I cant find it, every time I try to find it, Alien comes up. If it helps, it was around mid-90s to early 2000s when I saw this commercial, so its definitely before then. Thank you all for your help!	Scary alien movie who emerges from a woman Hello!

The autistic guy is badly bullied throughout the movie and treated like trash by family and the other white boy from the trio (whos either his cousin or former best friend or something). Eventually he snaps and goes on a science fiction version of a mass shooting.

1lh0bg2	Possibly MFTV movie? About a runaway teen who lives on the street?	It was one I saw on tv maybe once or twice, I want to say in the mid 90s. The teen runs away after his stepmom is abusive. He is sleeping on a bench when he gets his backpack stolen. He meets another group of teens, starts a sort of relationship with one of the girls, but she most of them get arrested and he loses them. He meets another teen who earns money doing tricks, but helps him find a safe place to stay. The runaway eventually turns tricks, but is caught, sent to a group home and meets the girlfriend again. I think she find out about how hes earning money and is upset. (Some details are hazy, and vague so sorry.). I think it was Toronto is where they were, but guessing. Came up in my brain after recently finding out a friends son ran away due to mental and family health issues. He was found and is safe, but not after he lost all his stuff after sleeping on a park bench. (My friends son is safe and staying with his older sibling)	Possibly MFTV movie?

1lgooe4	Weird, serious monster(?) film w/ people avoiding monsters and getting helped by military dudes?	This isnt something Ive watched before in full, but I saw a strange film or show at a bar while watching bands play. Obviously it was too noisy for me to hear any identifiable dialogue. A list of stuff I saw in it when I occasionally glanced at it (I was watching the bands at the same time the film was playing): * It had a somewhat lower visual quality, like a film from early 2010s, 2000s, or earlier * First thing I saw was a girl with red eyes on the ground, struggling while fighting a guy * someone tied onto the top of a car as it drove in circles around someone else * Three people (man, woman, young girl) were being driven away to somewhere by a guy in a camo military uniform * These three people were also being threatened by this other man somewhere outside, which was why the military dude shot him and saved them. * The guy running around alone in the room was also growling and had blood on his face in closer shots, which made me think this was some zombie movie, vampire movie, or smth else like that?? But there were no fangs that I saw, and the monster(?) people werent rotting like typical zombies. * Also, the woman ended up kissing a man who has blood on his face. Then, while they were kissing, another lady came in and broke a glass bottle over the mans head. I was curious just b/c seeing it at the bar while everyones happy and playing fun music was just a silly, weird juxtaposition to me idk lol like what was that. And I didnt even really understand what was happening	Weird, serious monster(?) film w/ people avoiding monsters and getting helped by military dudes?

1klml75	Chinese (?) language movie where female protagonist gets pregnant young	I saw this movie when I was a kid on an airplane while looking over at my mothers screen and have had dreams abt it ever since. Def a drama, I remember it being so tragic, I dont think it ended well for her (maybe she dies or disappears or gets sick or smth but it was a very hard realistic ending) I think it involves a woman and her childhood friend but there might have been a love triangle as well. There is a sex scene where they are outside in a body of water. Because of this she gets pregnant very young and I think has to raise the child on her own. At the end we flash forward in time a bit, and there is a reunion of sorts. someone either the mom or the child runs into a man who could be the father or someone they thought was the father? Not exactly sure, but I think this reunion happens at a train station for some reason My memory of the plot is VERY murky and its possible that Im remembering details that were added in my dreams lol so some of this might be off. The pregnancy and the sex scene is the only thing Im certain of bc it was my first time seeing ppl have sex in a movie and I was traumatized by her accidental pregnancy =- I vaguely remember the lighting/filter being a cold greenish hue for some parts. Im pretty sure its a Chinese movie& it could have been another Asian country but my mum speaks Cantonese and mandarin and usually doesnt like watching foreign movies (bc reading subtitles). So likely Chinese, but not necessarily mainland China, just Chinese speaking diaspora I cant have been older than 10 (20 now) so its definitely a movie from before 2015 and after the 90s.

1lcoi7m	Villain pulls multiple large levers in industrial room to cut power to a building	Trying to identify a movielikely from the 1980s or 1990s. Theres a scene that I'm sure takes place early in the film where a henchman enters a small industrial or utility roomgreyish, mechanical, kind of dimand pulls multiple large mechanical levers by hand in rapid succession to kill power to the building. The levers are arranged in rows (three in each row presumably?) and each one makes a loud chunk or clunk sound when pulled in a specific order. My mind is saying Die Hard, but I'm not entirely sure. Thanks.	Villain pulls multiple large levers in industrial room to cut power to a building Trying to identify a movielikely from the 1980s or 1990s.

1lits92	Possibly SciFi or Fantasy Body Snatcher type film?	My brother asked if I remembered this film and it's driving me crazy. He said the only moment he remembers is a male character hugging either his wife or child and then realizing it is not the real wife/child. He pulls out of the hug and tells the being (?) or whoever/whatever they are, ""You read her diary, didn't you?"" Does this sound familiar to anyone? It's not either version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers and not necessarily sci-fi; it could be just another human impersonating the wife/child - he's not sure of genre.

1l8a1yl	Animated movie with a wolf in Alaska	Hi. I've been on Google search and even asked chat gpt for ages but I can't find the movie. It is a movie about a little puppy, he was abandoned as a baby. I don't know what happened but he lived outside. Was sad most of the times and lived in a very snowy place. I remember people telling him to move over while passing by but his life turned around as an adult and he became like a trusted wolf. He was grey , with a dash of white or maybe even a dark blue colour. I remember him having a family of his own as an adult. The houses were mostly brown wooden cottage houses. It gave a very vintage animation feeling. I watches this on DVD back in the day so the cover had the wolf standing in this very brave and prideful dog type of manner. Confident maybe. I remember little about this but I hope someone has seen this too. EDIT: Thank you so much to everyone that helped me. I found the answer. It is the 1997 version of White Fang by Good Times Entertainment.	Animated movie with a wolf in Alaska Hi. I've been on Google search and even asked chat gpt for ages but I can't find the movie.

It was about an older man and his wife who I remember as very domineering. They hate each other and end up dividing their house with tape but it doesn't stop them fighting and the man ends up snapping and killing his wife. I feel like I remember him cutting her up and trying to get away with it but he doesn't and goes to jail. In jail he got super sick and turns out he was terminally ill so he gets released from prison and I think that was the end. Thank you!!	Movie about man killing his wife (?)

Then at some point the dad and uncle see her with the monster and think the monster is hurting her so they shoot the monster. And the monster is holding a sign that says ""i love you"". Probably late 80s or early 90s. Possibly cable tv. In USA.

1laawt7	Two older scary movies	Wondering if someone can put a name to some horror movies that scarred me as a child. Found several unmarked vhs tapes in the TV cubbard as a child...probably lucky they weren't freakier. They're 2004 or prior, because I was maximum 10 years old but I think I was younger and they were tapes that were copied over so I have no idea how old - it was in color tho! Well, the first movie was set in the dark and there was red lighting so I can't tell based off memory if I could see color on people's shirts or anything but the 2nd movie was in color. 1st movie - Freaky rabid porcupine like beings that could shoot out quills (that I think we're poison?) were chasing a group of people thru a house and chewing thru doors, the lights were red and people were screaming, at this point I tapped out and we turned off the tape. They just kept running into smaller rooms and then up into the attic I think, but maaaybe it was a basement. 2nd movie - Took place in heavy winter on a mountain, sparse cabin community. Out of towner rented a cabin, I remember they had a cake in the fridge...I think it was infested with something. They were warned about people dying on the mountain/a big storm coming in but they just got their groceries and went to the cabin. It's hard to describe the ""scary"" part. It seemed like a black snake-like ooze that body snatched people, but it's been over 21 years since I've seen this and the memory of what it exactly looked like is super hazy. I remember someone does horribly in a grocery store and somehow the ""monster"" follows this moron that's staying staying alone in a secluded-guaranteed to be snowed in cabin. I can't recall if the ""monster"" was really a bad being that hunted people or if it was some kind of virus. I did end up tapping out before finishing it however and I kind of want to torture myself if anyone can find them! I know my descriptions are terrible! Based off my &lt;10 y/o self being frightened for 15 minutes or less, but gooey warm imaginary cookies for anyone that can help me out! <j<j<j	Two older scary movies Wondering if someone can put a name to some horror movies that scarred me as a child.

1klxpg4	Movie my sister rented from blockbuster.	It was about this killer (I believe he was a cop). His kids saw him throw a body into an industrial furnace or forge type thing in a warehouse or something. Cops find a car in the same area body was disposed of but don't find any evidence as the killer used chemicals to wipe away any DNA. I believe the movie started out in a flying pan over a city and follows a car (the killer). It was late 90s early 2000s. Most likely a PG-13 rating.	Movie my sister rented from blockbuster.

Im trying to remember the name of an animated movie I watched as a kid, sometime between 2005 and 2010 (though it might be older). The animation style was similar to Disneys Mulan  more traditional 2D and kind of East Asian in vibe. I dont remember the title or the names of any characters, but heres what I do recall: "" The movie featured demon-like creatures that were summoned from figurines, possibly wooden or statue-like (think small deity idols). "" These creatures werent all evil  some tried to protect humanity, while others tried to destroy it. "" There was a final battle set in a desert. "" It wasnt a series  Im pretty sure it was a standalone, full-length film, possibly released on DVD. Ive been searching everywhere but cant seem to find it. If this rings a bell for anyone, Id be super grateful for any leads! Thanks in advance!

I cannot remember much but there's a scene when two of them come to the private address to put on a show for a rich client. Client is a perverted priest so brunette starts arguing with him. Priest wants both of them to do Salome's dance for him and the brunette said 'no, I will do Salome's dance and she's gonna take you to the river', something like that. Priest then moves behind a large cross sculpture leaned sideways then he starts masturbating behind it while girls dance slowly stripping clothes. This scene was so memorable and I think I would remember faces of these actresses if I see them. I am positive the movie is from 90s and it is a soft core, erotic movie not a porn movie.

He is friends with one of her fathers former students, a man who holds a deep grudge against her family despite once being saved by the pretend husband. As the story unfolds, the grudge escalates into violence when the former student kills the father in the hospital.

1kleg48	A series on Colombian drugs arriving in Europe	Hi everyone, I'm trying to find the name of a TV series (I'm not even sure if it's a series or a movie). Its a European production  I think Spanish or at least set in Spain (but definitely not French). Here's what I remember: The main character is involved in drug trafficking and might be a smuggler or courier. His nickname is ""Pizza"", and I think his first name is Adamo (or something similar). He often breaks the fourth wall and talks directly to the viewer. His girlfriend practices boxing. (Or is it his sister I don't know) They use PGP-encrypted phones (or some kind of secure communication). The show has very beautiful visuals with a little retro gaming style. The series seems to be produced very recently given the quality, maximum 2019 I would say. I've tried searching everywhere but no luck so far. I already tried chatgpt and google image but still nothing.

1l5mkdx	Looking for a horror movie	Hi, im looking for a movie but i dont remember the name, just a scene but kinda blurry. Scene Description: There are two men standing inside a circle made of salt or sand. One of them possibly a priest is holding a book or a Bible. Outside the circle stands a demonic or witch-like woman, unable to cross the line due to the protective barrier formed by the circle. Suddenly, the second man pushes the priest out of the circle. The woman immediately attacks him and bites off his head. His blood flows onto the circle, breaking the protective barrier and creating a kind of bridge. This allows the woman to finally cross over and reach the other man. End scene. This is all i remember. I really would like to see the movie again, but i cant see anything online, not even ai is helping me.

1kbndxy	An animated/CGI movie I watched over 6 years ago	The movie is about two monsters who are friends and befriend a human child (no idea how this happened but I just know they got close to the child and spent a lot of time with the child), forgot if it was a boy or girl. There was a scene where she uses a stick to draw on sand or smth. The two monster argue since one of them doesn't like the kid since it thinks monsters shouldn't be friends with it. Later on, without the other monster knowing, the second monster then tries to kill the kid by throwing it into the ocean off a cliff which is where the two monster friends face off and then the monster who likes the kid kills his monster friend and saves the kid. Also they sorta mutate/turn into a scarier/stronger form in this face off. I've tried to find it but had no luck. Also some of the things I said may not be a fully 100% accurate scene in the movie but I'm confident about the ending Setting: Something like a forest, there was nature so in the wilds	An animated/CGI movie I watched over 6 years ago The movie is about two monsters who are friends and befriend a human child (no idea how this happened but I just know they got close to the child and spent a lot of time with the child), forgot if it was a boy or girl.

1l8a5yi	Animated movie about a bunny walking through an art museum looking at the alphabet	I originally thought this was something I dreamed or imagined, but I spoke to my brother and he said he remembers it, so I know i didn't just imagine this. I can't find it anywhere on the internet, no matter how hard I try explaining it. I'm hoping Reddit people can help: This had to have been on a DVD, because I watched this in the car with a DVD player when I was little. This is the synopsis of what I remember: There was the bunny and he was walking through an art museum. As he walked through the museum, he found different letters. These letters were integrated throughout the art. Some of the art that I remember was the stary night and the painting with the things melting in it. It may or may not have featured the painting titled, A Sunday Afternoon. The letters were in soup, and I think crackers as well, but that may have been a different thing. It was all animated, but not too animated where it was like the animated styles of leap frog. It was a semi-realistic animated style. I don't really know how to explain it. Hopefully what I remember can help.

1l6p0sx	50s/70s Movie LA middle aged man has affair with younger woman and ist secretly photographed. And a high rank military officer in a country house in the dessert	in LA in the 50s or 70s. The movie should be reasonably well known, I've seen it on TV. I know for a fact that a tall, a bit chubby but not fat, rather a massive figure (he wears a classic American suit with a hat, I think the suit was light blue and is middle aged) goes to a Californian multi-party house and has an affair with a younger woman. Maybe the house is light blue maybe the woman is a prostitute. He is either secretly watched or secretly filmed or films himself or is photographed. But I think he is secretly being photographed. Then I have another memory (maybe it's from another movie, but please tell me which one): A high-ranking military man is informed about something at a country house in a desert-like landscape like California and then drives somewhere with a few of his men in a jeep. The high military man is somehow involved in something and is one of the bad guys. Please help me I'm freaking out because I just can't place these memories but I know for sure I've seen this movie(s).

They drive her out but after she is gone, realize she's the most excitement they've had in years. The locals reach out and invite her back, which she does.

1lhy94k	Movie from my childhood i wrote in french bcz it's easier to explain it in french	[FILM D'ANIMATION PERDU] Enfant au pouvoir bleu, village pillé, petite fille avec agneau  ambiance dieselpunk Bonjour ! Je cherche un film danimation, probablement français ou japonais, que jai vu en cassette VHS pendant mon enfance. Voici les éléments dont je me souviens (certaines choses peuvent être imprécises, car ce sont de vieux souvenirs) : Lhistoire suit un jeune garçon (enfant ou ado) qui est formé ou guidé par son père ou son grand-père pour maîtriser un pouvoir bleu. Un méchant ou une armée ennemie possède un pouvoir rouge, plus destructeur. Son village ou sa ville est attaqué ; il est contraint de fuir. Il utilise parfois son pouvoir sans vraiment le contrôler, notamment contre des soldats ennemis. Une scène marquante montre larmée qui pille son village. Les soldats embarquent les habitants et les ressources dans des bateaux en bois. Pendant cette scène, une petite fille tenant un agneau dans ses bras le laisse échapper. Elle court après lui mais un soldat la stoppe et loblige à retourner avec le groupe. À la fin du film, le garçon affronte le méchant. Les pouvoirs bleu et rouge saffrontent dans un combat final, et il finit par gagner. Lunivers était un mélange de fantastique et dieselpunk : je me souviens de véhicules comme des hélicoptères ou voitures en bois, un peu futuristes, mais rustiques. Lambiance était parfois angoissante, pas légère ni comique. Et les voix étaient en français. Je cherche ce film depuis des années, je me demande parfois si je lai rêvé ! = Si quelquun a une idée, je vous en serai énormément reconnaissant !

1l68bz4	Animated Christmas(?) Movie	This had to be a good 20 years ago, but for the life of me I CANNOT figure out the name of this movie, or if it even exists, i feel insane. But it was a 2D animated movie about a toymaker(?) who cut down a wishing tree (or some other sort of fairy tree? Important thing is that he broke some sort of promise to a fairy) and had it turned into a cane of some sort, with a golden orb on top. But there was a very specific plot point about him turning into a monster on Christmas(?) for his crime against this fairy tree, and there was a subplot with a little blonde girl. I caught it on cable at like 3am and only the last chunk of this movie, so idk maybe its not even real but i would love to put this nagging curiosity to rest.	Animated Christmas(?)

The scene shows a male foreigner, likely a European bathing in a Japanese bathtub. A Japanese woman enters the room and the man tries to cover himself. The woman explains that in Japanese culture, ones nakedness is not seen as shameful. Thats all I can remember.

1lcdolz	Made for TV movie, last saw on Lifetime in the mid/late 90s, about a woman dealing with a nightmare MIL with an almost cult of personality family	I remember a lot about this movie except the name so Ill list everything I remember below. The gist of it is that a woman marries a man with the mother of all nightmare MILs. MIL does literally everything in her power to break up their marriage, and she ramps it up when the heroine gives birth to her son. MIL ultimately succeeds in breaking up their marriage when she frames the heroine for infidelity and the husband believes him. Luckily the heroine is able to prove the accusations false during the divorce proceedings and the husband finally believes her, but by then its too late. Later the heroine and husband start going through reconciliation, and the harassment from MIL starts up again. She has the heroine followed (and the heroine write down the license plate on a fortune cookie wrapper but loses it inside her car) and she sends a booklet selling coffins to the heroine. The heroine repeatedly reports the harassment to police but nothing is done. Unfortunately this all culminates in the heroine being killed in a drive-by shooting in her car. The husband knows MIL did it but cant prove it, so he disowns her. Silver lining in all this is that the officer who kept dismissing the heroines claims of harassment becomes hellbent on finding her killer, and after searching her car they find the wrapper with the license plater number. MIL is then finally arrested.

1land5s	Horror movie early 80s	I have been trying to recall a movie that would play a lot on cable in the early 80s. I dont recall much other than it took place either in High School or college and involved a single person trying to summon a devil or some type of demonic power. What I distinctly remember is at some point in the movie the person attempts (or completes) a human sacrifice on a nude red headed female. I do recall it was a full frontal nudity (probably why it still sticks out). The sacrifice took place outside and I believe there was some party going on as well. I thought I hit home when I found the movie Evilspeak as the synopsis sounded similar but alas, no redhead on an altar. Just thought Id give this a shot.

1lclood	Looking for a horror short movie in black and white	Hi! Im looking for an indie Latin American psychological thriller/horror short that Ive seen about 10 years ago. It was hosted for free on a site dedicated to the film, probably made by the director. It was shot in black and white, around 10-15 minutes long, with an unsettling vibe and eerie cool music. I think the title had ~philia in it, maybe referencing a fetish related to surgery or amputation. The story was told from the point of view of a doctor/surgeon who saw himself as a generous, selfless man. He had an MTF trans nurse, a beautiful, cheerful, provocative woman that he called his masterpiece, saying he had done her reassignment and cosmetic surgeries himself. One day, a wounded criminal with a bag of money showed up and threatened him with a gun. The doctor tried to calm him down and offered to help, but the man ended up dead. Other things happened, but I cant remember. (Spoilers from here) The twist was that the doctor wasnt a real surgeon at all. He was a delusional psychopath, maybe a drug addict. The nurse wasnt anything like how he saw her: she looked very masculine and botched from bad surgery, and she hated him because he was threatening to cut off her hormone pills if she ever tried to leave or speak out. The scene with the criminal also played out differently. The man was wounded but not aggressive, he basically handed over the gun willingly. The doctor then shot him and stole his money. Did someone know what Im talking about and ever saw this short?	Looking for a horror short movie in black and white Hi!

1lasyvj	Looking for a film from the 1980s/1990s about a pair of fathers trying to find their kidnapped children.	I the film plot from what I remember is that a young couple are either on holiday or volunteering in South america or Africa and they are kidnapped and either a ranson is not paid or paid but they are not released. One of the father's is ex military, i think ex Vietnam vet. And the other father is a business man or lawyer and either is convince to help the other father or shamed in to it. What happens is they go to a mercenary training camp to train to rescue their children i think its run by the ex military vet mat. During this time the non military father is bullied by another trainee merc or instructor. Later on they go to resuce their children and there is some actions scenes and while trying to rescue their children the non military father is attacked by the bullying mercenary from the training camp. And then I think kills them. They then rescued the children. Possibly the ex military father dies. Does anybody remember this film. Its possibly a straight to vhs or tv movie.

1laqi65	Green door blue princess	Hey everyone. I have a quest that has been haunting me for years. One night when I was a child I woke up on the sofa and my parents had left a movie on. I stayed up for a while to watch it. I have been trying to find the name of the movie for almost 20 years to no avail. I have such specific memories of it I dont think I can have made it up. For reference this would have been in the very late 90s or early 2000s I think. Heres what I remember: A guy (or possibly two guys) end up in some kind of game. The objective is simple: on each level they must find the green door to progress. Each level is different and there are tricks along the way. Ultimately, they must save the princess and escape. If they fail, they die (kind of like a hellscape kind of situation behind the wrong doors). There is some kind of spirit guide / challenger / possibly villain who appears or explains the rules to them but theyre foggy so I wont describe that person. Some very specific bits I remember: - On one of the levels, theres a long white hallway with lots of coloured doors. The main character(s) go through or almost go through the wrong door. They realise a door has been painted green but isnt the correct door. - The beautiful blonde stereotypical princess theyve been following turns out to actually be a demon, and the large blue man theyve been avoiding unzips a skin suit to reveal a stunning blue bald almost alien like princess. Honestly at this point Im wondering if the whole thing was a fever dream but Im sooo hoping Im wrong. Dont fail me hive mind!! TIA	Green door blue princess Hey everyone. I have a quest that has been haunting me for years. One night when I was a child I woke up on the sofa and my parents had left a movie on. I stayed up for a while to watch it. I have been trying to find the name of the movie for almost 20 years to no avail. I have such specific memories of it I dont think I can have made it up. For reference this would have been in the very late 90s or early 2000s I think. Heres what I remember: A guy (or possibly two guys) end up in some kind of game. The objective is simple: on each level they must find the green door to progress. Each level is different and there are tricks along the way. Ultimately, they must save the princess and escape. If they fail, they die (kind of like a hellscape kind of situation behind the wrong doors). There is some kind of spirit guide / challenger / possibly villain who appears or explains the rules to them but theyre foggy so I wont describe that person. Some very specific bits I remember: - On one of the levels, theres a long white hallway with lots of coloured doors. The main character(s) go through or almost go through the wrong door. They realise a door has been painted green but isnt the correct door. - The beautiful blonde stereotypical princess theyve been following turns out to actually be a demon, and the large blue man theyve been avoiding unzips a skin suit to reveal a stunning blue bald almost alien like princess. Honestly at this point Im wondering if the whole thing was a fever dream but Im sooo hoping Im wrong. Dont fail me hive mind!!

1lcpwi3	Australian movie about a teacher and class getting kidnapped.	I saw this movie back in the 80s and three mask men kidnap a group of school children and their teacher. The teacher ends up, killing them, and the movie ends with the children and teacher back at school and the camera pans over to a shelf where there is a frog in a jar of alcohol and maybe a snake and then a human heart. Fade to black, roll credits.	Australian movie about a teacher and class getting kidnapped. I saw this movie back in the 80s and three mask men kidnap a group of school children and their teacher.

It was in black and white and I rememeber it centers around a man who opens these doors down a hallway and they open to very different, odd things happening in each room.

1kvgvxk	Help me to identify this German(?) horror movie with scenes set in a cabin	I would have run into this movie 3 -5 years ago, I'm 26. I think this movie was German, or at least parts of it were in German. I think it was a horror movie, and some of what I remember might have been cobbled together after the fact. But the main thing I remember is that a man was in a cabin or house in the woods, and there are ghosts outside --- maybe of his wife and daughter who died in a fire(?) And a little ghost girl in a long white dress and long hair was pacing outside the house singing an old lullaby in what I'm 99% sure was German. I remember the lyric ""schloss"" being repeated. It's driving me crazy I can't figure out what it was and I've even been scouring YouTube for classic lullabies to see if maybe someone posted a clip of the girl singing the song from there, but no luck. I hope this is enough to go off that someone may have it, what I remember most explicitly is the little girl singing that song while slowly walking back and forth outside the cabin. EDIT TO ADD: I think this movie may have been set in the 19th century? It's also possible the man's wife and child died and then the house he's in is being haunted by this little girl and her mother, but their presence is meant to mirror his own grief and possible guilt over his family's death! Gah! Why is human memory like this!	Help me to identify this German(?) horror movie with scenes set in a cabin I would have run into this movie 3 -5 years ago, I'm 26.

1kfy8k8	Oldish horror movie	Ive been looking for this movie for years now and I think I may of just made it up. I watched it around 2014-2018. In the movie i think there was an older sister or a baby sitter talking care of a little boy. She suspects something creepy is up with him and discovers demonic Symbols written on his back in orange. Like a circle inside a triangle or something like that. Near the end the little boy goes missing and the girl goes outside too look for him and ends up getting killed by zombies. I think she gets backed into a corner where the screen starts abruptly flashing as hands are reaching at her then the movie cuts off. Thats pretty much all I can remember from the movie itself. Id give it about a 40/100 odds that i just imagined it at this point. I specifically remember eating a chicken sandwich in a trailer with no AC in the middle of summer. If anyone also remembers this lmk	Oldish horror movie Ive been looking for this movie for years now and I think I may of just made it up. I watched it around 2014-2018.

1lh4j1g	film from my childhood	Hi, please help me find a movie from my childhood. My brother and I have been looking for it for several years. The movie seemed like a stop motion or puppet show. We saw it on TV, around 2012 - 2016 (the movie may be older) It was a children's story, but when I saw it I was scared The plot that I remember: It was about a young boy, he lived with his parents in a cottage in the woods and there were beehives everywhere outside their house. The boy was probably adopted, he looked a bit like a bear, or he later turned into a bear, and his parents disappeared (I think the ones he lived with didn't like him very much) He was very sad and probably went looking for them. He came across a man and he trapped him in a trailer, later they went somewhere together and a big whale asked them about their most secret wish. the boy was probably afraid of bees the cottage was very simple, only wooden furniture the man was probably from the circus it's a similar vibe to: kuky se vraci 2010 or bear story (gabriel osorio) 2014 bear story has a similar story to the movie i'm looking for, only this was a children's fairy tale i think it was definitely over 30 minutes long I've been searched for this movie for a long time and I can't find it. I would be very grateful for every comment. I searched on Google, asked people on Facebook groups, drew what I remember, messed around with chat gbt, a million word combinations, and failed	film from my childhood Hi, please help me find a movie from my childhood.

There is this handsome guy that lives in some kind of mansion with his mom. Or at least she is a big presence in his life. He has a girlfriend. Her friend goes missing at some point, the guy pretends to be all caring and sad about it, but he was the one who abducted and killed her. I believe the climax occurs on Valentines Day, his birthday, where he has some date with his girlfriend, was possibly intending to propose, and I think she sees something in his big ol mansion that makes her realize he killed her friend. Then maybe she kills him too? Lol. Good luck! Been trying to find this for a long fucking time :)	Handsome guy born on Valentines Day kills his girlfriends best friend???

1l3kbgk	Trying to recall the name of a movie where a woman uttered this line or something similar to it, ""Don't even get me started on corn, only the Aztecs knew how to digest that shit.""	It's mostly in the title but if anybody knows what movie this is I'd really appreciate it. Thanks in advance.

1l52r6x	Need help finding a kid's movie	I went over to visit my Dad in memory care and he was watching some movie on the day room TV. I have no idea what it was, but it seemed to be a kid's movie, and it was interesting enough I'd like to see the whole thing. I only saw one part of it. In the scene, a little blonde boy is standing by the side of the road, when a semi truck pulls up. There is a large black man driving the truck, and he seems to recognize the kid. He opens the door and the kid gets in, and they start chasing another car. Inside the car are a man and woman, who seem to be the villains, and they have a big German shepherd with them that they seem to want for some reason. The semi truck is being chased by other cars (maybe police?) and the truck driver hands some fireworks to the kid and tells him to throw them at the other car, which he does. The police have to stop, and the semi truck follows the bad guy's car down a little country road and blocks them in. The man and the woman get out of the car, and the woman pulls out a gun. The truck driver faces her down and takes the gun away from her. Then he ties up the bad guys and the boy and the dog and the driver all leave together. None of my descriptors seem to return anything on Google. It seemed like a fun movie, so I'm really interested in finding out with what it is.

1ldiq54	A movie I watched on 4KIDS (I think) when I was little and can't remember, for the life of me.	I only remember a scene where the guy comes to table where they're playing some sort of gambling game with dice. The guy places his pet frog/toad on the table claiming it's his lucky charm. The pet extends it's tongue and secretly swallows the original dice while the guy brings out loaded ones. Another scene, towards the movie's ending, I think, shows the guy at the same table without his pet. Someone asks him why he doesn't have his lucky charm. His reply is along the lines of a man relying on himself sometimes. edit: not sure if it's relevant, or if it's 4KIDS, but I remember watching Pocahontas, Last of the Mohicans, White Fang on that same station. Edit: maybe the pet was a chameleon? I think I'm going crazy =-	A movie I watched on 4KIDS (I think) when I was little and can't remember, for the life of me.

1lf26fj	Kid drowns and becomes peter pan? something like that.	Watched this a while ago with the fam and its driving me crazy that I cant remember it. Within the first 30 minutes or so youre introduced to the main family, who has two young boys. Like, 10 ish maybe? Theyre twins I believe. They play outside a lot, and find an old boat that shipwrecked at the edge of the river. They play on it a lot, pretending to either be pirates or be stopping pirates, cant remember. During a storm one of them falls in and gets electrocuted and dies. After the funeral the father gives the living son a watch as a coming of age gift. I dont remember much of the rest of the movie, although at the end the living brother is sitting on a bench in the garden, and keeps hearing and seeing flashes of his dead brother running around him. Somewhere along the way of the movie its implied or said that the brother who died somehow became a sort of peter pan, but again Im unsure of the details. It was a really bittersweet and lovely movie, and Id love to find it again. Thank you in advance!!	Kid drowns and becomes peter pan? something like that.

1l7cgd6	Apocalyptic movie with birds falling from sky dying and charter boat people dead from intense burning	Movie about leaders knowing something going on, having a meeting and birds fly into meeting through windows. Later a large boat is found that has people on it that were killed by what is speculated to be the sun burning them alive, they are covered in boils. Wife thinks it was a tv movie, says it's not the day after tomorror, deep impact, 2012, Armageddon, the core, or the day the earth stood still. She remembers scientists don't want to alarm the public but that's it. This would have came out before 2013. Evertime I come across any end of world movie/show with falling birds I show her and she says no. Maybe reddit can help.
