As I recall, it didn't get recognised or treated but she eventually outgrew it. She went to university - economics, I think - and got a job working in a pub in the evenings to save money, which is where the problem with the alcoholism started. She got married and had children called Chloe and David, followed by a miscarriage. Chloe and the miscarriage were both unplanned pregnancies and there was a whole thing about her being worried in case either the drinking or some sleeping pills her doctor had given her had impacted on Chloe when she was pregnant (Chloe was fine when born). She worked various jobs. I think one was in a bookshop run by a member of her or her husband's family who gave her the job due to her being a family member. At another point, she got a job teaching maths to sixth form students, but found she didn't remember nearly enough of her A-level maths so completely crashed and burned; there was then a complaint from a parent about her smelling of alcohol while teaching, which mystified her as she avoided drinking before work (she realised with hindsight that she was drinking so much in the evenings that she still smelled of alcohol the next day). When she eventually tried to stop drinking, it was hugely difficult and she was under various doctors. At one point she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital (the one where I later worked where there was this copy of the book). Her daughter, now a teenager, was going off the rails somewhat at this point due to the stress.

So, odds are against anyone knowing it... still, I figure it can't hurt to ask. I read this book in 1998, and it was in paperback. I recall the title as being something like 'Out of the Shadows' or 'Out of the Darkness', but unfortunately that's too vague a phrase for me to get anywhere searching it. The author wrote anonymously. As I recall, she gave her surname as 'A', and then, throughout the book, when a character was introduced that she wanted to anonymise (usually a doctor) she would give their surname as the next letter in the alphabet, so we'd get Dr B, Dr C, etc. I have a feeling her first name began with a J - Jean? Joan? Something like that. The book was autobiographical and told the story of her years as an alcoholic and her struggle to give up drinking. Events that I can remember from her life include: She had anorexia for a while in her teens; I think she was at a boarding school at the time but I'm not sure about that. As I recall, it didn't get recognised or treated but she eventually outgrew it. She went to university - economics, I think - and got a job working in a pub in the evenings to save money, which is where the problem with the alcoholism started. She got married and had children called Chloe and David, followed by a miscarriage. Chloe and the miscarriage were both unplanned pregnancies and there was a whole thing about her being worried in case either the drinking or some sleeping pills her doctor had given her had impacted on Chloe when she was pregnant (Chloe was fine when born). She worked various jobs. I think one was in a bookshop run by a member of her or her husband's family who gave her the job due to her being a family member. At another point, she got a job teaching maths to sixth form students, but found she didn't remember nearly enough of her A-level maths so completely crashed and burned; there was then a complaint from a parent about her smelling of alcohol while teaching, which mystified her as she avoided drinking before work (she realised with hindsight that she was drinking so much in the evenings that she still smelled of alcohol the next day). When she eventually tried to stop drinking, it was hugely difficult and she was under various doctors. At one point she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital (the one where I later worked where there was this copy of the book). Her daughter, now a teenager, was going off the rails somewhat at this point due to the stress. She tried Antabuse or something similar - I forget exactly which one - but it had no effect on her.

Here are some details I remember: - I would say it's a second-chance romance because if I recall correctly, they are recently married, but he leaves their honeymoon/vacation trip for some business duties. - The male protagonist is a plant crop scientist (probably a botanist, or a biologist, or even an agronomist) and partner of a high-tech company. - For the scientific goals of his most recent research project, he must be confined in a glass dome facility, much like in the actual Biosphere 2 project. - He and the female protagonist are in a tattered relationship. She left him because his work always comes first in his list of priorities, and she wants to build a family. I can't remember exactly, but my guess is that she works for the press (or not). - By the end of the book, she learns she is pregnant after a brief reconciliation, and there's a scene where she wears a protective suit to talk to him through a glass wall that separates the scientists inside the dome from the exterior world and avoid contamination. I appreciate any help anyone can provide on this.", "category": "unsolved", "thread_id": 23174215}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-09-05T11:09:46.351217Z", "updated_at": "2025-09-13T14:52:38.218682Z", "inner_id": 90, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 24, "updated_by": 5, "comment_authors": [], "stats": {"total_labels": 13, "total_unique_labels": 7, "has_plot": true, "plot_character_length": 1047, "plot_word_length": 183}}, {"id": 26779, "annotations": [{"id": 663, "completed_by": 5, "result": [{"id": "ggijS2hqQ9", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 17, "text": "man", "start": 14, "labels": ["Character(s)"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "jkZ7l1f3TD", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 32, "text": "woman", "start": 27, "labels": ["Character(s)"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "_H8zmdaDWh", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 82, "text": "Years ago I read this fiction book", "start": 48, "labels": ["Release date"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "71H-CEzwYs", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 77, "text": "fiction", "start": 70, "labels": ["Genre"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "660mAy9rMw", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 133, "text": "place that young couples went to elope.", "start": 94, "labels": ["Setting"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "1FHWKzu4eJ", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 141, "text": "The men", "start": 134, "labels": ["Character(s)"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "M1fhC3EzyM", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 178, "text": "the women", "start": 169, "labels": ["Character(s)"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "uK1NVgJT1c", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 306, "text": "The Nursery", "start": 295, "labels": ["Title"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "hQ6zvp-BEz", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 424, "text": "I thought it was called The Nursery but I must be mistaken because putting that into any search engine doesn't return with the storyline that I remember.", "start": 271, "labels": ["Search history"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "3J2IfEiPxf", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 42, "text": "couples elope man murdered woman kidnapped", "start": 0, "labels": ["Plot"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "BOdMTAP08o", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 270, "text": "about this place that young couples went to elope.

I know it was somehow related to marketing and it was divided into stories. From what I recall, there were two stories there. I think the whole book was about someone (I have this idea that the person was maybe a journalist? not 100% sure).

The content was a comprehensive, critical, chronological review of science fiction and fantasy films up to the publication date of the book, which must have been after 1971 since I recall seeing \"\"A Clockwork Orange\"\" pictures in it. I don't recall anything later than that, so year of first publication may have been 1972 or 1973. The book seemed balanced between US and European film, so I suspect it may have been of British origin. I recall a specific photo in the book that disturbed me as a 10 year old: From \"\"A Clockwork Orange\"\" https://www.alamy.com/adrienne-corri-... It MIGHT be this book, but I can't find any info about the content: \"\"Focus on the Science Fiction Film\"\" https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3... It's definitely NOT the following books: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1... https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1... https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2... So, if anyone knows for certain the book, I would be very grateful as I have been wanting to read it again.

Eventually all the kids manage to escape the room and start wandering around the building where they are being held.

A 12-year-old girl wakes up the morning of her 12 birthday with other 12-year-olds, also the morning of their birthdays, and sees that they all have a circle on their forehead. (a plain, smooth, outline of a circle) They are in a plain, square room and cannot seem to find a way out. Eventually all the kids manage to escape the room and start wandering around the building where they are being held. I want to say that they thought all the hallways were going uphill, but I could be wrong. This group eventually runs into another group of kids- also there on their birthday.

It was recommended to me by a bookseller in a children's book shop. My memory fo the plot is vague so I'll do my best. It's set during the war (not sure if I or II) about a teenage girl sent to the rural south coast to stay with, I think, two aunts who live in a little cottage with a much loved garden. The girl might be a little wayward, maybe that's why she's been sent away. She walks the coastal paths regularly and meets a boy/man and they have rendezvous in a cave I think. She might get pregnant and give birth in a tin bath tub with her aunt helping her.

I recently (within the last year) read a firefighter's memoir in which said firefighter describes going on an ocean rescue (general rescue-related; there was no fire) to save a man who had swum out to sea to kill himself. The writer describes the man as being completely emotionless when saved, I think. I'm looking for that specific passage/section in the book. This is a slightly unorthodox request for this group, as I'm pretty sure it's either Fighting Fire or Working Fire . I thought it was the former, but I've just re-checked it out from the library and paged through three times to no avail, and I no longer have Working Fire -- so I'm hoping that 1) somebody who's read Working Fire (or understands how to search for such passages on the Internet better than I do) can confirm the scene before I try to track down a new copy, 2) somebody recognises it from Fighting Fire and can point me in the right direction; or 3) somebody can say, 'no, you fool, it's this other book on your shelves'. I do think the latter's unlikely (am pretty sure the book was by a firefighter, and those are the only two I've read of late), but I'm open to suggestions.

I vaguely remember him having a friend named like Simon or something that FMC talked with, and I DNFed right around the point she was realizing that one of the other wives was getting abused. Oh yeah, the wives were not allowed to communicate with each other. The vibe of the book was more modern and it definitely wasn't YA. I feel like the cover was like greyish blue and depicted three women but I could totally be wrong.
