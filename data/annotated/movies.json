Here\u0019s what I remember: Edit: It is definitely not any of the Maya the Bee films. I think that the story may have described itself as being based off of a fable? \\- I think the movie poster had a bee and grasshopper sitting on a flower or something similar at night time and the cgi for the movie was pretty decent. Definitely a step above from some really low effort kid\u0019s movies. \\- From what I can recall from the plot, there were around three main characters, who were: a kind queen bee, a little girl bee, and a grasshopper. They lived in a small hive town in the grass, there was probably a villain, and I think the grasshopper was poor and maybe played a fiddle. At the very end of the story, the little girl bee takes the queen\u0019s place, and the former queen lives happily ever after with the grasshopper.

Okay so in the pandemic like early 2020, I remember watching this movie were it starts out with a guy on a huge property taking water samples and he meets this new age goth girl who thinks she\u0019s a witch, she\u0019s the daughter of this family who live in a huge property in a forest maybe? And they start experiencing weird shit around the home, there might be a crazy lady who lives on the far end of the property, and it might have been because there were like aliens or other things living in a well in her house and they crawl out and try to kill/or shapeshift into the family members and it becomes like a home invasion movie?? I have been searching for years and have not been able to track it down but I remember it being absolutely batshit so would really like to watch it again, any help would be amazing!", "category": "unsolved", "thread_id": "1li3kmy"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-08-01T16:17:19.314903Z", "updated_at": "2025-08-27T17:02:55.978609Z", "inner_id": 41, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 21, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": [], "stats": {"title_length_chars": 82.0, "text_length_chars": 807.0, "full_post_length_chars": 890.0, "title_length_words": 10.0, "text_length_words": 155.0, "full_post_length_words": 165.0, "title_readability": 14.445454545454549, "text_readability": 20.97923566878981, "full_post_readability": 17.57690476190476, "reply_counter": 4.0, "OP_reply_count": 1.0, "total_labels": 12, "total_unique_labels": 9, "has_plot": true, "plot_character_length": 550, "plot_word_length": 107, "replies_until_solved": "NA", "replies_until_confirmed": "NA", "OP_reply_count_before_confirmed": "NA", "solved_by_OP": "NA", "unique_user_replies": "NA", "unique_user_count": 1.0, "score": 2.0}}, {"id": 26260, "annotations": [{"id": 282, "completed_by": 56, "result": [{"id": "6_4WsyxJGa", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 8, "text": "Old 60\u0019s", "start": 0, "labels": ["Release date"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "4-_gGe2bAj", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 15, "text": "zombie", "start": 9, "labels": ["Topic"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "aC1ayk8gn4", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 21, "text": "zombie movie", "start": 9, "labels": ["Genre"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "yfhQ3HTiee", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 75, "text": "from the 60s or 70s.", "start": 55, "labels": ["Release date"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "1cWgdOeMGe", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 146, "text": "nuclear holocaust and a race of mutants inhabits the earth.", "start": 87, "labels": ["World building"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "fk4WBqkeu9", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 291, "text": "A stronghold of people are living in a house in a valley which has copper embedded in the hills surrounding their compound that keeps them safe.", "start": 147, "labels": ["Plot"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "Q8XJhg7XAq", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 314, "text": "The movie is in color.", "start": 292, "labels": ["Properties"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "0BwdsMGrB5", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 548, "text": "Great drama as the tension builds throughout the movie without showing the mutants outside the compound.

I\u0019m looking for an indie Latin American psychological thriller/horror short that I\u0019ve seen about 10 years ago.

I think the title had \u001c~philia\u001d in it, maybe referencing a fetish related to surgery or amputation. The story was told from the point of view of a doctor/surgeon who saw himself as a generous, selfless man. He had an MTF trans nurse, a beautiful, cheerful, provocative woman that he called his \u001cmasterpiece,\u001d saying he had done her reassignment and cosmetic surgeries himself. One day, a wounded criminal with a bag of money showed up and threatened him with a gun. The doctor tried to calm him down and offered to help, but the man ended up dead. Other things happened, but I can\u0019t remember. (Spoilers from here) The twist was that the doctor wasn\u0019t a real surgeon at all. He was a delusional psychopath, maybe a drug addict. The nurse wasn\u0019t anything like how he saw her: she looked very masculine and botched from bad surgery, and she hated him because he was threatening to cut off her hormone pills if she ever tried to leave or speak out.

Im looking for this movie I saw a review of years ago that I'd love to watch.

Every few minutes they have to vote on a person to kill, so little by little they all die until it's only the protagonist left. At the end it's revealed that it was caused by aliens I believe? I think the point of the movie was to showcase how society prioritizes certain people (the unlikeable people died first while a child and a pregnant woman made it further) and that's what the aliens were studying?

Plot of clip: Man tries to kill what appears to be his best friends wife because she\u0019s a spy/double agent against her husband. From what I recall in the clip they\u0019re all having dinner at someone\u0019s home. One of the guys there is suspicious of his best friend\u0019s wife and her best friend so he kills the wife\u0019s best friend. The husband doesn\u0019t wanna believe that his wife may not actually be who she says she is and he insists to his friend that he took all the necessary precautions and that there\u0019s just no way that his wife isn\u0019t who she says she is. The friend I believe then starts insinuating that the house is bugged and I believe uses radio frequency or something like that to prove to his friend while the wife is begging and pleading for him not to test anything because it\u0019s not true. When it\u0019s revealed that she has the house bugged, she tries to shoot them and escapes. Does anyone know what movie this is??

I only watch a little bit of the movie on TV so I don't have a lot of information. The movie is probably from the 70s, 80s, or 90s or early. It featured a young boy and an old man going on some kind of sea adventure possibly involving a boat, maybe treasure or a quest. The movie was in English. It was probably American or European movie. The story might be set in a fantasy world and medieval tone. The most scene I remember is this: * The old man suddenly seems to hallucinate, he's playing cards with people who aren't really there, and at some point, the old man seems to be tired and his body is slowly collapsing (start to look skeletal or zombie) * The hallucination ends when the young boy shouts and shake him or wakes him up. * The old man seems to be happy and appreciated for what the young boy did. What\u0019s sticking in my mind is that the movie title might have been the the old man's name or something like \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"the adventure of...\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" or \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"wonderful of...\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" in the title.
